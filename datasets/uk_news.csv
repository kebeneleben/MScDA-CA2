His coalition includes far-right settler leaders in top posts. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has built dozens of settlements that are now home to roughly 500,000 Israelis. The Palestinians claim the entire area as part of a future independent state and consider the settlements illegal — a position that is widely shared by the international community. Israel's commitment to deepening its control of the West Bank has threatened to put it on a collision course with some of its closest allies. At a ceremony Sunday, Katz said he would channel resources to promote tourism in the West Bank. “We will invest in areas that may not have received sufficient support to date,” he said. “For example, our local Tuscany in Judea and Samaria,"" he added, using the biblical term for the West Bank favored by religious and right-wing Israelis. The West Bank settler community has developed a small tourism sector that includes hotels, bed and breakfasts and wineries. Israel considers these industries to be part of the country's broader tourism sector, while international human rights groups have said they deepen control of occupied territory. Airbnb in 2018 said it would bar listings in the Israeli settlements, but it quickly backed down under heavy Israeli pressure. Last year, Booking.com said it was adding warnings to its listings there. On Friday, the U.N. General Assembly asked the U.N.'s highest judicial body to give its opinion on the legality of Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank. Netanyahu called the resolution “disgraceful” and said Israel is not obligated to cooperate with the International Court of Justice.",New Israeli government vows to develop West Bank tourism,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-west-bank-israeli-benjamin-netanyahu-tuscany-b2254334.html

It was 1968 and she couldn’t wait to join the world of work, be independent and earn her own money. She was also joining the legions of women who’d recently entered the workforce. Not long after starting the job, Susan went on a site visit with her boss to a new shopping centre he had designed in Liverpool. It was a trip she made a number of times while she worked at the firm over the course of a year. But what seemed an unremarkable part of her job at the time would come back to haunt her 50 years later as, in 2018, Susan was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a deadly form of lung cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. And investigations have shown that during one of those visits to the construction site, lasting just a few hours, asbestos was being sprayed on the ceilings. ‘The diagnosis was quite a shock,’ says Susan, 78, who lives in Pershore, Worcestershire. ‘My parents both lived into their 90s and, as I had no illness or health conditions, my expectation was that I had a good few years’ ahead of me to enjoy life with my two sons and five grandchildren.’ Susan’s experience is becoming increasingly common. Latest figures from Cancer Research UK show that, while men account for most cases of mesothelioma, cases among women rose by 93 per cent between 1993 and 2018 (compared with 47 per cent in men). ‘The proportion of women being diagnosed with mesothelioma has never been higher,’ says Dean Fennell, a professor of thoracic medical oncology at the University of Leicester. ‘Given the disease can take decades to develop, this rise seems to coincide with when more women joined the workforce from the 1950s onwards.’ Roughly 2,700 people in the UK are diagnosed with mesothelioma every year. Asbestos, a flame retardant used in construction in the UK until 1999, is the main cause. Breathing in tiny asbestos fibres can damage the lungs and their lining (the mesothelium) although it can take years, even decades, for symptoms — breathlessness, coughing and chest pain — to develop. As these kinds of symptoms are common to a number of illnesses, mesothelioma is often misdiagnosed or not picked up until the cancer is advanced and treatment is more difficult. ‘Mesothelioma is a devastating and hard-to-treat disease with people often diagnosed at a late stage and typically facing a poor prognosis,’ says Liz Darlison, chief executive of the charity Mesothelioma UK. Mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lung rather than the lung itself, making it different from lung cancer (and asbestosis, which is non-cancerous scarring of the lung tissue caused by asbestos). There are six million tonnes of asbestos in 1.5 million UK buildings, including workplaces, public buildings — even schools — as well as homes, according to research published in 2019 by the think tank ResPublica. The Health and Safety Executive says it is potentially in any industrial or residential building built or refurbished before 2000. Susan first became aware of a problem in January 2018 when she found herself out of breath walking up the stairs at home. ‘It was unusual,’ she says. ‘I’ve kept myself in good shape — I was a yoga teacher for many years — and had never had lung problems. I didn’t think much of it as there were no other symptoms but, when it didn’t go away, I saw my GP. ‘He examined me and could find nothing wrong but said to come back if it persisted.’ Two weeks later, Susan went back to her GP and was sent for an X‑ray. She recalls: ‘As I was putting my coat on the radiographer rushed in and said, “You must go straight to A&E!” A doctor showed me the X-ray, indicating a collapsed lung and fluid in the chest cavity. I was hospitalised for a week so the fluid could be drained.’ Susan needed surgery to re‑inflate the lung but as the NHS couldn’t operate for six weeks, she used her health insurance to go private. ‘During the operation the surgeon took biopsies which revealed the mesothelioma diagnosis,’ says Susan. ‘He told me the average life expectancy for someone in my condition was 15 months. I was just so disappointed.’ Recent breakthroughs mean there are more treatment options for mesothelioma patients, says Professor Fennell: ‘For years we only had chemotherapy, but there’s been a lot happening in this area in the last couple of years which has led to advances in treatment. ‘Following successful trials, last year NICE [the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] approved the first new treatment in over ten years for patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma — which accounts for 90 per cent of cases.’ (This is the form that Susan has.) The treatment is ‘a type of immunotherapy, where we attempt to train the body to fight the disease itself, and is a combination of two drugs: nivolumab and ipilimumab. ‘It can be used now as a first-line treatment for these patients and trials show this gives patients a survival advantage of four months compared with chemotherapy alone.’ For patients whose cancers have grown after chemotherapy, nivolumab also improves survival — by over a month, according to data from the Cancer Research UK-funded CONFIRM trial, led by Professor Fennell. The NHS is now making nivolumab available to these patients. ‘This is a huge breakthrough as many patients only have months to live by the time they are diagnosed,’ says Professor Fennell. New research is focusing on trying to uncover why some mesothelioma patients respond better to treatment than others, by looking at their genes and microbiome, the community of microbes including bacteria that live in the gut. ‘If we can identify mesothelioma’s Achilles’ heel we could target treatments much more effectively,’ says Professor Fennell. Since her diagnosis, Susan has undergone two rounds of chemotherapy followed by nivolumab and ipilimumab — and most recently, in autumn 2022, radiotherapy to reduce pain. And she has done remarkably well. This month it will be five years since she was diagnosed — far exceeding the average life expectancy. ‘The frustrating thing is I am otherwise totally fit and have no other conditions,’ she says. ‘Once they had reinflated my lung, I didn’t really have any symptoms other than the side-effects of chemotherapy. Sadly immunotherapy didn’t work for me.’ But recent scans have shown that the cancer has spread to her ribs and diaphragm and Susan’s breathing is now more difficult. ‘I am still functioning — I can walk for short distances but have got myself a buggy to go to the shops,’ she says. ‘I find standing quite difficult and even the slightest movement has an effect on my breath. ‘I think I am in the last year now and I’ve taken the positive decision not to have more treatment, even though I was offered more chemotherapy and to go on a clinical trial. The benefits, if any, are small and I want to focus on quality of life,’ she says. ‘I have a wonderful GP who is dedicated and the local hospice nurse looks after me both physically and psychologically. All along I have had this overwhelming feeling of disappointment but now, as the end isn’t far off, I am angry.’ Investigations by a solicitor, which included getting hold of original construction notes for the shopping centre, showed with some certainty that it was those site visits in Liverpool more than 50 years ago which had caused Susan’s disease, and she received a payout in 2021 from the Government’s mesothelioma compensation scheme. ‘I want people to be aware that mesothelioma is not just an industrial disease, linked to the building sector — it affects normal people like me who never realised they were putting themselves at risk,’ says Susan. ‘And it is still present in a huge number of hospitals, schools and other public buildings. ‘One woman I know developed it after going into a cellar at school to pick up some files, another from washing overalls belonging to her husband, a builder. He didn’t get mesothelioma, but she did. ‘Research into mesothelioma lags behind many other cancers. We need to put more money into it to find a cure for this disease, not just pay out compensation to those who develop it.’ To donate to research into mesothelioma, visit junehancockfund.org",How cases of deadly asbestos cancer are rising in women,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11592963/How-cases-deadly-asbestos-cancer-rising-women.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Here, we look at all the exhibitions locals and visitors alike will be able to see at the popular Schoolhill venue. These include exhibitions which opened in 2022 but will remain in the gallery for some part of 2023. Pavlovka Pinhole Photography Festival (until February 12) The Pavlovka Pinhole Festival was established in 2017 in Kyiv, Ukraine, to celebrate the playfulness, surprise and magic of pinhole photography. Organised by curator Yuliia Belska, the festival aims to unite international photo artists who use the world’s oldest photographic tradition in their work. Jerwood Art Fund Makers Open (until March 5) A collaboration between Jerwood Arts and Art Fund in partnership with Aberdeen Art Gallery, the exhibition celebrates work by early-career artists and makers Anna Berry, Cecilia Charlton, Jahday Ford, Vicky Higginson, Francisca Onumah and Helena Russell. Showcasing a broad range of material disciplines, including glass, textiles, silversmithing and sculptural installation, the five commissions provide a snapshot of some of the most exciting new work being produced by UK-based artists and makers. Lilli Geissendorfer, Jerwood Arts’ director, said: “Jerwood Art Fund Makers Open creates a vital space for early-career artists and makers to experiment, learn, and take risks with their work. “We have been delighted to co-fund a dedicated curatorial role held by Svetlana Panova to guide this project, investing in essential talent development opportunities in the curatorial sector.” Shadows and Light – The Extraordinary Life of James McBey (February 11 – May 28) The celebrated Aberdeenshire-born artist and adventurer James McBey (1883-1959) was noted for his etchings and dry point engravings, and was once described as the “heir to Rembrandt”. This small-scale exhibition is curated by author Alasdair Soussi to coincide with his recently-published biography of McBey. The author’s research drew on the unparalleled archive of the artist’s personal collection of artworks, sketchbooks, scrapbooks, diaries and letters in the Archives, Gallery & Museums’ collection, a selection of which will be on display. Alasdair Soussi will give a talk at Aberdeen Art Gallery on Saturday April 15. Travelling Gallery (March) The contemporary gallery in a bus will be parked up in Aberdeen with a new two-person exhibition by artist Emmie McLuskey and choreographer Janice Parker which explores movement, bringing dance and people together in different ways and art forms.

The Testament of Alexander Jaffray (March 4 – September 3) 2023 marks the 350th anniversary of the death of Alexander Jaffray, twice provost of Aberdeen and representative of the burgh in the Scottish Parliament. This prominent member of the community later became a Quaker, at a time when doing so would mean persecution. This exhibition uses the manuscript of Jaffray’s last testament, acquired by Aberdeen City & Aberdeenshire Archives in 2022, as the starting point for a closer look at the man himself and the persecution. Where Ideas Are Born – an exhibition by Magnum Photos (April 1 – June 11) This exhibition brings together works by over 20 photographers from the celebrated Magnum agency, including Inge Morath, Eve Arnold and Robert Capa. Around 70 photo portraits of internationally renowned artists capture the moment in their studios. Making a Splash!

This exhibition showcases bathing costumes and other highlights from the Archives, Gallery & Museums’ collection of 20th-century beachwear. Quentin Blake – Illustrating Verse and Book Covers (July 8 – September 17) Two exhibitions under one roof at the Art Gallery will celebrate the unique talent of Quentin Blake, the UK’s best-loved illustrator, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday. Illustrating Verse brings together for the first time a selection Blake’s sketches and illustrations for a range of poetry, from comic nonsense poems to poignant ballads by writers including William Shakespeare and Roald Dahl. Book Covers demonstrates how Blake’s illustrations have grabbed the attention of readers of all ages over the past 60 years. The exhibition includes reproductions of cover artwork and rough sketches which give insights into Blake’s unmistakable and ever-popular way of working. Constructed Narratives: Lennox Dunbar, Ian Howard, Arthur Watson (October 14 – January 28 2024) This exhibition brings together three of Scotland’s foremost artists – Lennox Dunbar, Ian Howard and Arthur Watson. The Aberdeen-born contemporaries were educated at Aberdeen Grammar School, where art teacher Charles Hemingway encouraged them to spend time with the collection of contemporary art at Aberdeen Art Gallery. All three have key early works in the Aberdeen Art Gallery collection, which will be displayed here along with more recent pieces. Over their careers Dunbar, Howard and Watson have exhibited extensively across Europe, the United States and Asia, both together and as solo artists. Provost Skene’s House in 2023 More than 100 remarkable individuals from Aberdeen and the north-east are showcased in new interactive displays.

The Tolbooth Museum – temporarily closed The museum hasn’t reopened since it was shut at the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown in March 2020. A large crack had been discovered in an archway on the ground floor, risking the health and safety of visitors. As more investigations were carried out, more problems were found, including rusting metal embedded in the stonework. Councillors gave the go-ahead to all the necessary works, which would total £1.36 million, in early December. Click here for more information. Aberdeen Maritime Museum – temporarily closed Aberdeen Maritime Museum tells the story of the city’s long relationship with the sea.

It's the opportunity of a lifetime for a business owner, and the 18 entrepreneurs are all hoping to win the £250,000 cash injection and invaluable advice from Lord Sugar. The full line-up for the show has been released ahead of it's return on Thursday and this year's looks more entertaining than ever before. This year's group features nine men and nine women who will all do their best to impress Lord Sugar and his advisors, Baroness Karren Brady, Tim Campbell and Claude Littner. The hit BBC show is now in its 17th season, and marks the first in person launch since 2019 due to the Covid pandemic. It began in 2005 as a groundbreaking show which featured some of the country's best young business minds hoping to secure a job with the then Sir Alan. However the programme has slowly turned into a more reality TV-inspired fare, with big personalities gloating irreverently about their skills in business. Among them are two sweetshop owners, two hairdressers, a martial arts instructor, and a pest control company owner and they will be put through their paces through a series of tricky tasks, with the first set in Antigua. The 20th anniversary of the series will air next year, with Lord Sugar saying he would do 20 years and then retire, having invested over £3million of his own money over the years. Meet all 18 candidates hoping to secure an investment for their business ideas. AVI SHARMA 'Some say I'm delusional, I prefer the term optimistic.' Avi is this year's youngest candidate, and works as a city banker in London. He describes himself as 'confident' and 'optimistic' and says he can 'bring a smile to the most miserable face!' He wants Lord Sugar's investment to help get him out of the 'rat race' of a banking job, boasting: 'I'm the hardest working rat he'll ever meet.' BRADLEY JOHNSON 'I have a business plan that will see us turn over seven figures after year three and who knows where else that could take us.' Bradley is a self-made businessman, who is the director of a construction company in North Yorkshire. He prides himself on his work ethic and drive which he claims has allowed him to create a business that turns over half-a-million after being made redundant just four years ago. He admits that his biggest weakness is public speaking, confessing: 'I was always the shy kid at school, I hated having to stand up and read in English lesson'. DANI DONOVAN 'My biggest weakness is also my biggest strength.' Dani owns a hair salon in Hertfordshire, which she started as a teenager and believes the key to business is 'passion'. She says she has a 'unique' personality and describes herself as 'a different kind of business owner, which is a lot more relatable to people.' Her self-confessed weakness, is 'that nothing is ever good enough and that I always want more. This is a weakness because then I'm never content with what I have achieved. But it's also a humongous strength – it is what has pushed me to come so far.' She believes she deserves to win the programme because her business fills a 'huge gap' in the market, saying: 'It baffles me that no one has done it yet!' DENISHA KAUR BHARJ 'I have always known what I wanted in life. I know the dreams I want to achieve. There's only one Denisha Kaur.' Denisha works as a financial controller in Leicestershire and says she's not afraid of getting out of her comfort zone. She describes herself as 'strong, motivated and hard-working' and says she can work under pressure, overcoming both professional and personal tests to reach success. Denisha says she wants the investment opportunity because she wants to 'be mentored by the best to be the best.' She argues she deserves it, because: 'I'm a woman who wants to create an empire and have it all; to be able to provide for my family and to be an inspiration to young women. I dream big, but I work extra hard and know everything is possible.' EMMA BROWNE 'I am disgustingly competitive. I will go to any lengths to win this investment.' Emma is a senior account executive in County Kildare and says she is 'extremely competitive' and a 'workaholic' who will 'do anything succeed'. She has over five years of hands-on sales experience and says she wants to ensure she will win tasks by being honest about her opinions. Describing her business idea, she says: 'I am confident that whether I win the investment from Lord Sugar or not, I am going to make my company one of the most successful ideas to ever come out of The Apprentice. Watch this space. GREGORY EBBS 'My biggest weakness, some could call a strength in my opinion, is sometimes being a little too unusual.' Gregory is the owner of an online antiques marketplace based in Shropshire and is also a local coucillor, while he previously worked as a professional cannon-firer. He says his USP is 'my ability to think outside the box and try out new and different things' and confesses to being 'slightly more unusual than most'. He says: 'I would say, a willingness to try different things and not being afraid to be slightly different is one of my biggest strengths. Speaking on his business idea, Gregory said: 'I think the chances of making this business super successful is greater than anybody else’s, because it’s such a fantastic principle.' JOSEPH PHILLIPS 'If Lord Sugar wants to invest in a business to help save the ocean, one lip balm at a time, then I’m his guy.' Joseph is a safari guide in South Africa, from Worcestshire and he believes that gives him the edge to be 'unique enough to succeed in the process', describing himself as the 'James Bond of the business world'. He admits that his biggest weakness is his dyslexia and say he 'struggled to keep my head above water' at school and keep up with his peers. But Joseph said the diagnosis has now become a driving force to succeed and go further as he wanted to prove that you can still be anything you want to be with dyslexia. He graciously adds: 'I don’t deserve Lord Sugar’s investment more than anyone else in the process, but I do think I have something that they don’t.' KEVIN D'ARCY 'With Lord Sugar as my business partner, I know we can ride that wave into the UK and beyond…' Kevin is an accountant from Dublin who began his water sports equipment business during lockdown while juggling his job. He claims his business has turned over just under half a million in two years and says that combined with his 10-year career in financial service sets him apart from the rest. Kevin admits his biggest weakness to be: 'I can be a little outspoken, so probably not knowing when to shut up.' MARK MOSELEY 'If Lord Sugar doesn’t pick me, then he’s missing a trick.' Mark is the owner of a pest control company in London, arguing that Lord Sugar can invest because the industry is worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year in the UK. He is also a former soldier who has worked all over the world in remote and hostile environments, meaning he should be right at home in the boardroom. He describes himself as 'very talkative with the charm to match – I can sell to anyone' and claims to have met celebrities and members of the royal family. Mark confesses he can be 'a little bit over-confident from time to time' but explains that 'people buy into confidence'. MARNIE SWINDELLS 'I have fought tooth and nail to get to where I am today with my business.' Marnie is a court advocate in London who is also a gold medal-winning boxer and imaginative businesswoman who is ready to face off against the other candidates. She says her USP is her 'imagination and creativity' but admits her passion and eagerness can sometimes translate as being too 'headstrong'. She says she deserves Lord Sugar's investment because: 'I think that taking the experience I have in the boxing industry and all the experience that he has in the business industry, together we would be a winning combination.' MEGAN HORNBY 'I think that no matter what situation I am thrown into, I will always give one hundred percent truth, even if it’s hard to hear.' Megan is the owner of a sweet shop and café in East Yorkshire and says her business has a 'real niche' in a gap in the market. She says her biggest asset is her honesty, saying it's the 'most important thing in business'. Her biggest weakness is her ambition, confessing: 'I can take too many things on, and sometimes I need to focus on certain aspects.' She says she should have the £250k because: 'I really think that with Lord Sugar’s investment, my business could be nationally recognised'. REECE DONNELLY 'I'm going to be turning over a million pounds before I’m thirty.' Reece is the owner of a performing arts school in Glasgow who is determined to become the first Scottish candidate to secure Lord Sugar's investment. He says he is the youngest CEO of a further education college in the UK and says he has 'all the experience, drive, and personality' to succeed. He admits that he can be guilty of neglecting the grunt work, saying: 'Admin or accounting tasks aren’t quite for me' but that this makes him a better leader who is able to delegate. Reece says he wants to prove: 'Scotland is filled with forward-thinking entrepreneurs and that we are not in fact a haggis-eating, kilt-wearing nation.' ROCHELLE ANTHONY 'I’m always being compared to the Kim Kardashian of the business world because I’m doing business with a hint of glam.' Rochelle owns a hair salon and academy in Bedfordshire and has compared herself to Kim Kardashian in the business world. She describes herself as 'tenacious, fierce and determined' and says together with Lord Sugar they would be 'an absolute force to be reckoned with.' According to Rochelle, her biggest weakness is she doesn't like the word 'no' and can't let go, instead turning it into a 'not yet', but learns from her mistakes. SHANNON MARTIN 'Lord Sugar needs to be my next business partner, so I can make him millions.' Shannon is the owner of bridal boutique from West Yorkshire and is hoping to be the first business partner to bring Lord Sugar into the lucrative bridal industry. She admits she struggles to prioritise and plan because 'I want everything now' and that it can cause a bit of stress. She believes she deserves the investment because: 'There are not many other businesses that design, and manufacture wedding dresses made solely in the UK, which is exactly what my business plan is.' SHAZIA HUSSAIN 'I don’t need any friends in business. I am here to win this.' Shazia is a technology recruiter in London and wants to inspire a varied representation of diverse women in the world of business. She says her ADHD is both her USP and biggest weakness, saying she can process information faster, react quicker and see things differently, but can lose concentration quickly. She says she should get the win because: 'It’s important to see a varied representation of women, including women with neurodiversity in business, as people with neurodiversity are linked to being increasingly successful within the corporate sector. I hope that I’ll encourage more people like me not to be ashamed of their difference.' SIMBA RWAMBIWA 'My USP is myself. If people can’t buy into you, they’ll never buy anything from you.' Simba is a senior sales representative from Birmingham and says he's a perfectionist as he always wants to 'get things right'. He says he deserves the investment opportunity because his business guarantee prpfit, 'but also guarantees to improve the quality of peoples’ lives'. SOHAIL CHOWHARY 'I am calm and collected, but if they do come at me? I will bite and I will sting, and I will leave my mark.' Sohail owns a martial arts school in Southampton and wants the otehr candidates to be 'wary' of him. He says his biggest asset is 'turning my laziness into a positive by creating smart solutions and simple shortcuts to difficult problems.' He admits his biggest weakness is not listening to others when 'on the very rare occasion I might be wrong' but says: 'I’ll always be the person that looks out for the little guy and sometimes that means that I will put emotions before business.' Sohail is proud to have grown up in a council house and worked his way up and adds: 'Owning a martial arts business means Lord Sugar can learn how to kick ass for free.'

Around half of Britain’s railway lines are closed and only a fifth of services are running as tens of thousands of workers at Network Rail and train operators walk out on the second day of the strike with bus drivers joining them. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction and said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline,” he wrote. Transport for London has revealed that bus strikes will take place today and tomorrow on Abellio bus services. There will still be buses available on the affected routes in south and west London, but not in their usual numbers. Meanwhile, industrial action by the UK-wide National Highways and Rural Payments Agency staff will continue. Recommended Who’s on strike today?

It wasn’t until this past year watching Musk, Johnson, Trump, King Charles, Truss, Clarkson (who is not out of the woods, however much cover The Sun give him) etc that it occurred to me that, if you are patient enough and prepared to witness massive collateral damage and waste of resources and unnecessary heartache, worsening socio-economic inequality and the debasement of living conditions for the most vulnerable – “they” implode...

Rishi Sunak has been warned that his “high risk” strategy on public sector pay rises could backfire, as an exclusive poll for The Independent showed strong public support for fresh strikes in 2023. Almost two in three voters would back NHS nurses taking more strike action next year if their pay demands are not met, the Savanta poll found, with only 24 per cent opposed. In addition, more voters expressed support for fresh industrial action by rail staff, bus drivers, postal workers and teachers than those who said they were opposed to further strikes. Adam Forrest reports: What does Britain really think about the strikes? As unions and government continue their stand-off, voters are still backing the workers who have chosen to walk out, polling finds – and they support more strikes in the new year, Adam Forrest reports Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 02:48 1672796880 As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be a good year for the unions After decades when it was – sadly – usually safe to ignore the pronouncements of union leaders, the most widespread outbreak of industrial action since 1979 has meant that they are household names once again. Not yet as familiar as, say, Mick Lynch, is the brand new general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, who formally takes over from Frances (now Baroness) O’Grady on 1 January. He is, though, making a somewhat loud entrance. He told The Independent that the strikes could carry on throughout 2023 if the government refuses to negotiate over pay rises. If we take ministers at their word, that they won’t do so until at least the new public pay body recommendations arrive in April, then the country is in for a prolonged period of conflict. Writes Sean O’Grady: As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be good for the unions The economic reality is on the side of the unions, and Rishi Sunak lacks Thatcher’s sharp political instinct, writes Sean O'Grady Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 01:48 1672793280 I’m a nurse – this is why I voted to strike Ever since I was a young child, I dreamt of being a nurse that worked for the NHS. Twelve years ago, after lots of hard work and determination, I achieved that goal. There were lots of sacrifices from my family, who supported me throughout my course. I currently work as a deputy sister in an NHS hospital in Lincolnshire. My role is as part of an acute cardiology team that has face to face contact with patients that attend the hospital after having heart attacks and following cardiac arrests.

Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 23:34 1672786137 Who is striking this winter and why? Workers in several of Britain’s key service sectors are striking in what is being called the new “winter of discontent” as cost of living pressures clash with below-inflation pay offers. Many strikes, such as that of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), have been going on for months, with warnings union members will vote to take their fight far into 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the highest monthly total since November 2011 saw mass public sector walkouts over pension reforms. Liam James reports: Who is striking this winter and why? Workers are walking out in droves over the coming weeks Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 22:48 1672783170 Bus strikes planned for Wednesday TfL has said that strike are planned for Wednesday and Thursday on Abellio bus services. On the strike days, TfL writes that they intend to run as many services as possible, but expect disruption. Routes affected by the strikes are, for the most part, in west and south London. Other bus services will not be affected.

P&J Comment,84719396,http://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/01/The-Courier-Opinion-Website2-James-Withers-1-1-29b3te5mp.jpg,en,2023-01-04 07:00:04,0.009,GB,"Wild salmon are struggling to survive in Scotland, and the entire fishing industry must come together to save it, writes Tavish Scott of Salmon Scotland. The wild salmon is one of Scotland’s most iconic species, earning its place alongside the red deer, the golden eagle, and the Scottish wildcat. But, like so many other animals, its numbers have been in decline for decades. The population of wild salmon is diminishing on the west coast of Scotland, and even faster on the east coast. Reasons for the fall are many and varied, but a key cause is habitat loss and rising river temperatures, due to climate change. The Scottish Government has also identified other pressures facing wild salmon, including predation by fish, birds and seals, as well as the non-native plans that erode riverbanks. Man-made barriers to migration, such as weirs and bridge foundations, lead to further challenges for the fish, impeding their migration to spawning grounds and increasing the likelihood of them being eaten. The sad truth is that a wild Atlantic salmon now has a miniscule survival rate of only around 1-2%. That contrasts sharply with farm-raised salmon, where the survival rate is around 85% over their two years in the cold seas off Scotland’s west coast. Daily animal husbandry from our salmon farmers, supported by the best vets in the land, has developed world-leading expertise in hatching and rearing salmon that thrive at sea. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part There are a handful of vocal activists, often from urban centres far from rural Scotland, determined to shut down salmon farms – which would make 12,000 people unemployed amid a cost of living crisis – who mistakenly believe that this would somehow help wild salmon. They have no explanation, of course, for the fact that wild salmon numbers are declining at the same rate on the east coast, where there has never been any salmon farming. What is needed is collaboration, not confrontation. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part in finding solutions, engaging constructively with the wild fish sector, and taking meaningful action to save wild salmon. They are determined, for example, to share their knowledge and experience to support wild fisheries with restocking. Fortunately, most people in the fisheries and angling sectors in the Highlands and Islands recognise the importance of a healthy, shared environment, ensuring fish can thrive in our waters. People like Jon Gibb, a fisheries manager based in Fort William, get that. He has long championed a constructive relationship between the farm-raised salmon sector and fisheries and angling groups, arguing that “both the farmed and wild salmon sectors have a common interest to thrive in our shared space”. I agree, which is why I’m delighted that Jon has agreed to coordinate our revamped £1.5 million “wild fisheries fund”, which is paid for directly by Scotland’s salmon farming companies. Funding to protect our salmon heritage The Scottish salmon sector has already funded projects to save and restore a historic dam in the Western Isles that assists wild salmon to progress to their spawning grounds, as well as restoration projects across Scotland that will reduce riverbank erosion and provide tree canopy and in-stream cover for young salmon. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks In the coming year, £145,000 will be available to a broad range of organisations and projects. Applications are invited from fisheries organisations, including local angling clubs, fishery boards and other community associations. The revamped fund will prioritise applications of a practical nature, which aim to protect and enhance wild salmon populations and local angling opportunities, recognising that salmon and trout fishing is at the cultural heart of many Highland communities, and provides human health benefits. Projects could include removing migration barriers, evidence-based and authorised restocking programmes, hatchery-based operations using contemporary techniques, such as genetic screening, and freshwater habitat improvement, like spawning gravel creation. Money is also available for improvements to angling facilities, including riverside paths, boats and buildings, as well as initiatives to support young and disabled anglers. Scottish salmon is part of our national story. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks. We recognise that today’s Scottish salmon farming sector enjoys its strong reputation and success partly due to this heritage. It is in all of our interests to ensure that we protect our freshwater and seawater environment so that one of Scotland’s most iconic species can recover and thrive.

Hardies Property & Construction Consultants is currently renovating its offices in the city. Once the offices on Albert Square are ready, bosses plan to have staff from Hardies and its sister company Shepherds working under the same roof. They will be joined by workers from the recently-acquired John Duguid Partnership. Hardies investment in Dundee offices Gareth Cordiner, the firm’s north division managing partner, believes this will make a real difference. He said: “It’s hugely important especially after Covid. We do have a flexible working policy but we’ve found people want to be back in the office and back together. “The amount of information you share from hearing it across the room, it makes a big difference. “From a mental health point of view it’s brilliant.

British wrestler Zack Sabre Jr, who has been vocally anti-Tory in the past, stepped out for a high stakes match at New Japan Pro Wrestling’s (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom 17 event in front of a packed Tokyo Dome crowd. With a global audience tuning in to see former WWE superstar Sasha Banks make her heavily rumoured debut, the 35-year-old grappler took his opportunity to shine a light on the action being taken by the Royal College of Nursing (RNC). Back in November, for the first first time in its 106 year history the RNC voted in favour of strikes, as walkouts affected hospitals across the country with more set to take place on January 18 and 19. Zack has joined those criticising the government over the dispute, and he sent a very blunt message for the Prime Minister as he made his entrance on Wednesday (January 4). Looking straight down the camera, he said: ‘Hey Rishi Sunak! Pay nurses, d**khead! Pay nurses a living wage!’ Zack has a message for the prime minister pic.twitter.com/ECbWf0EX1O— Elijah (@eli1ah) January 4, 2023 Zack Sabre Jr has fans around the world (Picture: Etsuo Hara/Getty Images) Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said last month that the union had ‘no choice’ but to arrange the upcoming strikes. She said: ‘The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January. ‘The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.’ The union is campaigning for a five percent pay rise above inflation to help nurses overcome those real-terms pay cuts, to support nursing staff through the cost of living crisis and recognise their critical skills. There are also record nursing vacancies, with 25,000 nursing staff having quit in the past year, but Mr Sunak previously said while the government was open to talks, a demand for a 19% pay rise wasn’t affordable. He told BBC News NI in December: ‘The health secretary has always been clear that his door is always open for talks – we want to be reasonable, we want to be constructive. ‘We’ve got enormous gratitude for all public sector workers for the job they do, and I know things are difficult right now.’ Got a story?

Al-Quds reported that they had been deported for a range of reasons, including drug abuse, theft, expiration of residency and acting against the public interest. Egyptians are the largest expat group in Kuwait, constituting 24 per cent of the workforce, though that number looks set to reduce as the government works on controlling the labour market and reducing the number of expats across all sectors, particularly within the government. In 2018 Kuwait's Civil Service Commission issued a decree to replace expats in government jobs with Kuwaitis over the next five years. Since then, authorities have rolled out a series of measures aimed at reducing foreign workers in the country. In 2020 Kuwait's parliament said it wanted to reduce the number of Egyptians in the country to ten per cent and introduced a draft law to that effect. In December this year the Kuwaiti government imposed new conditions on Egyptian workers wishing to travel to the Gulf State including a $100 entry fee, an increased work permit documentation fee and a medical examination. READ: Kuwait: death sentence for man who killed woman who refused his advances At the time, Deputy Prime Minister Talal Al-Khaled suspended a 2018 memorandum of understanding which was originally signed to facilitate recruitment between the two countries but did not officially inform Egypt it was being terminated. Four months earlier Kuwait announced that it would lay off 250,000 Egyptian workers and suspend all contracts with non-nationals as 500,000 other Egyptians were already set to lose their jobs. Egyptians have suffered racism in the Gulf country with a video of a Kuwaiti customer slapping an Egyptian cashier two years ago going viral. One influencer called Egyptians ""filthy servants."" Even though they are the largest expatriate group in Kuwait, Egyptians lack employment rights and safety provision. In November last year an Egyptian construction worker was killed in Kuwait allegedly after his colleagues dumped rubbish on him from the third floor after not realising he was below them. A 2015 report on migrant rights found that industry corruption, including overextending project timelines and using cheap materials, put construction workers at risk.

Mr Whelan told PA he felt rail employers and the Government were “playing games” rather than making any serious attempt to resolve the pay dispute. “The situation is getting worse and my members now want to go harder and faster because of the lack of progress. “We are in a weird world where the Government will do anything to keep private companies in the industry. “It is inevitable that more strikes will be held and probably escalate. “The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government.

Next, we need to stop seeing education is something that ends at age 18 or that sees university as the only option with more technical education, lifelong learning and apprenticeship,” he said. We're holding the first BUSINESSiQ Awards - to nominate someone, CLICK HERE He told an audience in Stratford: “One of the biggest changes in mindset we need in education today is to reimagine our approach to numeracy. Right now, just half of all 16 to 19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills, is letting our children down.” Rishi Sunak (Image: PA) Grant Glendinning, Chief Executive and Group Principal at Education Training Collective (Etc.), replied: “I fully agree with the Prime Minister, opportunity is intrinsically linked with education – ensuring that learners have access to the best possible learning experiences. However, while maths, and English, are important and critical foundations of any education pathway towards employment, they do not work in isolation. ""Skills as a whole, starting with English and maths, developed from primary into secondary education, supported by additional learning and development in further education or in the workplace as part of an apprenticeship or T Level, are what will see our young people best positioned to take advantage of the careers and opportunities they pursue, supporting the economic growth of our country. Grant Glendinning (Image: Press release) It will be interesting to understand how this will be rolled out, but with the best interests of our learners and our communities firmly at the heart of Etc. colleges, it is difficult to see how enhanced skills development can be anything but a positive.” Zoe Lewis, Principal and Chief Executive of Middlesbrough College, told us: ""The UK is one of the few developed nations that reduces the time spent in education from around 25 hours per week from the age of 5 to 16 years old to around 16 hours per week between the ages of 16 and 18. Zoe Lewis (Image: Press release) ""We would welcome any opportunity to increase the hours available to continue the development of key skills required for life and the workplace in our young people, whether this be mathematics, English, digital, physical education or employability skills. ""Whilst we would not necessarily single out mathematics from the list of priority skills, we would very much support any increase in investment between in the ages of 16 and 18, alongside a clear plan as to how we can develop and train the increased numbers of teachers that would be required, in light of the current shortages across the sector."" Henri Murison, Chief Executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership said businesses needed young people who were ready for work: ""The Prime Minister is right to be concerned about the progress made by disadvantaged children in this country,"" he said. ""It is simply not good enough that 60% of children do not receive a high enough grade at GCSE in maths to make it on to a T-Level course or other vocation routes to further study. Henri Murison (Image: Press release) ""However it's worth noting that already many young people are studying maths post 16 through resits, in order to get the grade they need to make it through to the system to achieve a higher level of skills.

""The schools minister also needs to sort out funding for disadvantaged children - starting off by reversing the cuts to opportunity areas.

After the disappointments of the previous decade, this was to be the time when the global economy powered up and got going again. There would be a flowering of new technologies and a colossal boom. It would be the roaring 20s all over again. It hasn’t worked out like that. Instead, the world faces the grim prospect of a second recession in three years. The three biggest economies – the United States, China and the European Union, which between them account for roughly half of all global output – are slowing at the same time. That’s unusual and troubling. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, says a third of the world economy will be in recession in 2023, and even for countries that manage to keep growing it will feel like a recession. The IMF has got it wrong – sometimes seriously wrong – in the past but even so, Georgieva’s pessimism is warranted. Just about every indicator of looming recession is flashing red. Prices are rising faster than wages, reducing consumer spending power. Corporate profitability is being squeezed by rising costs and weakening demand. Developing countries that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are now finding their debt burdens unmanageable. The two big asset bubbles of the post-pandemic era – crypto-currencies and tech stocks – both collapsed in 2022. Central banks are raising interest rates, exposing the vulnerability of “zombie” companies that have survived only thanks to a prolonged period of low interest rates. It is a lot cheaper in the US to borrow money for 10 years than it is to borrow money for one year. In the past this unusual phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale sign of a recession in the offing. China hauled the global economy out of its last serious downturn but is in no shape to do so this time. House prices have been rising at double-digit rates for the past three decades but are now falling in many cities because the boom has led to more and more homes being built. Politically, President Xi Jinping cannot afford a house price crash so he can bring demand and supply back into balance only by curbing property construction. That, coupled with the increase in coronavirus cases since the end of the zero tolerance approach to Covid-19, means China is the country to watch in 2023. The IMF says that for the first time since the early 1990s, China will grow less quickly than the global economy as a whole. It could be worse than the IMF envisages. So, the big question is not whether the global economy is in for a rough year in the 12 months ahead, because that is clearly the case. There may be one or two countries that buck the trend, but the UK is not going to be one of them. Another year of underperformance will keep the debate about Brexit alive, even though adjustment to life outside the EU is not the only – let alone the principal reason – for the UK’s current predicament. This is a global rather than a UK-specific problem, and it predates Brexit. Nor is the question why the bounce-back from the Covid-19 pandemic has been cut short, because that too is obvious. The post-lockdown recovery was built on the shakiest of foundations. Shortages led to a burst of inflation, amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks in the west found themselves powerless to combat a cost of living crisis other than by jacking up interest rates. The recessions or near recessions that will be seen in the US, the EU and the UK this year are no accident. They are a deliberate act of policy, which central bankers justify by saying it is a choice between pain now or more pain later. No, the real issue is whether the roaring 20s have been delayed or will never arrive. Put another way: is the global economy facing a temporary, if nasty, period of stagflation (a combination of weak growth and high inflation) or something deeper: a crisis of capitalism? And if it is the latter, what can be done about it? History may well repeat itself. The 1920s began with a pandemic, an inflationary boom and a deep recession. It took a while for better times to arrive, and when they did the driving force was a wave of new inventions, first developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but which took time to reveal their full potential. Techno-optimists say artificial intelligence and biotechnology will be to the 2020s what radio and the motorcar were to the 1920s: the catalyst for a period of markedly faster growth. They believe a period of abnormally lower interest rates has held back a fourth industrial revolution by allowing no-hoper companies to stagger on. A period of creative destruction will see this misallocation of capital end, leading to higher investment in the industries of the future. But the global economy has now been in the doldrums for 15 years. Money has been cheap and plentiful ever since the banks nearly went bust during the global financial crisis. There is not much evidence to suggest that the fourth industrial revolution is being held back by a shortage of capital. Rather, there has been a reluctance by both governments and the private sector to invest. Governments could have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs to rebuild clapped-out infrastructure, but failed to do so. The private sector preferred to use profits to buy back shares rather than taking a punt on new products. Financial engineering proved lucrative for elites, who assumed – quite wrongly – that because the system was working for them it was working for everybody. In one respect, the roaring 20s have already returned. While living standards are being squeezed for the many, for the super-rich it is a new gilded age. Three factors were behind the massive jump in productivity in the middle decades of the 20th century: ideas, investment and the struggle against inequality. Economies only really started to motor when new products were available to the masses through policies that encouraged full employment, collective bargaining and rising wages. Currently, there are plenty of ideas but the other two factors are missing. Until that changes, the global economy will be stuck in its low-growth rut.

It is estimated just 10% of services will be running on one of the worst days of action for decades. Around 12,500 train drivers from 15 firms will take part in the mass walkout. It comes as over the last week we have seen strike action from 40,000 workers on Network Rail and 14 train operating companies who have continued to strike. RMT members were on strike for 48 hours causing travel chaos for people across the UK. But today it is the turn of Aslef – which represents 96% of the train drivers in England, Scotland and Wales – who will continue into their second day of strikes in two days. Rail workers on the picket line at Grand Central Station in Birmingham yesterday (Picture: PA) MORE : What strikes are planned around New Year 2023? Trains, London buses, road workers and more The strike will bring services on affected lines to a halt and comes as more and more people in many different sectors of the economy are withdrawing their labour as employers refuse to help their employees during the cost-of-living crisis. But it’s not the end, as those from The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers are also set to walk out tomorrow and on Friday. It includes train drivers at 15 rail operators and is likely to shut down much of the country’s rail network. On all five days of action, trains will start later and finish much earlier than usual, running between 7.30am and 6.30pm, National Rail has warned. Tickets for 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 January can instead be used the day before the date on the ticket, or up to and including Tuesday 10 January. Timeline of strikes over the next few weeks – January 5 Train workers at 15 operators with the Aslef union to stage a 24-hour walkout.

Train drivers are joined today by London bus workers at Abellio, who are striking for eight days in total this month. Abellio buses have been affected on strike days – with other buses running but busier than usual. The action started back on December 8, but the bus strike dates around New Year included today and yesterday. Dozens of buses in London are going to be impacted by strikes. Rural Payments Agency (RPA) staff will also resume their strikes. Driving tests have likewise been disrupted today – with DVSA driving examiners’ strike starting in London, the South East, South Wales and the South West. ‘We don’t want to go on strike but the companies have pushed us into this place,’ said Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He added: ‘They have not offered our members at these companies a penny – and these are people who have not had an increase since April 2019. ‘That means they expect train drivers at these companies to take a real-terms pay cut – to work just as hard for considerably less – when inflation is running at north of 14%.’ Mick said: ‘The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us. ‘We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing. And that is unacceptable.’ Yesterday TUC (Trades Union Congress) leader Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of ‘underfunding and understaffing’. He wrote: ‘We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. ‘Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. ‘This is simply unsustainable. ‘But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. ‘That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.’ The mass strike action could cause chaos for commuters (Picture: Getty) Driving examiners and supporters picket outside a Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency office in a strike yesterday (Picture: Getty) MORE : Why aren’t the police allowed to go on strike and is any other profession banned? MORE : Brits heading back to work face worst rail strikes yet with five days of action Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: ‘That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. ‘Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. ‘But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. ‘In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. ‘This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. ‘We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love. ‘And so our public services can start to improve for everyone who relies on them.’ RMT general secretary Mick Lynch warned on Tuesday that industrial action will need to continue beyond May unless a reasonable offer to resolve the row over pay, jobs and conditions is made to the union.

The latest statistics on Scotland’s energy production (not oil and gas reserves) showed that over the first nine months of 2022, generation was up 34.7% compared to the same period in 2021 Final figures for 2021 show that the equivalent of 85.2% of all electricity used in Scotland (total generation minus net exports) came from renewable sources. Due to slightly better weather in 2021 this was actually a slight decrease, but has bounced back up again with the 2022 figures. The energy that is generated in Scotland is exported into the UK National Grid. Consumers in Scotland then buy it back. The further north you go in Scotland the tariff paid for buying it back, increases. So although places like Orkney and the massive windfarms in the north of mainland Scotland are producing well over their own needs in renewables, they are also paying the highest prices to buy back their own locally produced power. Scotland produces most of its renewable energy through wind but hydro is also very important. The future with wave and tidal power makes Scotland’s future as a producer of clean energy very bright. Oil and Gas in the UK Scotland still produces large amounts of fossil fuels through its existing extensive oil and gas fields. The income generated from these sources goes into the UK Exchequer. The UK Government is also very keen to open up more oil and gas fields. Figures from the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) The oil and gas industry plays a central role in the economy of the United Kingdom. Oil and gas account for more than three-quarters of the UK’s total primary energy needs. Oil provides 97 per cent of the fuel for transport, and gas is a key fuel for heating and electricity generation. Transport, heating and electricity each account for about one-third of the UK’s primary energy needs. Oil and gas are also major feedstocks for the petrochemicals industries producing pharmaceuticals, plastics, cosmetics and domestic appliances. Wikipedia Click on this link for more information on UK Oil and Gas: North Sea Transition Authority Scotland’s Renewable Production Energy is mostly a reserved power to the UK Government. The Scottish Government has planning power over the development of wind farms as we have seen recently in Orkney (OIC Faray Windfarm Approved by Scottish Government Despite Reporter’s Recommendation to Refuse ) and licences to develop offshore wind. (Islanders Attend Consultation Events for the West of Orkney Windfarm) There is a major expansion of the wind generation sector in Scotland. In the last twelve months, renewable electricity capacity has risen, up 11.7% from September 2021 to 13.6 GW in September 2022. As of September 2022, 397 renewable electricity projects with a capacity of 17.1 GW are being progressed. 3.4 GW of these are under construction, most of which are offshore wind farms off the Moray Firth. 6.8 GW are awaiting construction and 6.9 GW in planning. The generation and use of energy is a complex picture in Scotland. As part of the UK and with a devolved system of government, control over energy is mostly reserved to the London Government. Oil and Gas is a major sector. The UK Government intends to expand both this and Nuclear production. As well as producing energy we also need to use less but as the weather in 2022 was better for renewable generation it also made our homes and businesses harder to heat. Fuel poverty should not exist in a country which generates so much energy – but it does because we do not control the price or have the means to do so. Scottish Government funded schemes to make our homes and businesses more energy efficient are extremely important (more about that here, Home Energy Scotland). But Scotland still relies very much on fossil fuels.

There is a cost to our landscape and seascape. But, in a climate emergency why is the UK Government developing non-renewable energy sources? And where is the hope for Scots struggling to pay their energy bills when they pay the highest rates in the UK to buy back that same power they see being generated where they live?

The Department for Transport (DfT) rejects the accusation, saying ministers have held “polite, constructive meetings” with union bosses. Train drivers employed by 15 rail firms have walked out for 24 hours in a dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions. It is the sixth Aslef drivers’ strike since summer 2022, and is bracketed by 48-hour stoppages by the main rail union, the RMT. Many operators will run no trains on Thursday. Ahead of the walk-out, Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, blamed ministers for triggering the strike. He told The Independent: “We currently have government that seems to want to destroy the railway and put it into managed decline, alienate the workforce, drive passengers off it by increasing fares on a regular basis and causing the problems that are currently there. “We find ourselves in a cycle of – I can only say – corruption, really. The government destroying the railway. The government’s caused this, the government can solve it.” The Department for Transport (DfT) rejected the comments, saying that the transport secretary Mark Harper and rail minister Huw Merriman had been talking to union leaders about their desire for a thriving railway. A spokesperson for the DfT said: “The transport secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long-term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation, and costing every household an extra £1,000.” When Mr Harper entered office 10 weeks ago, he said his top priority was to end the long and bitter tangle of rail disputes between Network Rail, the train operators and the unions. Another two-day RMT strike begins at midnight, causing the cancellation of four out of five trains across Great Britain and disrupting services until Sunday.

The events were created by Developing the Young Workforce (DYW) Inverness & Central Highland, in collaboration with the UHI Inverness college and Skills Development Scotland. They gave S2-S4 Inverness school pupils the opportunity to engage directly with NHS Highland workers and other employers, in a bid to help them make better informed decisions about their future careers. NHS Highland hosted stalls centred around a range of different professions under the health and care umbrella including healthcare science, medical, nursing, dental, midwifery, pharmacy, and adult social care. At each stall teams carried out different interactive “hands-on” activities with young people to provide some experience and educate them about the different services and job roles. Activities showcased included basic life support, clinical skills demonstrations, birthing activities, mental health awareness and dementia awareness with insights into the challenges posed for older adults, and much more.

Danske Bank has revised its previous forecast of a 0.5% annual fall in economic activity in 2023 downwards and now expects output to contract by about 1% next year. It believes the retail sector will be worst affected by recession, shrinking by 4.5% in 2023, more than twice a predicted contraction rate of 2.2% for this year. Conor Lambe, Danske Bank chief economist, said: “The UK economy contracted in the third quarter of 2022 and we think that economic activity in Northern Ireland is also likely to have declined. Output is then projected to fall further in the final quarter of the year and through most of next year, with both economies experiencing a period of recession as a number of factors adversely impact activity levels. “Inflation is expected to decline gradually during 2023 but remain elevated and weigh down on household purchasing power. Consumer confidence is also particularly low and monetary policy is tightening. “Looking forward, and while noting the considerable uncertainty around the outlook, we expect annual output in Northern Ireland to decline by around 1% next year.” But the bank has forecast that the economy will have grown by around 4% by the end of this year, reflecting a relative improvement on the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses and consumers have been hit by rising costs throughout 2022, with inflation prompting the Bank of England to increase interest rates to 3%. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK economy shrank by 0.3% over the three months to October, although there was a rebound in October itself. As well as retail, other consumer-facing sectors such as accommodation and food, along with arts, entertainment and recreation, are also predicted to take heavy hits during 2023. Danske Bank forecast declines of nearly 4% for both sectors. And output for manufacturing companies is also expected to shrink next year, with a 1.1% fall in output, while the construction sector is tipped for a similar rate of contraction. However, slight growth is predicted for the world of information and communication, as well as scientific and technical services.

The Business Department announced that a Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure that vital public services will have to maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike.Minimum safety levels will be set for fire, ambulance and rail services and the Government said it will consult on the “adequate level of coverage” for these sectors.The announcement was made amid a wave of strikes, including a walkout by train drivers on Thursday which crippled rail services.Unions reacted with fury to the move, saying it would do nothing to resolve the disputes breaking out across the country every week.Business Secretary Grant Shapps said: “We hugely value the work of our public services and we’re reaching out to unions to have an honest conversation on pay, conditions and reform.“Industrial action is disruptive for everyone – from people relying on essential services to get to work or care for their family to hard-working business owners whose sales suffer. It also costs those striking at a time when family budgets are tight.“As well as protecting the freedom to strike, the Government must also protect life and livelihoods. While we hope that voluntary agreements can continue to be made in most cases, introducing minimum safety levels – the minimum levels of service we expect to be provided – will restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption.” The Government said it will invite unions to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about what is fair and affordable in public sector pay settlements for 2023/24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged industrial action.A statement said: “Ministers are reaching out to unions to invite them to sit down and discuss the evidence that the Government will be submitting to the pay review bodies – and hopes that unions will also share their evidence.“If the offer is accepted, discussions will take place between government departments and unions in the coming weeks on issues including pay evidence, workload and conditions in the public sector.“These discussions will help ensure the evidence submitted to the pay review bodies is as considered and informed as possible, including reflecting areas of common ground.“The Government is clear that the well-established independent pay review process is the right way to set public sector pay – it provides independent, expert advice and is a neutral process in which all parties play a role. “These new discussions would feed into this process and are offered as the Government recognises the particular economic challenges the country faces this year.”The Government called on the unions to cancel upcoming strikes in a bid to resolve the disputes “constructively through dialogue”.“However, the Government also has a duty to the public to ensure their safety, protect their access to vital public services, and help them go about their daily lives,” the statement said.“The Government will always protect the ability to strike, but it must be balanced with the public’s right to life and livelihoods.“That’s why the Government will introduce new laws to ensure a basic level of service in some of our most crucial sectors when industrial action takes place.”Gary Smith, GMB general secretary, said: “A Government that has presided over 13 years of failure in our public services is now seeking to scapegoat the NHS staff and ambulance workers who do so much to care for the people of our country.“The NHS can only function with the goodwill of its incredible staff and attacking their fundamental right to take action will alienate them even further and do nothing to help patients and the public.“We are always ready to discuss our members’ pay but the Government is refusing to talk about problems as they exist now, instead they want to kick the can down the road.“There are huge questions over the NHS Pay Review Body, as ministers’ actions have consistently undermined its independence. The process needs real reform and our members need a much stronger commitment than we heard today.”The announcement said unions would be bound to follow the legislation and would risk employers bringing an injunction to prevent strikes from taking place or seeking damages if they did not comply.",Government pressing ahead with &amp;lsquo;minimum safety levels&amp;rsquo; legislation,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/government-pressing-ahead-with-minimum-safety-levels-legislation-42264571.html

The £2.6m initiative will be introduced across 55 education investment areas, or “cold spots”, where school outcomes are the weakest, targeting 600,000 pupils in more than 2,200 primary schools. Pupils will get the chance to meet employers and “role models” from a range of industries, to try to raise aspirations and link learning to future jobs and careers they may pursue. They will be introduced to careers in the green economy, technology, engineering, construction, Stem, creative industries, aerospace, hospitality and healthcare. The Department for Education (DfE) said evidence had shown that children started to form ideas about their future when they began primary school, yet most careers guidance took place in secondary schools. In addition to the primary careers programme, the DfE also gave details of a new requirement for secondary school pupils to be given greater exposure to providers of technical education, so they know about alternatives to a traditional academic route. Under legislation that came into force at the start of the year, schools will be required to give all pupils in years 8 to 13 at least six opportunities to meet a range of providers of technical education, including apprenticeships, T-levels and higher technical qualifications. Robert Halfon, the minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said good careers advice was vital to open up opportunities for young people from all backgrounds and create the future workforce the UK needed. “The changes we are making to boost our careers programme will raise ambitions from an early age for thousands of children in primary schools across the country, while providing opportunities to unlock talent, think about skills, engage with employers and discover different workplaces.” Oli de Botton, a former headteacher who is chief executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company, which will coordinate the primary careers programme, said: “Our new primary programme will bring careers inspiration to children early in their school life by connecting them with role models and showing them how different subjects relate to jobs.” The education charity Teach First will help train primary school teachers in disadvantaged areas where the scheme will be introduced. Dominic Wyse, a professor of early childhood and primary education at University College London’s Institute of Education, said the initiative’s success would depend on how well it was delivered. “It does worry me it could be terribly dull. There’s a real question – will it motivate children, will it motivate teachers, and is it the sort of push that’s needed right now?” Sarah Hannafin, a senior policy adviser for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), whose members mainly work in the primary sector, said it was right that careers education should not be left to secondary schools. However, she added: “All schools must be provided with the resources they need to provide high-quality careers education, but current provision remains underfunded. Schools will find it challenging to meet increasing requirements and expectations with no additional resources to deliver them.”",Children as young as five in England target of new careers programme,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/05/children-young-five-england-urged-think-about-careers

The Business Department announced that a Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure that vital public services will have to maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike. Minimum safety levels will be set for fire, ambulance and rail services and the Government said it will consult on the “adequate level of coverage” for these sectors. The announcement was made amid a wave of strikes, including a walkout by train drivers on Thursday which crippled rail services. Unions reacted with fury to the move, saying it would do nothing to resolve the disputes breaking out across the country every week. Business Secretary Grant Shapps said: “We hugely value the work of our public services and we’re reaching out to unions to have an honest conversation on pay, conditions and reform. “Industrial action is disruptive for everyone – from people relying on essential services to get to work or care for their family to hard-working business owners whose sales suffer. It also costs those striking at a time when family budgets are tight. “As well as protecting the freedom to strike, the Government must also protect life and livelihoods. While we hope that voluntary agreements can continue to be made in most cases, introducing minimum safety levels – the minimum levels of service we expect to be provided – will restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption.” The Government said it will invite unions to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about what is fair and affordable in public sector pay settlements for 2023/24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged industrial action. A statement said: “Ministers are reaching out to unions to invite them to sit down and discuss the evidence that the Government will be submitting to the pay review bodies – and hopes that unions will also share their evidence. “If the offer is accepted, discussions will take place between government departments and unions in the coming weeks on issues including pay evidence, workload and conditions in the public sector. “These discussions will help ensure the evidence submitted to the pay review bodies is as considered and informed as possible, including reflecting areas of common ground. “The Government is clear that the well-established independent pay review process is the right way to set public sector pay – it provides independent, expert advice and is a neutral process in which all parties play a role. “These new discussions would feed into this process and are offered as the Government recognises the particular economic challenges the country faces this year.” The Government called on the unions to cancel upcoming strikes in a bid to resolve the disputes “constructively through dialogue”. “However, the Government also has a duty to the public to ensure their safety, protect their access to vital public services, and help them go about their daily lives,” the statement said. “The Government will always protect the ability to strike, but it must be balanced with the public’s right to life and livelihoods. “That’s why the Government will introduce new laws to ensure a basic level of service in some of our most crucial sectors when industrial action takes place.” Gary Smith, GMB general secretary, said: “A Government that has presided over 13 years of failure in our public services is now seeking to scapegoat the NHS staff and ambulance workers who do so much to care for the people of our country. “The NHS can only function with the goodwill of its incredible staff and attacking their fundamental right to take action will alienate them even further and do nothing to help patients and the public. “We are always ready to discuss our members’ pay but the Government is refusing to talk about problems as they exist now, instead they want to kick the can down the road. “There are huge questions over the NHS Pay Review Body, as ministers’ actions have consistently undermined its independence. The process needs real reform and our members need a much stronger commitment than we heard today.” The announcement said unions would be bound to follow the legislation and would risk employers bringing an injunction to prevent strikes from taking place or seeking damages if they did not comply. RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: “Curtailing workers’ freedom to participate in lawful industrial action is always undemocratic and we will look closely at what the Government releases. “We will meet with ministers to see their evidence for the pay process. However, only negotiations on our dispute can avert the planned action this month and I urge the Prime Minister to show a renewed sense of urgency, grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses without further delay. “As for minimum staffing, last month’s action was safe for patients because of detailed discussions we chose to initiate with the NHS to protect emergency services and life-saving care. The public respected that and even ministers acknowledged our constructive approach. “Safe staffing levels that are set in law are what we want to see year-round not just in these extreme circumstances. “We’ve long campaigned for governments to be accountable for safe and effective staffing levels in NHS and social care to prevent one nurse being left with 15, 20 or even 25 sick patients. “The evidence is unequivocal – safe staffing saves lives and having the right number of registered nurses on duty has a direct impact on the safety and quality of patient care. Today’s highly unsafe situation is what is driving our members to say ‘enough is enough’.” Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect said: “This hollow invitation ignores the fact that a majority of public sector workers are not covered by a pay review body, including nearly all civil servants. We have been calling for years for this to be rectified, something which the Government has consistently ignored. “These workers have been some of the most harshly treated over the past decade of real-terms pay cuts, and now the Government is signalling its intent to leave them out once again. “Our members have already indicated their willingness to take industrial action and there is nothing in this announcement that will persuade us not to proceed to a formal ballot as planned.” Unison’s assistant general secretary Jon Richards said: “Ministers should focus their time and energy on rebuilding trust and relationships with workers, not silencing and suppressing them. “Minimum staffing levels in the NHS would be welcome by the public and health staff every single day of the week. That could avoid people being left lying in agony on A&E floors or dying in the backs of ambulances. “The NHS is on its knees because of record vacancies. The idea of limiting legal staffing levels to strike days and threatening to sack or fine health workers at such a time shows proper patient care isn’t ministers’ priority. “The Government is picking ill-advised fights with NHS employees and unions to mask years of dismal failure to tackle pay and staffing.” TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “This is an attack on the right to strike. It’s an attack on working people, and it’s an attack on one of our longstanding British liberties. “It means that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don’t. That’s wrong, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal. “The announcement offers nothing more to help with this year’s pay and the cost-of-living crisis. “The only offer of talks is for next year. But we need to resolve the current disputes and boost the pay of public sector workers now. “The Prime Minister said yesterday his door is always open – if he’s serious, he should prove it. He should take up my offer to get around the table to improve this year’s pay and end the current disputes. “There is a world of difference between promises of jam tomorrow with technical discussions about pay review bodies, and proper negotiations on pay in the here and now. “Our public services are already deep in a staffing crisis. But this Government has gone from clapping key workers to threating them with the sack if they take lawful action for a pay rise. It will only push more people away from essential jobs in public services, harming the whole nation.” Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said: “Just when you thought the Government could go no lower, ministers say they’re looking to deal with strikes by making them illegal, rather than negotiate with unions. “PCS members are on strike because they cannot afford the cost of living. We view any attempt to outlaw strikes as an attack on the trade union movement and we will resist that at every stage.” Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said: “This is an empty offer from the Tory government, and a meaningless stunt from Grant Shapps. “Firefighters and other key workers are facing a ‘real-terms’ pay cut, against a backdrop of rising food and fuel prices during the cost-of-living crisis. “Nothing in this statement from Grant Shapps seeks to address the ‘in work’ poverty faced by these workers who kept our public services going during the pandemic. “They were the Covid heroes. “This grandstanding from Grant Shapps is badly misjudging the public mood. “The Government should call off all pay cuts and we’ll call off strikes. “Grant Shapps should stop telling workers to accept falling real wages.” Claire Sullivan, director of employer relations and union services at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Imposing new anti-strike legislation in a country which already has some of the most onerous strike laws in Europe is unnecessary, weak and unworkable. “The Government is well aware that the proposed ‘voluntary agreements’ in the NHS are already in place due to health workers’ commitment to providing ‘critical to life’ cover. “The way for the Government to avoid current and future workplace disputes is through ongoing, meaningful dialogue and by working in partnership with trade unions. The CSP and other health unions have been warning of the developing NHS crisis for a decade and calling for urgent pay talks for several months, only to be met repeatedly by a complete block from Government.”",Government pressing ahead with ‘minimum safety levels’ legislation,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/unions-government-grant-shapps-nhs-prime-minister-b2256705.html

The official government forecasts from HM Treasury show a fall in UK economic output (gross domestic product, GDP) of 0.8 per cent in 2023. The Scottish Fiscal Commission are predicting a 1.2 per cent fall in Scottish economic output. There are no official forecasts for the Highland economy but it is very likely that the GDP performance will be even worse, with probably a fall of about 1.5 per cent. The reasons for that include the greater importance of the tourism industry. Inflation in 2023 is forecast to be about five per cent. That implies an annual fall in personal incomes of about 6.5 per cent in the Highlands. That means another substantial reduction in personal spending, which will have serious negative implications for local shops and other businesses. Looking further ahead, 2024 will almost certainly be better but there can be little doubt that 2023 will be another bad year for the local economy. The world economy had a very bad 2022 because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and an inflation rate exceeding 10 per cent. The huge increase in oil and gas prices has badly affected the output of many industries and also consumer spending. There is little expectation of an improvement until later in 2023, as the above forecasts show. The Highlands have a diversified economy, dominated by the service sector, including tourism in normal years. The manufacturing sector is relatively small but includes important industries such as offshore oil and gas production, renewable energy, Scotch whisky and fish processing. Public sector employment has held up well, because of the importance of bodies such as the Highland Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, NatureScot and the Crofting Commission. However, all their budgets have been under severe pressure and that will continue during 2023. Tourism is very important for many parts of the Highlands. It had a very bad 2022 and unfortunately there are few signs of a significant improvement in 2023. There were big falls in visitor numbers last year because of the various Covid restrictions, which resulted in similar falls in revenue for local hotels, B&Bs and many local shops. Hopefully there will be a revival during 2023. Some industries have done surprisingly well, such as Scotch whisky. New distilleries and expansions are currently under construction in various parts of the Highlands. It is a very strange time for the energy industry in the Highlands, including offshore oil and gas, wind farms and other renewables. Oil and gas production is declining steadily but the recent huge increases in world oil and gas prices have helped existing fields and will possibly lead to a few new developments, despite environmental opposition. In contrast, there has been disappointing progress with renewable energy developments and there are few reasons to expect 2023 to be better. A few local businesses, notably Global Energy at Nigg, are doing very well from wind farm contracts but the overall growth has been much less than predicted. The fishing industry should have a better year because of recent international agreements on fish catches. It and the local fish farms have also benefitted from the rises in consumer prices. Most other local businesses have been badly affected by the huge rises in energy prices. However, world oil and gas prices have fallen significantly in recent weeks. Consumer confidence is low and I expect that to continue during the first half of 2023 at least. The lower consumer spending will have negative impacts for shops and other service sector businesses. More closures seem inevitable. There can be little doubt that the first half of 2023 will be another bad time for the Highland economy. I hope there will be a big improvement during the second half of the year but the current indications are not promising. Tony Mackay is an Inverness-based economist.

Morris Leslie, the company behind the West Kinfauns plans, won planning permission in principle in August. 2022? The proposal is for a four-star, four-storey hotel as well as holiday lodges, transport museum and shops. Cafes, restaurants, bakeries and a cycle repair shops could also form part of the development, which could create up to 130 full-time jobs. Next steps in Perthshire leisure hub Morris Leslie’s group operations director Graham Ogilvie has revealed the next steps for the development. Reflecting on a year of progress, he said: “2022 has all been about getting the consent. 2023 is working through the consent and splitting the development into different parts. “The lodges will be the first part of the development. We will progress with the applying for detailed consent and then construction will commence. “This is something we will do ourselves. In the past 18 months we have created our first holiday park at Alyth. This would also be done under the Morris Leslie Villages banner. “It will be around 50 lodges on site. This part of the project alone would be an investment of around £10 million.” Hotel operator sought Morris Leslie is best known for hiring construction equipment, but also has auction and property interests. It also has its headquarters on the site it acquired from Edrington in 2019. However, the company is not going to be a hotel operator. Armed with the outline planning permission from Perth and Kinross Council it will be marketing the hotel opportunity. “There have been discussions with operators that are ongoing,” Mr Ogilvie said. “Getting the brand is the easier bit, it’s the funding and development of the construction project where there are negotiations and discussions ongoing. “I’d like to think we’ll have an operator on board in 12 months’ time.” He warns that the quoted £33.8 million cost is likely to be far higher due to inflation. “The build costs from when we started the project to where we are now have moved significantly but room rates for hotels have moved higher as well,” he said. The park and ride facility, museum and retail elements of the project are likely to come at the later stages of the development. Neighbouring the site is a new 15-home development by Ogilvie Homes who won permission on appeal to the Scottish Government. Morris Leslie hopes around 80,000 people a year could be attracted to the site, boosting the local economy by £4m.

Comment No one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are The dysfunctional rail system can only be fixed if rail pensions are also sorted out John Ralfe 6 January 2023 • 9:35am 350,000 people are part of the Railways Pension Scheme Credit: Jacob King/PA Wire New Year, new rail strikes, new chaos for rail passengers. Although unions have been locked in a bitter dispute with government and rail companies for months, over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions, we haven’t heard much about pensions. Perhaps this is because no one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are? Pensions for train operating company staff are still based on final salary, and most still have a retirement age of 60. Even public sector pensions are now based on career average salaries, with a higher retirement age. The average salary for a train driver with 10-20 years experience is reported to be £55,000, so a driver retiring at 60 with 30 years pension would get an average inflation-linked pension of £22,000, plus a £33,000 cash lump sum. Train company accounts show the annual cost of new pension promises is around 60pc of salary – a huge part of overall pay – even after employee contributions. Rail pensions have a unique “cost sharing” arrangement, with all regular and deficit cash contributions split 60/40 between employers and employees, which may explain the reluctance to increase annual cash contributions. Each train operating company is part of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), set up at privatisation in 1994. It is an industry-wide scheme with over 100 legally separate sections, including Network Rail, and freight, engineering and maintenance companies. At privatisation, all pensioners and deferred members were transferred to a new section with a “crown guarantee” underwritten by taxpayers. RPS is one of the UK’s largest pension schemes, with £37bn of assets at December 2021, and 350,000 members, including 100,000 current employees. Each RPS section has a three-year valuation but the December 2016 valuation for train operating companies have still not been agreed with the Pensions Regulator, way, way beyond the legal deadline. Although the established rail franchising rules mean train operating companies must pay cash contributions over the life of a franchise, they have no liability for a deficit when the franchise ends. The deficit is simply passed on to the next company taking over the franchise, in a game of pass-the-parcel. If no one is prepared to take on the franchise, it reverts to the Government. The latest accounts for each of the train operating companies show the combined pension deficit is around £8bn. We know the effective re-nationalisation of the train operators in 2020 means all the industry’s annual losses are paid by taxpayers. But re-nationalisation also means taxpayers are on the hook for the pension deficit, which has been hidden from taxpayers. The dysfunctional rail system can only be sorted out if rail pensions are also sorted out. Despite the threat of further strikes, this means closing the expensive and risky defined benefit pension and moving to defined contribution. The good news for rail staff is that some of the cost savings can be used to increase monthly pay. Defined contributions would still leave the £8bn deficit to be paid, partly through higher fares, but with taxpayers left picking up most of the bill.

The British Medical Association (BMA) warned of three days of further disruption for the NHS if health secretary Steve Barclay continues to refuse to negotiate over pay demands. It comes ahead of a ballot opening on 9 January, when 45,000 junior doctors in England will be asked whether they want to strike in the row over pay. The BMA claimed that Mr Barclay was making attempts to find a negotiated settlement impossible by ignoring “all calls and letters” despite the prospect of strike action. “Pay erosion, exhaustion and despair are forcing junior doctors out of the NHS, pushing waiting lists even higher as patients suffer needlessly,” said Dr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Robert Laurenson, co-chairs of the BMA junior doctors committee. They added: “The government’s refusal to address fifteen years of pay erosion has given junior doctors no choice but to ballot for industrial action. If the government won’t fight for our health service, then we will.” The union said successive governments have overseen 15 years of real-term pay cuts for junior doctors, saying it amounted to a “staggering and unjustifiable” 26.1 per cent decline in pay since 2008-09. But the government has awarded only a 2 per cent pay rise for junior doctors, and Mr Barclay has continued to point to the recommendation of the independent pay review body as a reason to avoid negotiations. The BMA said it was “particularly galling” to see Rishi Sunak and his ministers refer to the pay review body. “The reality is that the doctors’ pay review body has been constrained by political interference for more than a decade,” said the union’s co-chairs. The prospect of fresh NHS disruption comes as ambulance staff prepare to walk out on 11 and 23 January, while nurses will strike again for two consecutive days on 18 and 19 January. The government has vowed to press ahead with plans to introduce new legislation to enforce “minimum safety levels” in the NHS and five other key sectors during industrial action. Health unions reacted with fury to the move, saying it would do nothing to resolve the disputes breaking out across the country. The Royal College of Nursing, GMB and Unison – leading the walks-outs planned for nurses and ambulance staff later in January – also vowed to opposed “desperate” anti-strike legislation. The government also urged union leaders to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about public sector pay settlements for 2023-24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged strikes. But unions bosses said ministers must engage on pay demands for the current year, with the GMB health union accusing the government of trying to “kick the can down the road”. The BMA and other health bodies have warned of an “exodus” of NHS staff as industrial dispute rumbles on. Four in ten (40 per cent) of junior doctors plan to leave the health service as soon as they can find another role, a survey carried out by the BMA last month found. Low pay and poor working conditions were the main reasons cited for wanting to leave, with the union warning that the NHS “would not be able to cope” without two-fifths of its junior doctor workforce. It comes after Mr Barclay appeared to blame high numbers of flu, Covid and Strep A cases for the particular pressures the NHS faced over Christmas – a claim refuted by health leaders who pointed to long-term struggles.

The latest S&P Global/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI), closely watched by the housebuilding sector, scored 48.8 in December, down from 50.4 in November. Any score below 50 indicates that construction sector output has shrunk, and December’s score marks the first contraction since August. It also came in broadly in line with the consensus, with analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics predicting PMI would fall to around 48.5. The sector has suffered the knock-on effects of a slowing housing market, with mortgages becoming more expensive for home buyers resulting in fewer house sales, economists said. Yet construction firms continue to face higher inflation, pushing up the cost of raw materials and transportation, and the looming threat of a recession. As a result, builders are feeling downbeat about the future of their businesses, the survey revealed. December saw confidence among businesses in the outlook for the year drop into negative territory for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and for only the sixth time on record. Dr John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: “The construction sector was stuck in the mud in December with the steepest fall in activity since the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020 and a similarly fast drop in pipelines of new work. “Housebuilding saw a notable change of direction, with a mix of higher inflation for raw materials and transportation and the squeeze on affordability rates for mortgages resulting in fewer house sales.” The commercial sector marked a “bright spot” in the survey, with activity growing fractionally, with a score of 50.3. But it was offset by contractions across the residential and civil engineering sectors in December. Dr Glen added: “Civil engineering, responsible for larger projects, continued to be the weakest performer again, with a sixth month in the doldrums as uncertainty about the UK economy reared its ugly head again and customers hesitated.” Furthermore, the survey suggests that builders are reining back on recruitment amid a hesitancy to spend too much when the future of the economy is uncertain. Employment fell below a score of 50 for the first time since January 2021, with weak sales meaning that vacancies are often not being filled, the survey indicated. Dr Glen said: “Builders are fast running out of the resilient spirit maintained over the last couple of years as the blocks to success piled up and the winter of discontent with high inflation, strikes and shortages continues.” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The construction sector managed to keep its head above water through the autumn, but now is being dragged down by the recession in the wider economy and the surge in borrowing costs faced by households and businesses.” But he pointed out that a drop in activity in December may have been partially driven by some builders “downing tools” during the week of heavy snow across parts of the UK.",Builders deflated as construction sector shrinks,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/builders-deflated-as-construction-sector-shrinks-b2257249.html

Speaking on a visit to a school in Battersea, south-west London, the Prime Minister said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday.” Pressed whether the talks would include discussions on this year’s pay, the Prime Minister did not rule this out, saying: “What we have said is we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation with all union leaders about what is responsible, what is reasonable, and what is affordable for our country when it comes to pay. “I’m hopeful that those talks can be constructive and we can find a way through this.” Asked whether he could meet the nursing union’s demands “halfway” after it suggested a pay rise of ten per cent rather than nearly double, the PM added: “We have always been clear that we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation, a two way conversation with union leaders.” The Standard understands that the move is a new approach by the Government, with Cabinet ministers, not the PM, meeting the unions that their departments work with, and that the Government aims to talk about pay deals for 2023/24 rather than this year. However, the stand-off between the Government and unions has escalated after ministers proposed bringing in legislation to force some sectors such as health and transport to continue delivering a “minimum service” during industrial action. Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation. Asked a second time whether people could be sacked for not going to work under the new law, the premier said: ""I fully believe in the unions' role in our society and the freedom for them to strike. ""I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption. ""That's why we're going to bring forward new laws, in common with countries like France, Italy, Spain and others, that ensure that we have minimum levels of safety in critical areas like fire, like ambulance, so that even when strikes are going on you know that your health will be protected. ""I think that's entirely reasonable and that's what our new laws will do."" Labour has said it would repeal the “minimum service” laws, if they are passed before the General Election, and if it wins the poll expected next year. Britain is being hit by a wave of strikes including by rail workers, nurses, paramedics, postal workers, border staff and civil servants.","Rishi Sunak invites all union leaders for ‘grown-up, honest’ talks on Monday in bid to end strikes",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/strikes-rishi-sunak-unions-talks-rail-nurses-b1051247.html

The Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure vital public services maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike. Minimum safety levels will be set for fire, ambulance and rail services and the Government said it will consult on the “adequate level of coverage”. Speaking from the picket line at Euston station on Friday, Mr Lynch told BBC Breakfast that the Government is trying to “close down” the unions with the new legislation. “What this is a symbol of is that the Government are losing the argument,” he said. “They’ve lost the argument on austerity and pay, and the state of our national public services. “And instead they want to close that argument down by closing down the unions and stopping us from campaigning against poverty.” He said the Bill is a threat to sack union members if they refuse to go to work. “What they are saying is that they will sack our members if they don’t go to work,” he said. “They are going to conscript our members. “We have to name who will go to work, and if those members in a lawful manner don’t want to cross our picket line they can be dismissed individually and the union can be fined. “So we will have to see what the law says.” It comes as services have been crippled by the walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) at Network Rail and 14 train operators on Friday. The action will last for 48 hours and follows a stoppage on Thursday by train drivers in the Aslef union which caused widespread disruption. Only around 20% of normal services are running on Friday and trains will finish earlier. The strike ends a week of industrial action on the railways, with the dispute remaining deadlocked. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a school in south-west London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had invited union leaders for what he hopes will be a “grown-up” conversation on Monday about what is affordable. The Prime Minister was asked if proposed legislation could see nurses sacked for striking, and if it was his ambition to go further and make some more strikes in critical services illegal. Mr Sunak said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday. “We incredibly value the important work that our public sector workers do, especially our nurses, and we want to have an honest, grown-up conversation about what’s affordable, what’s responsible for the country. “Those invitations have gone out and I’m hopeful that those meetings can happen on Monday so we can have a productive conversation and find a way through this.” Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation.

As many projects were pushed back last year, the beginning of 2023 will be marked by a steady pipeline of work. However, this optimism will be short-lived. Recessionary forces will strike and work is expected to tail off at the back end of 2023. No one feels confident. It is a nervous period to operate as a business, and the sector must stay alert. For the housing market, demand is falling amidst the cost of living crisis, job insecurity and the recession. Declining property prices should stabilise by Spring 2023 yet only those not bound to the difficulties of securing a mortgage or with sufficient savings will be able to afford the luxury of entering the property ladder. The government could help stimulate demand in the housing market by introducing a reduced stamp duty rate for first-time buyers and those wanting to downsize to a smaller property. Confidence in the market will return, but it will take time. Ultimately while the best-run construction companies will survive, partly due to their inherent financial strength, others, including good contractors who may be dependent on third parties, will unfortunately fail.

In all, occupiers from a wide range of business sectors have taken a combined total of 120,000 sq ft at Malton’s premier employment park. Sean Harrison, managing director of Harrison Developments said: “These new deals are a tremendous vindication of the substantial investment we have made in our park. “More than 350 new and sustainable jobs have been created on site, which makes us very proud. The wide variety of successful businesses here is also an indication of the strength of the economy in the Ryedale area. Bella di Notte (Image: Press release) “We are especially pleased that successful Yorkshire businesses such as Bella di Notte and Dales The Chef’s Choice have moved into larger premises on our park, because they like the location and the ambience so much. We have been delighted to accommodate their needs, as they have outgrown their current buildings. “These are not the easiest of times, as we emerge from a global pandemic into a worrying cost of living crisis, but the current level of activity at our park gives us confidence for the future,” said Mr Harrison. Luke Counter, owner of the multi-award-winning Counter Interiors, which now occupies a new 1,500 sq ft mezzanine showroom, said: “I can’t speak highly enough of the Malton Enterprise Park, which is the perfect base for us. The flexibility of the mezzanine unit which we occupy means that we now have an extensive showroom, storeroom and offices. “We are based in Clifton in York, but quite a few of our customers are from the Malton and Ryedale area, so it made sense for us to open another showroom here. The location, just by the A64, is ideal, with easy access to the rest of the county. The whole park looks magnificent, which creates the perfect atmosphere for businesses here to flourish.” Meanwhile Bella di Notte, the popular women’s fashion retailer, which originally moved to the Malton Enterprise Park four years ago, has recently taken extra space to accommodate its growth.

Just this week, Amazon said it was axing 18,000 workers, or 6% of its office staff, while business software firm Salesforce said it would reduce its workforce by 10%, or roughly 8,000 people. That followed announcements from dozens of other firms including big names such as Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, hardware heavyweight Cisco, and payments firm Stripe. Despite the belt-tightening seen in Silicon Valley, the world's largest economy soldiers on. Employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, according to the latest official figures. Although that was slower than gains seen in 2021, when activity roared back to life after the pandemic, it was still strong by most standards. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, returning to historic lows. The economy is widely predicted to slow in the coming months as rising prices weigh on consumer spending. Firms are also grappling with higher borrowing costs after the US central bank hiked rates rapidly last year. So are the cuts in the tech industry a warning sign for others? ""I don't think people should be worried,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. ""What we're seeing right now seems to be... a correction, not the start of an ominous, systematic recession."" Many tech executives making the announcements have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic, when more activity moved online and business boomed. Funding for smaller start-ups has also dried up due to higher interest rates and the sharp downturn in the US stock market in 2022. Big hits some firms have taken from the meltdown in the crypto sector have not helped the mood either. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM, said the wave of tech cuts represented a ""necessary and expected"" adjustment after a generation of rapid growth, fuelled in part by low interest rates, which culminated in the pandemic frenzy. ""An era of excess has come to an end,"" he said. ""Firms and individuals should be prepared to reset expectations about growth, employment and investment across what continues to be a very solid industry."" He suggested that tech firms will no longer be insulated from ups and downs in the wider economy, including the expected downturns in Europe and the UK this year. But he added that the job losses should not be ""over-interpreted"", noting that many of the workers affected, at least in the US, appear to be finding new jobs quickly. The latest jobs report from the Labor Department showed that payrolls in the information sector - which includes much of the tech industry - shrank by just 5,000 from November to December. That's despite thousands of job cuts being announced in recent months and compared to a year ago, employment is up. ""It's probably a canary in the coal mine for the global economy more than it is for the American economy,"" he added, noting that many of the tech cuts have hit foreign staff. Last week, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that a third of the world would likely be in recession in 2023. That will hurt tech firms, many of which do big business overseas. But for now, the US labour market has remained unexpectedly resilient, making some hopeful that the country will be able to fend off a harsh downturn, despite the central bank raising interest rates to try to cool the economy and price rises. Nearly every sector in the US economy added jobs last month, with bars and restaurants, health care firms and construction businesses helping to drive the gains. Although job losses are rising - especially in sectors vulnerable to higher interest rates like housing, banking and tech - the figures overall remained near historic lows last year, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has been tracking such announcements since the 1990s. ""We are seeing the labour market cooling,"" he says. ""It's a slowdown but I don't think I could say at this point whether or not it's a panic situation."" Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, said he worries many of the layoff announcements reflect peer pressure, as executives feel compelled to copy other firms making cuts - even as they continue to churn out healthy profits. If that sentiment spreads, as he expects, it risks turning the forecasts of economic hardship into reality. ""Companies do what other companies do,"" he said. ""This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because if everybody lays somebody off, the unemployment rate will go up and we will in fact have a worse economy.""",Are tech job cuts a warning for the wider economy?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64189106?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Rebecca Morelle,85546280,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F74F/production/_128211336_virgin-orbit-88.jpg,en,2023-01-07 04:12:22,-0.019,GB,"The first-ever orbital rocket launch from British soil is set to blast off on Monday, marking the start of the UK's race to space. The ambition is to turn the country into a global player in space - from manufacturing satellites, to building rockets and creating new spaceports. But can the UK carve out a place in an increasingly crowded market - and why try to reach for the stars? ""We are the guinea pigs,"" says Melissa Thorpe. ""It is the first time any of us have done this, so it's been quite a learning experience."" Melissa is in charge of Spaceport Cornwall, which is about to attempt its very first foray into space. She's showing me around their base at Newquay Airport. There's all the usual hubbub of activity: passengers arriving, suitcases being loaded, planes being fuelled. But there's also something more surprising on the tarmac: a 21m-long rocket. A team is busy prepping it for the first ever launch from UK soil that will take satellites into orbit around the Earth. But this is a blast off with a difference. There won't be a vertical launch from the ground. Instead, the rocket is fixed underneath the wing of a modified jumbo jet. Once the plane is mid-air, the rocket will be released and fire its engines to head into space. Setting up the UK's first spaceport has taken years and a lot of hard work, plus an entirely new regulatory framework to ensure these launches are safe. The hope is it will make a difference to the local area, one of the poorest in the UK, by bringing in new companies and creating new jobs. ""I think it's the next chapter for Cornwall,"" Melissa says. ""We were at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. We're not new to pioneering technologies."" But there's a wider ambition too. If this succeeds, it should help to position the UK as a leading place for space. However, this isn't the first attempt at creating a British launch industry. A white and red rocket, nicknamed ""the lipstick"", was supposed to be the start of something big for the UK. It blasted off in 1971, sending a satellite into space. The programme was called Black Arrow, and this was the first British-built rocket to deliver a British-built satellite into orbit - although it took off from Australia. But the costs were deemed too high by the government, so that first launch turned out to be the last. The UK's launch industry hit a long pause after this, but another aspect did take off in Britain - satellite building. And this has helped to drive a thriving space sector, which, according to a recent government report, is worth £16.5bn a year to the UK economy and employs nearly 50,000 people. ""We absolutely knock it out of the park when it comes to small satellite manufacture,"" says Dr Alice Bunn, CEO of UKSpace, the trade association of British space companies. Until now, she says, satellites built in the UK have had to be shipped abroad to get into space, but this first launch will change that. And it comes at a time when satellites have become integral to our lives - although Alice says most people are unaware of how dependent we are on this technology. ""Think about satellite navigation systems, environmental monitoring, emergency response - let alone all the telecommunications capability - that we can provide from space. It really is a running thread through our lives,"" she says. And some companies have big plans with this technology. The Cardiff-based company Space Forge thinks a whole host of new materials can be made in orbit. In a cleanroom, one of their small satellites is being painstakingly prepared for its journey. It's one of nine being sent into space by the Cornwall launch. Space Forge describe their shoe box-sized satellites as mini factories. ""In space, with the absence of gravity, you can mix together any different materials you want,"" says Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bacon. ""So if you take the whole periodic table, and start putting things together - like lead, aluminium, rubidium, einsteinium - there are billions of new alloys that you can now make that you couldn't make on Earth."" The new materials could be used in electric vehicles, green technology or computing, he explains. And he thinks there are some big advantages to launching these satellites close to their Welsh base. ''The fact that we can just drive down the road for a couple hours to get to our spaceport is a huge impact,"" Andrew says. But it's not just Cornwall racing to space. Amidst the bleakly beautiful undulating hills and jagged cliffs of the Shetland island of Unst, there's a hive of activity as diggers and dumper trucks come and go. The team here is celebrating because an important milestone has been reached. The concrete is setting on their first launch pad, one of three planned at the site. The SaxaVord Spaceport is being constructed on a peninsula jutting out into the sea, at the northernmost tip of the UK. ""I think the first response from the locals was that maybe it was an April Fool or something like that,"" says Debbie Strang, SaxaVord's chief operating officer. ""And then, as they've seen the progress and the development, there's been real excitement about what we've been doing."" There's a good reason why they've chosen such a remote place, where sheep and Shetland ponies outnumber the inhabitants. ""It's the safety element for us,"" says Debbie. ""What we're doing needs to be as far away as possible from population centres, so that when the rocket leaves, there's no real danger to people nearby."" SaxaVord is aiming for the UK's first vertical rocket launch to take satellites into orbit, with up to 30 launches a year once it's fully up and running. It's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland. Others are planned in Sutherland in the Highlands and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. The hope is that these could all boost local economies, and that's especially important in Unst. ""This island's suffered quite badly from depopulation over the last 20 or 30 years,"" explains Scott Hammond, the deputy CEO of SaxaVord. ""There was a small airfield here that used to be the third busiest heliport in the UK. And then they also had an RAF station here. ""When that left, it halved the population of the island and it clearly had a massive economic impact."" He hopes the spaceport could give the island a boost. ""We'll have more and more service jobs, during the fuelling of the rockets, for example, putting the liquid oxygen into the rockets. And those of course, will be highly paid, highly skilled jobs."" But if you're building a launchpad, you also need rockets - and SaxaVord is working with several companies looking to use Unst to blast off. One of these is Skyrora, based in Cumbernauld, just outside of Glasgow. Inside their vast hanger, the team is busy working on different rocket parts, from nose cones, to engines and containers for propellants. The company is making smaller prototypes, before building a larger rocket, Skyrora XL, that they plan to eventually launch from the Shetland Islands. ""You do a full design on paper and then you start building it. You build prototypes, you do tests, you go back to the drawing board and see what needs to be fixed,"" says Ahsan Zaman. He's just finished his aerospace degree, and says the new push for space in the UK is opening up opportunities for science and engineering graduates. He's proud to be working on the project. ""If we're successful, then we'll forever be known as the first people to do it in the UK. So yeah, it is an honour as well as exciting."" While the launch industry is just starting to come together in the UK, it's much better established in other parts of the world. And one company in particular now dominates the market: Elon Musk's SpaceX. With their reusable rockets, the company has massively cut the price of sending satellites into space. Can the raft of small new rocket companies compete? Skyrora's CEO Volodymyr Levykin says he wants his rockets to offer a more bespoke service. ""We want to be like a satellite taxi service,"" he explains. ""To launch whenever the customer wants us to launch and deliver them to an exact position they need to be in orbit."" He thinks because more and more small satellites are being built, the market to launch them will grow - but not every company will make it. ""Some of us, of course, will fail,"" he says. ""But there are some who are believers in this emerging market. And we decided to invest earlier rather than later, to be ready when the market actually will start to boom."" The UK government says it wants to push the space sector, and is investing in research and development. But UKSpace's Alice Bunn says the support needs to be long term. ""You will not become a global space player by investing in research and development alone. There has to be some kind of government commitment to ongoing operational capability."" She says this could mean the government signing up as a customer for launches, for example. ""We need to think a little bit creatively, industry and government working together, just to get us off the ground here."" All eyes are now on Cornwall, waiting for the first UK launch to blast off. It will be just the start for this new industry and there will be many challenges ahead. But as the well-known mantra goes, space is hard - and anyone working in this sector knows this. The hope is that with this high risk, comes the possibility of sky-high rewards. Follow Rebecca on Twitter.

In a sign of the scale of the problems facing the NHS, Rishi Sunak will spend Saturday focusing on how to ease the pressure on frontline services. But Mr Sunak has been warned that the rare weekend meeting is unlikely to reverse the NHS’ fortunes, which have been blamed on “years of inaction”. Senior doctors say the NHS is on a knife edge, with many A&E units struggling to keep up with demand and trusts and ambulance services declaring critical incidents. Discharge rates fell to a new low in England last week, with only a third of those patients ready to be released from hospital actually leaving. Mr Sunak, during a visit to a school on Friday, said he recognised that the NHS was “under enormous pressure”. No 10’s NHS Recovery Forum will see the Prime Minister hold talks with health experts about how to improve performance. Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Treasury minister John Glen, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden and the chief executive officer of NHS England Amanda Pritchard are also set to attend. The focus will be on four crucial issues: social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care, and primary care. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there were “no silver bullets” to solving the crisis currently being experienced at hospitals and other care centres. “This crisis has been a decade or more in the making and we are now paying the high price for years of inaction and managed decline,” said Mr Taylor. “Patients are experiencing delays that we haven’t seen for years. “High levels of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rising Covid levels are exacerbating the problem but the cause is decades of under-investment in staffing, capital and the lack of a long-term solution to the capacity-crunch facing social care. “None of these problems can be solved tomorrow.” The Prime Minister, in his first speech of 2023 on Wednesday, made reducing NHS waiting lists one of his key pledges before the next election, which is due to take place before 2025. Saturday’s Downing Street forum is expected to last most of the day. As well as ministers, attendees will include chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations, local areas and councils from across the country. Clinical experts from Royal Colleges and independent sector organisations working with health and social care services to deliver services for patients are also expected to join the Prime Minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “As the Prime Minister made clear this week, easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS is one of his key promises. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting branded the meeting a “talking shop”. The senior Labour figure said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor, a former Labour and Tony Blair aide, agreed with the criticism, saying the investment to improve discharge rates came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. He added: “Indeed, some local systems are still awaiting their allocation. “Any similar funding next year must be provided four to six months in advance so it can genuinely ease winter pressures.” On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet with union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year. However, Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen has told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” over the current settlement to prevent planned strikes. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll, of course, go to the meeting and make the case for nursing in all forums, but it’s sadly not what’s going to prevent strike action that’s planned for 10 days’ time. “I have put out an olive branch to get us to the table, I’m asking the Prime Minister now to meet the RCN halfway. The ball is firmly in the Prime Minister’s court.” A Department of Health and Social Care source said the Health Secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”.",Sunak to hold emergency No 10 talks in bid to ease winter care crisis,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/steve-barclay-matthew-taylor-nhs-wes-streeting-prime-minister-b2257731.html

The prime minister told health and social care leaders during an emergency summit in Downing Street on Saturday that it was a “collective responsibility” to free up hospital beds and slash ambulance waiting times. But Ms Cullen said his pledge will fail unless he gives her members a pay rise. She warned Mr Sunak the public would back nurses over the government if any were sacked as part of a new anti-strike crackdown and claimed the upcoming nurses’ walkout will be the biggest strike of its kind in the world. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Cullen also challenged the “out of touch” prime minister and health secretary Steve Barclay to work a 14-hour shift in a crisis-hit emergency ward. She said Mr Sunak could end the strikes this week if he takes up her offer to meet in the middle on pay, after saying she was willing to discuss a raise of 10 per cent instead of the 19 per cent originally asked for. During the crunch summit to solve the chaos engulfing English hospitals, Mr Sunak warned health leaders “business-as-usual mindset won’t fix the challenges we face”. England’s chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty and NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard were among those summoned for the rare weekend meeting. The prime minister is understood to be looking at ideas including the use of technology to help people stay out of hospital and increasing the number of “virtual wards”. He also highlighted that a small number of NHS trusts were responsible for a large proportion of serious issues, including long ambulance waits and waiting times for cancer care. Downing Street has said it will publish recovery plans to improve ambulance and A&E waiting times “in the coming weeks”. As Mr Sunak battles to bring the current crisis under control, Ms Cullen urged him to understand the scale of the upcoming nurses’ strike. A 48-hour walkout in England from 18 January will involve more hospitals than similar strikes last month’s action. She said: “We balloted around 320,000 nursing staff and my understanding is it has been the largest ballot of nursing staff in the world and it is the largest nursing strike in the world. We’ve also increased the number of organisations [such as NHS Trusts]. There are now 70 involved. First time around it was 46.” She also revealed that she had received messages of support from senior politicians in several European countries. December’s strikes were headline news in France, Italy, Spain and Austria among others. The world was “watching in dismay”, Ms Cullen said. She urged Mr Sunak to learn from the experience of other international leaders who were forced to back down in the face of ward walkouts, including Irish prime ministers in the first decade of this century. “What this government should look to is how the leader of [Ireland] stepped in very quickly and did not allow both of those strikes to go beyond the first few days,” she said. “And took immediate action. And that was because the public pressure was enormous.” On Wednesday, Mr Sunak set out his vision for the NHS, including a personal pledge to cut waiting lists. But he was criticised for offering nothing to end the current crisis or the strikes, which will also see ambulance staff take action later this month. “He made a broad, bold statement that he was going to cut waiting lists, but he won’t unless he addresses the crisis in nursing ... and the only way you are going to do that is to address the fundamental issue of nurses’ pay,” Ms Cullen said. Strike action will have to escalate if the government continues to ignore nurses, she said, although no decisions have yet been taken on what that would look like. Ms Cullen added: “He could bring it to a resolution this coming week – and avert industrial action. I will make myself available any night or any day. Let’s get round a table. Let’s have a discussion. “I think they owe that to the profession, to all those 320,000 nurses. And they owe it to every patient in this country, particularly those 7.2 million sitting on waiting lists year on year, to get around a table.” On Friday Mr Sunak refused to rule out that nurses could be sacked as part of his new crackdown, swerving the question in a broadcast interview. She described “any suggestion that they would sack any nurse… simply because nurses are standing up for their patients and the NHS” as “disheartening” given that there were currently 47,000 vacancies in the UK. Describing the prime minister as “out of touch” with the realities of the current crisis, she challenged Mr Sunak and his health secretary to work a 14-hour shift in an emergency department. She said: “From 7am to late into the evening, when a number of those hours will be unpaid, when the nurses should be off shift and home but they have no one to hand their patients on to. “They need to just walk in the shoes of those nurses for a few of those shifts. And I think that would make better decisions.” Leaving the NHS Recovery Forum on Saturday, consultant physician James Dunbar told reporters he was “confident that action will be taken” to address the crisis – but not optimistic it would be dealt with before spring. “These are difficult problems to fix though, so I think it’s unlikely we’ll have it sorted by the end of this winter,” he said. Dr Dunbar said that “a lot of” senior clinical leaders taking part were “saying the same thing”, adding: “The prime minister seemed to understand that.” Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Adrian Boyle meanwhile said the crisis is “fixable” and welcomed emergency care being “recognised as a priority”. A Downing Street spokesperson said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she added. A Department of Health and Social Care source said the health secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”. A government spokesperson said: “The health and social care secretary wants to have an honest conversation with unions, including the RCN, about what is affordable in pay settlements for next year during these challenging times, and is keen to meet for discussions as soon as possible. “We have accepted the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in full and have given over 1 million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. This is on top of a 3 per cent pay increase last year when public sector pay was frozen and wider government support with the cost of living.”",Rishi Sunak warned waiting list pledge will fail without NHS pay rise as he calls for ‘radical’ action,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/pat-cullen-nurses-rcn-strikes-b2257639.html

Here, we speak to just three of them. Volunteers at a vital community foodbank say that demand is surging with low-paid workers increasing reliant on it to make ends meet, writes Russell Blackstock. The facility at St Gregory’s Catholic Church, in Wyndford, Glasgow, is staffed entirely by unpaid helpers and is open five days a week. Unlike other foodbanks, St Gregory’s does not require users to provide a referral from an agency. It distributes free bags comprising up to 20 items including cereal, pasta, canned soup, tuna, tinned fruit, long-life milk and eggs. Toiletries, washing powder and washing-up liquid are also available. Co-ordinator Eileen Low said the number of people seeking help had soared by more than 30% since the pandemic’s peak while in the week before Christmas volunteers distributed a record number of bags. “We have just had our biggest ever week with 219 basic bags being handed out to help more than 500 individuals and families,” she said. “It is a grim new record to end the year with for us.” Low said that the foodbank’s clientele had also changed since the cost of living crisis started to bite this winter and many more working families were now seeking help. “When we started out five years ago, we were distributing between 30 and 40 bags weekly and it was usually to the most vulnerable people such as refugees, single pensioners and those with mental health or addiction issues,” she explained. “But now we are seeing more and more parents who have low-paid jobs such as cleaners and hospitality workers coming to us for help because they can’t pay the bills and feed their kids at the same time. “The working poor is a growing sector in our area and the government seems unable to do something constructive about it, so that’s where community-based charities come in. We are another safety net for people who are struggling financially and the authorities seem happy to let the likes of us pick up the slack. “It is obscene that this is happening in this day in age. At times we feel as though we are providing a new frontline service.” Ingrid Mitchell, who lives locally, has been volunteering at St Gregory’s for the past three years. She helps to shop for staples and hands out and delivers bags to foodbank users. The mother of two is a senior cabin crew member with a large airline, serving meals and drinks to passengers on transatlantic routes. She has been shocked by the surge in families seeking assistance from the foodbank. She said: “Many people feel embarrassed to ask for help but some have no other choice and they now rely on us. I have always been community minded and it is awful to see ordinary people in this situation. Sadly, I can’t see this crisis easing any time soon.” ‘We are warm and can offer a respite to what is going on’ No longer just a place to borrow books or study for exams, libraries are introducing a range of activities, clubs and groups to create “warm and welcoming spaces” that people can utilise during the cost of living crisis, writes Alice Hinds. From movie matinees and craft groups to mindful colouring-in sessions for adults and regular coffee mornings, library leaders say such innovative services provide a vital lifeline for people in the community who would otherwise struggle to find warm, comfortable and, importantly, free places to spend time during winter months. Ray Pattie, library adviser at Edinburgh Central Library, says the centres have always provided support for communities but new groups have become increasingly popular for people who may feel isolated or worried about spending money while socialising. “Our users see libraries as safe and reliable spaces,” he explained. “People just don’t have the disposable income now for sitting in Costa for hours and hours – that can turn into an expensive week, so they are looking for other things to do outside of the home. “That’s why we’re providing things like Knit And Natter, a weekly craft group, and adult colouring-in sessions, too. “The activities give people an opportunity to still come out and spend time with other people in a warm space but it’s more affordable than visiting a cafe. It’s an opportunity to meet new people as well. Since I’ve worked in libraries, it has very much been all about the community.” As well as introducing social groups, many of the Scottish capital’s libraries have also added social spaces to encourage people to visit for as long as they like. Replicating a living room with plants, comfortable seating, warm lighting and coffee tables, the areas also have free-to-use jigsaws and board games and a number of libraries have also included self-help guides on topics such as energy and money saving, and cooking on a budget. Hana Mackechnie, lifelong learning service manager for libraries in Edinburgh, said: “Some of our libraries are open 52 hours a week and you don’t need to come for a particular reason. “We’re finding that people want a space where they can spend a little bit longer, and somewhere they can also find signposting to benefits they might be entitled to, or get advice on how to access particular services. If you are a reader, you probably already feel like you’re welcome in a library but there’s so much more going on and we’re trying to introduce more activities.” Every weekday during winter, libraries across Edinburgh are also hosting movie matinees with free teas, coffees and refreshments, giving people another way to keep warm for a few hours. Acting library supervisor Natasha Gibson added: “We were already providing or about to introduce these initiatives but the situation now has brought more of a need for them and highlighted just how valuable they are for the community. “People are becoming more aware that, yes, libraries are also a place to come and be social and have a few minutes of respite from whatever is going on in life. “People do come to the library specifically to chat to people or get a change of scenery and at the moment it’s a much-needed place away from home that’s warm – both in terms of the physical surroundings and the people that are here.” ‘It is sad to see so many people struggling’ Demand for free furniture, school uniforms and even haircuts is on the rise at a community-based initiative in south-west Scotland, writes Russell Blackstock. The Furniture Project in Stranraer was originally set up to recycle, repair and provide refurbished household goods at affordable prices. But the charity, which has more than 20 volunteers and runs two shops, has also turned to providing household items and services for free to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. “We started running Freebie Friday events that are proving to be hugely popular,” said boss Paul Smith. “These include giving away items like furniture and household appliances and demand has been high. “So many low-income workers who wouldn’t normally be struggling are now coming to us because the price of everything has risen so much that they simply can’t make ends meet. “I suppose we are doing what the likes of parish organisations and local authorities might have done in the past.” Other popular services provided by the charity include organising free school uniforms and haircuts for children whose parents are struggling to get by. “A new school blazer alone can cost between £40 and £50 and if you have three kids in the house, that is a big expense for any family,” said Smith. “People can come to our shop and discreetly get a school uniform for nothing, and we run this service all through the school year. We have also started a project involving local hairdressers so that kids can get haircuts for free because, again, this can be expensive if you have a number of children in the house. “We try to help to make sure that these kids don’t feel any different from friends at school who come from better-off backgrounds. “It is sad to see so many people struggling financially at the moment but I grew up on a housing scheme that was regarded as being poor and we had to put up with hand-me-downs, so I know what that is like.” The organisation also recycles bicycles and gifts that would usually go to landfill, and sells them cheaply to people once they have been refurbished. Also, it provides a mentoring service that enables retired people to pass on skills and knowledge to youngsters so that they can find jobs in areas such as warehousing and customer services. Smith said even middle-income families were now using the project to inexpensively replace big-ticket household items such as fridges, cookers and furniture as the cost of living crisis deepens. He added: “Previously, you could almost categorise those using services like ours as being among the most vulnerable in our community but the financial pressures are now adding up for people right across the board. “We are now increasingly helping the sort of folk that we normally wouldn’t expect to see.”","Community foodbank: In this day and age, it is obscene we are so needed as a safety net for people",https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/foodbanks-warmbanks/

Being the prime minister, he must have thought, has to amount to more than acknowledging a terrifying array of looming crises. When asked what you hope to do with your time in office, you’ve got to give a more inspiring answer than “cope”, even if you’re fortunate in following a leader who didn’t even manage that. What would be a clear, constructive, positive, yet achievable, initiative? Nothing fun at this bleak time – any whiff of levity could be accused of trivialising people’s suffering. And nothing that sounds expensive. Also nothing that sounds too leftwing, what with the Tory right calling Sunak a socialist for failing to cut taxes. But nothing that sounds too rightwing either, what with the Labour party being so far ahead in the polls. Plus there are many subject areas to avoid: health, transport, defence, the economy… Probably best if it doesn’t touch on any other countries, what with Brexit being such a sore point and China getting horribler and Russia obviously. And there’s the whole illegal immigration shitstorm, so maybe steer clear of abroad altogether. Also food and fuel and housing would be good areas not to mention. Plus it shouldn’t be something that sounds difficult or people won’t believe it’s going to happen. And it shouldn’t be anything that anyone cares too much about because, its achievability notwithstanding, it still probably won’t happen. What should it be? I’d have been stumped. My best idea was: “Every hard-working family will be given a free cactus.” They could sit on kitchen tables, as symbols of bristly resilience, while people try to work out how to pay the mortgages on their freezing homes. Little green shoots of spiny recovery sprouting all over an economic wasteland. Sunak went another way. He fell back on something he could rely on, the solace of many a swot in the face of moral complexity, myself included: maths. You know where you are with maths. Maths doesn’t let you down. Maths doesn’t go on strike, or arrive uninvited on the south coast, or die because it couldn’t get an ambulance, or send bullying texts, or appear on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. Let’s do more maths! That was his new initiative. Everyone should be studying maths until the age of 18, he declared. Who can argue with that? Eight million adults in the UK are only numerate to primary school level. That’s bad. But brilliantly, all those potential voters, who presumably hate maths, won’t have to do any at all, but only agree with the principle that they should have done more previously. No one who can vote will have to do anything they don’t want to. This is an entirely inoffensive policy. The education secretary, who my investigations tell me is called Gillian Keegan, might feel aggrieved that it doesn’t leave her with much to say in her next speech. Michael Gove used to have great fun with that brief – handing out bibles and making everyone read Thomas Hardy and memorise dates – and even Gavin Williamson got to cancel everyone’s exams. The importance of maths should be something Keegan gets to bang on about to easy applause, but the PM has nicked it because every single other policy area has gone toxic. But he was determined to make it sound massive: “This is personal for me,” it was reported that he was “expected to say” in his speech. And he did! “It’s the single most important reason why I came into politics: to give every child the highest possible standard of education.” Wow – it turns out he’s a stealth educationist. He was also expected to say: “Just half of all 16-19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills is letting our children down.” Admirable sentiments, though the phrase “our children’s jobs” raises the spectre of child labour. An unfortunate slip when families are struggling to afford food and fuel and the sick are left untreated. It’s all getting a bit Dickensian. But perhaps it’s deliberate. Is this heritage austerity? Back to when Britain was great? Perhaps by “studying maths” he means “doing data entry”? Good work for children with their nimble fingers, and much safer than picking fluff out of an industrial loom, so we must count our blessings. It was a slip because, of all the things he was “expected to say”, the phrase about “children’s jobs” was the only one he didn’t. Very wise. Bless him, he just wanted to say “children” as many times as possible. A focus group must have generated that finding: saying “children” is a good look for him. Better than for Truss the malfunctioning robot or Johnson the philanderer, who just kept having children. Sunak’s children look nice – he’s shared some lovely photos – it’s a relatable family unit. Keep saying “children”, Rishi, and people will believe you care. I approve of the maths plan, but it’s such a tiny thought. In most countries that we increasingly laughably consider our equivalents, maths up to the age of 18 has long been compulsory. Rather than having an idea, he’s just picked one of myriad ways in which Britain is worse than elsewhere and resolved to correct it. It’s like saying: “We really ought to start brushing our teeth.” A small, long-overdue correction to our educational practices coming from the leader of a party that’s been in power for 12 years. It’s lame. And it won’t happen. Sunak says he “will work with the sector to move towards all children studying some form of maths to 18”. “Work with” to “move towards”. Christ. Don’t hold your breath. As Keegan’s shadow, Bridget Phillipson, put it: “He cannot deliver this reheated, empty pledge without more maths teachers, yet the government has missed their target for new maths teachers year after year.” More teachers requires more money. The money must either be raised or moved from elsewhere. That means fewer missiles or nurses or tax cuts or more taxes. Perhaps maths will let him down after all.",More maths?

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and Aslef took industrial action which crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Union leaders will meet rail minister Huw Merriman as they continue to insist the Government is blocking a deal to end the long-running row over pay, jobs and conditions. Transport Secretary Mark Harper denies the allegation, saying he is facilitating talks between unions and employers. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Today I want to see the Government stop play-acting because the truth, written in black and white in their rail contracts, is that they’ve been in complete control of this dispute from day one. “The train operators cannot move without Government say-so. “Passengers, workers and businesses are suffering and even rail company managers are beginning to break ranks in despair at the Government’s approach. “The minister cannot hide behind this fairy story that he is just a facilitator. “His Government can end this dispute today by taking out the conditions they put in to torpedo a resolution and let the companies make a deal.” Meanwhile, Aslef leaders will consider an offer – made on Friday by the Rail Delivery Group on behalf of train operators – of a 4% pay rise for last year and 4% this year. Conditions were attached to the offer, such as speeding up the training of drivers, as well as over Sunday working arrangements. Rail union and industry officials will give evidence to the Transport Select Committee on Wednesday. A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The Transport Secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. “They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. “Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation and costing every household an extra £1,000.”",Union leaders to meet rail minister in bid to secure deal to end strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-mark-harper-mick-lynch-huw-merriman-rmt-b2258343.html

Last year was chaotic for domestic politics, with upheaval at Westminster and long-running argument at Holyrood on the constitution. Here are just five of the big problems and promises you want sorted for 2023. 1. Fix the NHS NHS Grampian took the desperate step of putting out an urgent social media appeal for staff off-duty or on holiday to come in to work over the festive period. And NHS Highland has warned Raigmore and Belford Hospitals are “very busy” and expressed concerns over a surge in flu patients. Patients across the north and north-east have also struggled to access their GP with one Aberdeen doctor revealing he is seeing three times the safe number of patients “on an almost-daily basis”. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf is facing mounting pressure to come forward with a recovery plan. He says Covid backlogs, rising cases of flu and Strep A, delayed discharged and cold weather are “all compounding” the usual pressures on the health service. The SNP minister is expected to deliver a statement addressing concerns at Holyrood on Tuesday. Meanwhile, NHS Grampian is waiting for an extra £7 million a year required to help more Moray women give birth in Elgin. Campaigners in Caithness continue to raise concerns over the lack of women’s healthcare in the county, with women facing 100-mile journeys to Inverness for treatment. 2. Will the A9 and A96 be dualled? It was confirmed just days before Christmas that a final decision on fully dualling the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness will not be made until well into next year. The SNP promised over a decade ago to dual the route by 2030. But this was thrown into doubt when the Scottish Greens were brought into government in 2021. An open survey of P&J readers, published on January 6, revealed the vast majority of respondents want the A96 dualled all the way. A project to dual the A9 between Inverness and Perth has also been hit by serious delays but the government has yet to give an update on its 2025 target completion date. Pressure on the SNP Government is intensifying after 13 people died on the stretch due to be dualled between the two cities. 3. We need better ferries Furious islanders from the Hebrides to Shetland have warned locals are packing up and quitting their communities in response to the “utterly chaotic” ferry system. The construction of two new ferries, MV Glen Sannox and Hull 802, is well behind schedule and over budget. The vessels, which were originally commissioned in 2015 from struggling shipyard Fergus Marine, are now years late and over a hundred million pounds over budget. The Holyrood inquiry continues but already the SNP is promising more. 4. Whatever happened to Freeports? Three locations across the north-east, Highlands and islands are vying for “green freeport” status from the UK and Scottish governments. Freeports get special tax status and are being promoted as job-creating goldmines. Others fear they are light on regulation and attractive to money launderers. A joint bid by Aberdeen and Peterhead ports is going up against bids by Cromarty Firth and Orkney for the two coveted spots. But bidders have been left in the dark since the summer over who will secure the special tax status, with Scottish Secretary Alister Jack admitting months ago that a decision has already been made. It is understood the ever-changing leadership of the Tory party delayed the announcement last year. 5. What is the future for oil and gas? The SNP conference in October seemed to finally push the future of oil and gas workers to the top of the agenda. Taking place in Aberdeen, Ms Sturgeon said her government has a “duty” to support workers into new green jobs. But there has been a lack of detail on the practicalities. Energy Secretary Michael Matheson is slated to deliver a statement on Scotland’s long-awaited energy strategy and “just transition” plan on Tuesday. The latter will focus on the offshore workforce, Mr Matheson told the Press and Journal last year. Energy policy is reserved to the UK Government and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will have a key role in charting the future of the oil and gas sector, from the licensing of future oil fields to the windfall tax.",5 problems people across the north of Scotland want politicians to fix in 2023,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/5243446/nhs-freeports-a9-a96-oil-gas-ferries/

The deck machinery specialist – based at Towie Barclay Works, near Turriff – is enjoying growth in the offshore floating wind market. Our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Alfie Cheyne, founder and chairman, Ace Winches. Growing demand in energy markets in both North America and the Middle East are also driving the business forward, it said. Ace Winches, whose many accolades over the years include prestigious Queen’s Awards in 2010 and 2013, has formed a subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates as part of its global growth strategy. And earlier this year it announced the opening of a subsidiary in Houston, Texas. Underlying earnings up 38% Chairman Alfie Cheyne said a strong financial performance during the 12 months to March 31 last year was a foundation “which bodes well for the future”. The company reported pre-tax profits of £4.5 million – down from £7.8m for the previous year, when results were boosted by the reversal of a £4.8m write-down. Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation raced ahead to £7.6m last year, up by 38% from £5.5m previously. Ownership tussle The most recent figure excludes one-off costs associated with a change of ownership, Turnover increased slightly to £28.3m, up from just shy of £28m the year before. Ace Winches’ 58-year-old chairman founded the business in 1992 but lost control of it to Balmoral Group in stages between 2017 and 2019. The relationship with Aberdeen-based Balmoral eventually turned sour and Mr Cheyne and his wife, Valerie, reacquired the firm in late 2021. Reflecting on 2021-22, Mr Cheyne said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. “It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is.” He added: “In this reporting period we have made an additional investment of £1.3m in our rental fleet in line with our twin objectives of diversification and geographic expansion. “It has been a year marked by significant growth and change – growth in the renewables market and a change in how we interact with our customers. “This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet, thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Green ambitions Mr Cheyne also highlighted the firm’s green credentials after it became carbon neutral. Operations at Towie Barclay Works are now powered by wind. On the firm’s wider green ambitions, chief commercial officer Gary Wilson said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East are indicators of our strategy going forward.” With more than 3,000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, Ace Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and other services in multiple sectors. Headcount averaged 155 during the 12 months to March 2022, down from 171 the year before. Mrs Cheyne, chief compliance officer, said the company was growing its workforce again. She added: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our graduate engineer numbers, providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.”",Ace Winches sets sights on global growth after &#8216;strong&#8217; results,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/local/5245423/ace-winches-sets-sights-on-global-growth-after-strong-results/

Earlier, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “happy to talk about pay” with unions as ministers held a series of meetings aimed at ending a wave of industrial unrest in the NHS and on the rail network. However, both the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” Unite said any suggestion that a one-off pay reward could be made in exchange for a boost in productivity was “absolutely ludicrous”. While other trade unions said that “progress” had been made, there was no sign that enough had been made for planned strikes to be called off. Unite negotiator Onay Kasab, speaking after a meeting with Mr Barclay, accused the Government of telling staff they would need to “justify” a payment through productivity. “This isn’t a factory we’re talking about, we’re talking about people who are working well beyond their contracted hours anyway just to get the job done because they care so much. “So, for the Government to be talking about productivity in exchange for a (payment) is an insult to every single one of our members.” Mr Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. Alongside talks with health unions, teaching unions were holding talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan ahead of announcements this week over whether their members will go on strike. Rail minister Huw Merriman called in train workers after sustained action crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Mr Kasab said: “I emphasise the thing to get out of today that is absolutely clear is that they want our members to give more in order for it to consider a payment. That is absolutely outrageous.” He said there had been no “detailed” discussion of what a pay settlement might look like, adding that the talks had left him “very angry”. He added: “The Government have missed yet another opportunity. We came here in good faith.” After the meeting, the GMB said that ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday, adding that the talks “fell well short” of anything needed to stop the walk-out. More than 10,000 GMB members are expected by the trade union to take to picket lines on Wednesday. “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis,” said Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary. “The public expects the Government to treat these talks seriously – it’s time they got on with it.” Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, told reporters that “progress” had been made but said there had been no “tangible” concessions. “It was a very civil meeting. We did actually manage to talk about pay – we didn’t get the tangible concessions that we might have hoped for that would enable us to call off the strikes later this week. “But it was definitely progress when you’re in a room with the Secretary of State talking about pay, I think. “He’s asked for our help to help with the Treasury to make the case for investment. We’ll certainly do that.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks. Elaine Sparkes, assistant director at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Although the meeting was more constructive this time, there is nothing tangible on the table. “As such, we’ll be announcing the first of our strike dates later this week as we continue to push for a fairer deal for our members and their colleagues.” The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement. On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”. “On pay, we’ve always said that the Government is happy to talk about pay demands and pay issues that are anchored in what’s reasonable, what’s responsible, what’s affordable for the country.” Downing Street earlier warned that concerns about inflation had not gone away as the Government prepares for the next round of pay talks for 2023/24. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Government was open to listening to trade unions’ concerns. “We are happy to listen to the pressures they think they are under, what they think is fair, responsible and affordable, and likewise we will provide detail about what we think is affordable, and also the challenge that inflation poses to all of this as well.” Elsewhere, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch dodged questions about progress in rail talks but said that further discussions would take place. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, gave a shrugging gesture as he left the Department for Transport but also declined to give any detail of the meeting. The National Education Union said that “no concrete progress” had been made in its talks with the education secretary. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “While there is the thought of further meetings, there is no sense of concrete progress as yet. There is no offer, there is no change. “There are further discussions to happen that we will engage in while still urging our members to vote in the ballot.” Mr Courtney added: “There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action because we think these meetings are only happening because of the threat of industrial action.” Business Secretary Grant Shapps has said ministers were seeking a more “collaborative approach”, telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “It is a new year. We are very keen to see these strikes come to a conclusion. We want to see a collaborative approach.”",Strikes set to go ahead after ‘insulting’ talks with Health Secretary,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/strikes-set-to-go-ahead-after-insulting-talks-with-health-secretary-b2258736.html

On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”. “On pay, we’ve always said that the Government is happy to talk about pay demands and pay issues that are anchored in what’s reasonable, what’s responsible, what’s affordable for the country.” Downing Street earlier warned that concerns about inflation had not gone away as the Government prepares for the next round of pay talks for 2023/24. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Government was open to listening to trade unions’ concerns. “We are happy to listen to the pressures they think they are under, what they think is fair, responsible and affordable, and likewise we will provide detail about what we think is affordable, and also the challenge that inflation poses to all of this as well.” Elsewhere, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch dodged questions about progress in rail talks but said that further discussions would take place. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, gave a shrugging gesture as he left the Department for Transport but also declined to give any detail of the meeting. The National Education Union said that “no concrete progress” had been made in its talks with the education secretary. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “While there is the thought of further meetings, there is no sense of concrete progress as yet. There is no offer, there is no change. “There are further discussions to happen that we will engage in while still urging our members to vote in the ballot.” Mr Courtney added: “There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action because we think these meetings are only happening because of the threat of industrial action.” Business Secretary Grant Shapps has said ministers were seeking a more “collaborative approach”, telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “It is a new year. We are very keen to see these strikes come to a conclusion. We want to see a collaborative approach.”",Strikes set to go ahead after ‘insulting’ talks with Health Secretary,https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/strikes-set-to-go-ahead-after-insulting-talks-with-health-secretary-b1051771.html

The company, which earlier this year announced the opening of ACE Winches Inc. in Houston, Texas, reported a pre-tax profit of £4.5m, while there was also a slight increase in turnover to £28.3m. ACE Winches Chairman Alfie Cheyne, who, in 2021, returned to the organisation he founded, said the performance gives the company a strong platform to build from. He said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. ""It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is. ""In this reporting period we have made an additional investment of £1.3m in our rental fleet in line with our twin objectives of diversification and geographic expansion. “It has been a year marked by significant growth and change – growth in the renewables market and a change in how we interact with our customers. ""This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success. “We have a long tradition of focusing on the environment, and I am proud to say we reached our goal to be carbon neutral in this past year, with operations at our headquarters having been conducted using wind power.” Chief Financial Officer Alastair Scott added: “The increase in EBITDA excluded one-off costs associated with change of ownership in November 2021, while the figures for the year to March 2021 have also been restated to reverse the effects of a previous financial impairment which is no longer required. “The positive EBITDA results demonstrate the success of the business strategy and allow continued investment into the rental fleet.” Valerie Cheyne, Chief Compliance Officer, said: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our Graduate Engineer numbers providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.” Increasing demand for safe high-quality products and operational delivery in North America and the Middle East has propelled the company’s international strategy and operational activities, which are expected to further strengthen the group’s financial results in 2022/23. As part of that ambition, ACE has formed a subsidiary company in the United Arab Emirates, ensuring the range of high-quality services from concept design through to manufacture, equipment rental and further support, is delivered globally. Chief Commercial Officer Gary Wilson​ said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East, are indicators of our strategy going forward, as we place a focus on areas of opportunity where our capabilities and solutions single us out as a contractor of choice. “We have a strong reputation that has been built up through our commitment to innovation and investing in our people and services over the last 30 years, and we are looking forward to bringing that expertise to more of our customers in North America and the Middle East, as well as markets we already serve.” With more than 3000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, ACE Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and deploying solutions across multiple sectors.

The Jamesfield development is a joint venture with Harmony Energy, following TagEnergy’s acquisition of a 60% stake in the project in November 2021. It will use a system of Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries, together with Tesla’s Autobidder software for real-time trading and control. It is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter this year, with renewable energy company RES as asset manager. Franck Woitiez, chief executive of TagEnergy, said the company's third battery energy storage facility in the UK reinforced its commitment to the country and its green energy goals. “This is another important milestone in TagEnergy’s growth in the UK as we leverage our strong storage expertise to support the UK grid and propel the nation to net-zero carbon emissions by connecting more competitive renewable power. “We are excited to enter this next phase in the project in partnership with Harmony Energy and with the support of Santander UK as we grow our UK footprint to accelerate the energy transition.” Mark Cumbo, director of specialised and project finance at Santander UK, said: “This follows the funding we provided TagEnergy in 2021 to support Hawkers Hill Energy Park in Dorset, and to TagEnergy and Harmony Energy in 2022 for Chapel Farm near Luton. “Santander UK strongly supports clients such as TagEnergy and Harmony Energy that are bringing additional capacity to enable greater contribution from renewables to the UK’s energy sector.” Peter Kavanagh, chief executive of Harmony Energy, said: “We have been working on this site for over four years and are delighted to be progressing to this next stage with TagEnergy, following our partnership which was announced in 2021. “Securing debt funding from Santander UK demonstrates a growing appetite from institutions to support battery developments and we look forward to working with it.” Jamesfield is the third TagEnergy investment in battery storage facilities in the UK to reach financial close following its entry into the UK market in 2021. Commissioning of its first project, Hawkers Hill Energy Park, took place in September and construction of its second project, Chapel Farm, started last February. Jamesfield, Chapel Farm and Hawkers Hill, together with previously-announced projects Roaring Hill in Fife, Lakeside in North Yorkshire and more recently, Pitkevy in Scotland, take TagEnergy’s secured portfolio in the UK to date to 320MW/640MWh. TagEnergy partnered with Balance Power in October to build, own, and operate 500MW of Balance Power’s renewable energy pipeline requiring an investment of more than £300m over the next four years. Since its formation in 2019, TagEnergy has assembled a portfolio of close to 4GW based on solar, wind and battery storage technologies in the UK, Portugal, Spain, France and Australia.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Mr Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. The Health Secretary suggested that improvements in efficiency and productivity could “unlock additional funding” for the 2023/24 pay settlement, but unions want workers paid more now, raising the possibility of a one-off lump sum to help with the soaring cost of living. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down.

The source said talk about productivity and efficiency improvements had been linked to the 2023/24 pay settlement, rather than a one-off payment. In the Commons, Mr Barclay told MPs: “It is right that we are engaging with the trade unions, I was pleased to meet the staff council of the NHS today and indeed the chair of the NHS Staff Council, Sara Gorton, said the discussions had made progress. “Notwithstanding one trade union leader who wasn’t in the talks giving an interview outside the department to comment on what had and had not been said in those talks, but we want to work constructively with the trade unions on that.” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. An ally of Mr Barclay said the issue of a one-off payment was raised at the meeting by the unions, rather than the Health Secretary, who “listened to what he had to say and agreed to take it away”.

It follows recent articles on inflation, energy, food and the cost of living. Canada: assertive unions getting results Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Canada’s trade union movement is among the more resilient in the OECD, the club of developed countries. This is related to laws that prevent “free riding”, which is where workers can benefit from collective agreements without being union members. Union density in Canada has been around 30% of workers since the turn of the century, although membership in the private sector is barely half that and slowly falling. In contrast, unionisation is high in public services (over 75%) and growing. This relatively stability has left Canadian workers better prepared to confront the impact of inflation on their wages. Unions made higher wage demands than in recent decades, and more frequently went on strike (continuing a trend from 2021). From January to October 2022, there were 145 strikes, and the final year tally will likely exceed the 161 in 2021 – itself a marked increase. A total of 1.9 million person-days of work were lost in strikes up to October (the highest in 15 years). Unlike in recent years, the majority were in the private sector. A spring wave of strikes in construction in Ontario (Canada’s most populous province) symbolised the increased militancy. At peak, over 40,000 workers downed tools for higher wages, including carpenters, dry-wallers and engineers. Tentative agreements reached by officials were sometimes rejected by members, prolonging the strikes. A second historic flash point came later in the year when Ontario’s right-wing government invoked a rarely used constitutional clause to override the right to strike for 55,000 education support workers. After unions in the public and private sector threatened a province-wide general strike, the government backed down. Meanwhile, employer lockouts have virtually disappeared. This tactic, in which employers suspend operations until workers agree to terms being offered, had only been used eight times by October, compared to 60 per year a decade ago. Annual wage growth increased modestly to an average of 5% by late in the year. That still lagged the 6.8% inflation, but closed the gap from 2021. It remains to be seen whether this union pressure can be sustained in the face of rapid interest rate increases, a likely recession in 2023, and continued government suppression of union rights in some provinces. United Kingdom: an olive branch for the health service? Phil Tomlinson, Professor of Industrial Strategy, University of Bath The UK’s latest winter of discontent is extending into 2023 as the country endures its largest wave of strikes in over 30 years. Most are in the public sector, where pay offers are well below inflation and significantly lag private companies. The sense of grievance is high following the austerity and real-terms pay cuts of the 2010s. Strikes – estimated to have cost the UK economy £1.7 billion in 2022 – are being co-ordinated across different unions, adding to the public inconvenience. The UK government has steadfastly refused to yield, however. It has hidden behind independent recommendations by public-sector pay review bodies, despite not always following them. They have also claimed that inflation matching public sector pay rises would cost each UK household an extra £1,000 a year, though this figure has been debunked. The Treasury also echoes Bank of England concerns about setting off a wage-price spiral. Yet this is unlikely, given the current inflation is largely down to supply shocks (from COVID and the war in Ukraine), while average wage growth is well below inflation. There is an economic case for a generous deal, especially in the National Health Service (NHS): with over 133,000 unfilled vacancies, better wages might help improve staff retention and recruitment. Of course, funding this in a recession involves tough choices. Higher taxes would be politically difficult with the tax burden at a 70-year high. Higher government borrowing could aggravate inflation if accommodated by the Bank of England increasing the money supply through more quantitative easing. Public opinion appears largely sympathetic to the strikes, especially in the NHS. But if the government relents in one sector, it sets a precedent for others, with potentially wider economic consequences. For the NHS, it may instead bring forward public sector pay review body negotiations for 2023 to allow for an improved deal – possibly alongside a one-off hardship payment. Elsewhere it will probably hold firm and hope the trade unions lose their resolve. Australia and New Zealand: strikes remain rare despite inflation Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Strikes in Australia have become very rare in recent decades, thanks to restrictive labour laws passed since the 1990s. Despite historically low unemployment and wages lagging far behind inflation, these laws continue to short-circuit most industrial action. In 2022, union density fell to 12.5% of employees, an all-time low. As recently as 1990, union density was over 50% of workers. Union members can legally strike only after negotiations, ballots and specific plans for action have been publicly divulged (thus fully revealing union strategy to the employer). Even when there are strikes, they tend to be short. A total of 182 industrial disputes occurred in the year to September. (The statistics don’t distinguish between strikes and employer lockouts, which have become common in Australia.) This is similar to the pre-COVID years, following a drop in 2020, and only a fraction of 1970s and 1980s industrial action. The only visible increase in strike action in 2022 was a series of one-day protest strikes organised by teachers and health care workers in New South Wales, the country’s most populous state. Having put up with a decade of austere wage caps by the conservative state government, they decided they had had enough as inflation picked up. Most other workers have been passive despite Australia experiencing among the slowest wage growth of any major industrial country. Nominal wages grew just 2% per year over the decade to 2021. That rose to 3.1% by late 2022, but it’s still less than half the 7.3% inflation rate. Australia’s newly elected Labor government did pass a series of important labour law reforms at the end of 2022, aimed at strengthening collective bargaining and wage growth. That might herald incremental improvement in workers’ bargaining power in the years ahead. The industrial relations outlook in New Zealand is somewhat more hospitable for workers and their unions. Union density increased in 2021, to 17% of employees (from 14% in 2020). Average ordinary hourly earnings grew an impressive 7.4% in the latest 12-month period – helped by a 6% boost in the minimum wage by New Zealand’s Labour government. Industrial action remains rare – perhaps in part because workers are successfully lifting wages via other means. No official strike data is available for 2022, but in 2021, just 20 work stoppages occurred, down sharply from an average of 140 per year in the previous three years. Indonesia: anger against labour law reforms Nabiyla Risfa Izzati, Lecturer of Labour Law, Universitas Gadjah Mada A few weeks ago, the government replaced its controversial “omnibus law” with new emergency regulation. This was in response to the Indonesian constitutional court finding it unconstitutional in 2021. Passed in late 2020, the omnibus law embodies President Joko Widodo’s ambition to attract foreign investors by slashing red tape at the cost of employees’ rights. It made it easier for businesses to lay off employees without prior notice. It also lowered statutory severance pay and extended the maximum length of temporary contracts, while ignoring worker safety. In 2022, its new formula to determine the minimum wage also resulted in the lowest annual increase ever. The law attracted much criticism from workers, activists and civil society organisations. The new emergency regulation is arguably even more problematic. The majority of its provision simply copies the omnibus law. Several changes and additional provisions are confusing and overlap with previous regulations, as well as leaving many loopholes that could be exploited in future. Yet despite complaints from workers and trade unions that the new rules were passed suddenly and without consultation, strike action is out of the question. Strikes are not popular because they can only be organised with permission from the company in question. If labourers hold informal strikes, employers also entitled to get rid of them. Public protests are the obvious alternative, though pandemic rules restricting mobility and mass gatherings have made these difficult. Nevetheless, thousands or perhaps even millions of workers staged protests in their respective cities in the second half of 2022. The workers wanted the omnibus law revoked, and for the government to not use the minimum wage formulations stipulated in the law. The demonstrations got more intense as the government raised subsidised fuel prices in September, which boosted already high inflation due to rising food prices. The government has since issued a separate regulation to determine the 2023 minimum wage, so the demands were successful, although both workers and employers are furious that the minimum wage rules have changed again under the emergency regulation. Clearly the protesters did not see the rest of the rules in the omnibus law removed. Some workers have been protesting on social media. This might not induce the government to change the law, but a few viral tweets have pushed several businesses to change abusive practices. The controversy is likely to continue in 2023 and into the election year of 2024, especially amid possible massive layoffs in the midst of a global recession. United States: worker protest showing signs of life Marick Masters, Professor of Business and Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Wayne State University US workers organised and took to the picket line in increased numbers in 2022 to demand better pay and working conditions, leading to optimism among labour leaders and advocates that they’re witnessing a turnaround in labour’s sagging fortunes. Teachers, journalists and baristas were among tens of thousands of workers who went on strike. And it took an act of Congress to prevent 115,000 railroad employees from walking out as well. In total, there have been at least 20 major work stoppages involving upwards of 1,000 workers each in 2022, up from 16 in 2021, plus hundreds more that were smaller. Workers at Starbucks, Amazon, Apple and dozens of other companies also filed over 2,000 petitions to form unions during the year – the most since 2015. Workers won 76% of the 1,363 elections that were held. Historically, however, these figures are tepid. The number of major work stoppages has been plunging for decades, from nearly 200 as recently as 1980. As of 2021, union membership was at about the lowest level on record, at 10.3%. In the 1950s, over one in three workers belonged to a union. The deck is still heavily stacked against unions, with unsupportive labour laws and very few employers showing real receptivity to having a unionised workforce. Unions are limited in how much they can change public policy. Reforming labour law through legislation has remained elusive, and the results of the 2022 midterms are not likely to make it easier. Nonetheless, public support for labour is at its highest since 1965, with 71% saying they approve of unions, according to a Gallup poll in August. And workers themselves are increasingly showing an interest in joining them. In 2017, 48% of workers polled said they would vote for union representation, up from 32% in 1995, the last time the question was asked. Future success may depend on unions’ ability to tap into their growing popularity and emulate the recent wins in establishing union representation at Starbucks and Amazon, as well as the successful “Fight for $15” campaign, which since 2012 has helped pass US$15 minimum wage laws in a dozen states and Washington DC. The odds may be steep, but the seeds of opportunity are there if labour can exploit them. This is an excerpt from an article published on January 5 2023. France: militant unions risk going too far Stéphanie Matteudi-Lecocq, Chercheuse au LEREDS, Directrice practice Chez Alixio, Université de Lille France in 2022 saw new industrial protests, from blockades of oil refineries, to unprecedented strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants, to rail workers staying at home on public holidays. TotalEnergies announced “super profits” in the second quarter of 2022 and increased CEO Patrick Pouyanné’s salary by 52% to €5,944,129. In September the militant CGT union demanded a 10% salary increase for workers and called for a strike at the group’s refineries. Five of Total’s refineries went on strike, joined by two owned by ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso. Esso was already talking to its unions about a pay deal, but Total had only planned to open negotiations in November. The strikes in the refineries threatened to bring France to a standstill, and the CGT used its power over this key resource to demand that discussions begin more quickly with Total (in the end, the company negotiated earlier and pay deals were done, ending the strikes by early November). The strike at EDF’s nuclear power stations similarly gave the company’s workers the balance of power because it made it impossible for France to build up energy reserves (since fossil fuels had to be burned to make up for the lack of nuclear power). In the end, the company signed deals with the unions in October. Unions may have succeeded in both cases, but they are arguably endangered by these kinds of practices. Too many trades union leaders remain stuck in their old militant ways. There’s a fragile balance between negotiation and protest, and such ransom tactics might damage unions’ public image, making dialogue more difficult in future. In 50 years, the rate of unionisation in France has already halved from over 20% to around 10%. It’s telling that two of the major strikes at the end of 2022, first by train workers and then by general practitioners, were initiated by groups independent from the unions. They both started spontaneously through social media and the unions found out very late. In 2023 the unions have an opportunity to improve their influence if they manage to prevent the government from passing its unpopular bill on pensions, which seeks to raise the full pensionable retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65. The unions have already announced their strong opposition to the bill. With major demonstrations due to take place after the full bill is presented today, January 10, it will be interesting to see their tactics. This is based on an excerpt from an article published in October 2022. Spain: unequal support measures could cause trouble Rubén Garrido-Yserte, Director del Instituto Universitario de Análisis Económico y Social, Universidad de Alcalá Global inflation is triggering a global economic slowdown and interest rates raised to levels not seen since before 2008. Interest rates will continue to rise in 2023, especially affecting economies as indebted as Spain. It will undermine both families’ disposable income and the profitability of companies (especially small ones), while making public debt repayments more expensive. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to cause a sustained increase in the cost of the shopping basket in the medium term. Government measures have partially mitigated this loss of purchasing power so far. Spain capped power prices, subsidised fuel and made public transport free for urbanites and commuters. There were agreements with banks to refinance mortgages for the most vulnerable families. Plus there have been increases in pensions and public salaries and there are plans to raise the minimum wage. However, many of these measures must necessarily be temporary. The danger is that they come to be seen as rights that should not be renounced. They also distort the economy and create problems with fairness by excluding or insufficiently supporting some groups. Private salaries will not rise enough to cover inflation, for instance. The government’s measures have been such that there has been very little industrial action in response to the cost of living crisis. The danger is that they create a scenario where today’s calm may be the harbinger of a social storm tomorrow.

Asked whether she expected a new offer to be on the table before the end of the week, Ms Somerville said: “We’ll continue discussions with the unions. “I think the challenge that we have is we remain some distance apart on what the Scottish Government and local government can afford and can put on the table from the union demand which is, of course, a 10% increase in pay. “If that had been accepted, if the 5% had been accepted, you would’ve actually seen teachers have a 21.8% cumulative rise since 2018. “So we’re trying very hard to have a fair and affordable package on the table but we do remain unfortunately some distance apart.” She added: “The pay demands we’re having from our trade union colleagues are simply unaffordable for the Scottish Government working on a fixed budget, already allocated, also eroded by inflation and that does make it a very difficult and challenging process to come to a conclusion and resolution on.” Earlier in the programme, Mike Corbett, NASUWT Scotland national official, echoed the concerns that unions and Government were still far away from agreement on pay. He said the last offer made in November was “dressed up as an improved offer” but did not improve pay for the “vast majority of teachers”. He added: “There’s still no formal revised offer on the table and that is the reason why our members and others feel they’ve got no alternative but to be out on strike again today and tomorrow.” Nicola Sturgeon also spoke to journalists about the strike on Tuesday.

Gareth Davies, the auditor and comptroller general at the NAO, said keeping on top of conflicts of interest was a “crucial part of public stewardship” that was not always followed during the VIP fast lane process. He said the government had given detailed responses on how it would improve its processes after reports from the NAO and others highlighting a failure to adhere to basic standards of procurement when awarding some contracts during the pandemic. But the auditor general said the NAO was watching closely to make sure its recommendations on procurement and pandemic preparedness “do not get lost” as the government deals with other crises such as Ukraine and high energy prices. “We are always careful to recognise the exceptional circumstances but despite the intense pressure it is always necessary to cover basic areas of transparency,” Davies said. “Publishing what you’ve done within the normal timescales is still possible even in an emergency and the whole process around conflicts of interest. “You may well need a speeded up system for referring plausible suppliers of PPE into the system but you should absolutely insist that people should declare it if they have a private interest in that supplier, particularly if they are holding a position of authority or responsibility like a peer or an MP or a senior civil servant. That just couldn’t be demonstrated. “There were clearly people attempting to do that at different stages but there wasn’t a clear trail of how that had been handled. The reason was the sheer pressure of the emergency but you can see now where that leads you if you are not careful.” His comments come after the scandal over Mone, on a leave of absence as a Conservative peer, who is the subject of an inquiry over her alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro during the pandemic. She has vowed to clear her name. Davies gave his assessment after the NAO carried out 36 detailed reports on the £300bn of government’s spending during the Covid pandemic. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the NAO was looking carefully at resilience to help the UK become better financially prepared for events that may require big public spending, guarding against the “collective failure of imagination” to prepare adequately for a major pandemic. He said there would be better “stress testing” of emergency responses, and the NAO would look at preparedness across the board, asking: “How do you avoid being caught out by this?” “You could argue it has happened on more than just Covid. What’s happening on energy is pretty unprecedented and needs another emergency scheme developed at high speed from scratch. We don’t want to have to do that every time,” he said. Davies also warned about the effects of inflation on public sector budgets, especially major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and roads, as well as highlighting the risks that the NHS will not meet its targets on eliminating waits of longer than a year by 2025. Davies said the NAO has been pointing out the “headwinds that the NHS is facing in implementing the planned approach” to waiting lists as well as highlighting the “numbers that the plan was based on assumed the best case scenario … not a severe winter in cases of flu and … [without] the industrial action that is currently under way”. He said the NAO’s report from November highlighted “serious risks” in meeting the 2025 target on eliminating waits of longer than 12 months and its job was now to monitor progress and “help identify barriers to getting through the backlog faster”. “Clearly, a lot of those risks that we identified are still present,” he added. Rishi Sunak recommitted to the NHS waiting list targets last week as one of his major priorities. Davies said inflation was a major risk to the NHS budget as well as departments with exposure to construction costs such as “HS2 and the other rail and road improvement schemes”. Warning that the government has “difficult decisions” ahead on major infrastructure projects, he said it was possible to reduce the scope of some projects or make the case for more money but on others said: “You either do it or you don’t: you have a have binary choice there. So there are some very difficult decisions for government.” Davies said HS2 was a “good example where the legs that have currently been committed to are going to cost more than when the most recent decision to recommit to the schemes was taken, so that’s going to have to be taken into account in one way or another, either through additional funding or through looking at the future scope of the scheme”.","MPs and peers should declare links to firms they back for contracts, says NAO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/mps-and-peers-should-declare-links-to-firms-they-back-for-contracts-says-nao

With the economy set to enter recession, the nation’s productivity puzzle will be a key challenge for the Prime Minister and businesses to overcome in the year ahead. “Productivity has a huge impact on the economy and people’s standard of living. But growing NHS waiting lists, diminishing access to treatment and surging economic inactivity due to ill-health are all weighing on productivity in the UK. “Businesses that proactively implement effective incentivisation and employee benefits programmes throughout their entire workforce will be best placed to retain staff, drive better performance and grow in a post-Covid landscape.”UK bank NatWest has announced a new package of Cost of Living support measures, including £5.7m of funding for charities and partners.NatWest is giving £1m to the Trussell Trust, the food bank charity, to support the Help through Hardship scheme, plus over £1.6m to the debt advice sector; £900k for Responsible Finance to support provision of accessible credit to people; and a £1m partnership with Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) to provide cost of living support.NatWest is also giving struggling customers more time to repay debts, it says: From early February this year, where customers have missed several payments on an unsecured debt such as a loan or overdraft, the bank will extend the time for them to repay their debt from 18 to 24 months, giving them more time and flexibility.

Régis Schultz, the chief executive of JD, said young shoppers had more cash in their pockets than a year ago thanks to the reopening of retail and hospitality which had provided jobs, while inflation had prompted people to go out and buy instead of waiting for bargains. He added that competition from online pure plays was waning as the costs of delivery racked up. “Investors are now saying to online players you have got to make money.

Heathrow says this is the highest passenger increase of any airport in Europe, “and possibly worldwide”.But it warns:We are concerned that the recovery of the aviation sector, which is critical to the economy, could be set back by the reintroduction of testing for travellers in the UK and elsewhere in response to increasing COVID levels in China, even though governments acknowledge there is no scientific basis for doing so.UK prime minister Rishi Sunak decided to introduce tests on arrivals from China at the end of December, after other countries including the US and Italy brought in similar measures.But scientists told the Observer that screening people coming from China would make little difference, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the UK was already very high, while airport checks had been shown to be unreliable in pinpointing disease carriers.Sunak’s U-turn on China Covid tests is a political move, say scientistsRead moreIf there is to be a correction in UK house prices, it will be driven by the homeowners whose fixed rate mortgage deals are set to expire over the next 12 months, says Zainab Atiyyah, analyst at Third Bridge.Mortgage and Bank of England interest rates started to increase during 2022 – and at least 1.4 millionUK households face the prospect of interest rate rises when they renew their fixed rate mortgages this year.➡️ https://t.co/HwWjla2Iwl pic.twitter.com/QKvIRIYbOU— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 9, 2023 But the UK’s “massive undersupply of new-build and second-hand houses.” will cushion that effect, Atiyyah points out.“Overall, our experts expect a slowdown in sales to continue in 2023 despite new stamp duty thresholds, as supply continues to dwindle.” “Those on Help to Buy deals will be crossing their fingers and hoping their deals don’t fall apart as new homes are delayed or not completed by the end of the year.

These claims, combined with further increases in motor inflation, have had a significant impact on our underwriting result for 2022.Direct Line says it expects around £90m of claims from the ‘freeze event’ in December. It has helped three thousand customers deal with burst pipes, water tanks and other related damage.Direct Line says:This, together with the freeze event from January 2022 and subsidence related claims over the summer means that we currently expect total weather claims to be in the region of £140 million for 2022, well above our 2022 expectation of £73 million.Direct Line’s motor insurance division also saw an increase in third party claims inflation during the fourth quarter of last year, and more claims in the quarter --partly due to adverse weather conditions.Shares in Direct Line have tumbled 28%, to 166p.JD Sports has also predicted its profits will be towards the top end of expectations, following a jump in sales over Christmas.JD Sports’ revenues grew by over 10% in the 22 weeks to 31 December 2022, accelerating to more than 20% in the six-weeks to 31 December 2022.It now expects pre-tax profits for the year to 28 January to be “towards the top end” of market expectations (£933m to £985m), although the final performance depends how the post-Christmas sales go.Shares in JD Sports have jumped 4.6% in early trading, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.Record sales of Champagne and prosecco have helped to push profits at Sainsbury’s to the upper end of forecasts.The supermarket chain has reported that profits this year are expected to be towards the upper end of its guidance range of £630m to £690m, although still below last year’s profits of £730m.J Sainsbury’s retail sales, excluding fuel, rose by 5.2% year-on-year in its third quarter (to 7th January). Grocery sales were 5.6% higher – and 12.5% ahead of pre-pandemic levels.And in the Christmas period, sales rose 7.1%, with grocery sales up 7.1%, general merchandise sales up 7.4% and clothing sales up 5.1%.That included a 22% jump in Taste the Difference Mince Pies, and a 49% rise in Taste the Difference Panettone, while there was “record sales for Champagne and prosecco”.But Simon Roberts, chief executive of J Sainsbury, flags that 2023 will be tough for households.“We understand money will be exceptionally tight this year particularly as many people wait for Christmas bills to land.

Rishi Sunak had previously refused to say whether he uses private healthcare, insisting it was ""not really relevant"". It followed a press report that Mr Sunak is registered with a private GP practice which charges £250 per consultation. At PMQs, Mr Sunak praised his local hospital ""for the fantastic care they have given my family"". ""That's why I'm passionately committed to protecting it with more funding, more doctors and nurses, and a clear plan to cut the waiting lists,"" he added. Mr Sunak had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that his healthcare was ""a personal choice"". ""As a general policy I wouldn't ever talk about me or my family's healthcare situation … it's not really relevant,"" he told the programme. Registering with an NHS GP does not exclude someone from using private healthcare. The prime minister's spokeswoman said Mr Sunak did not currently have private cover but declined to say when he registered with the NHS. ""In principle, he believes that the personal health details of individuals should remain private, but given the level of interest and in the interests of transparency he has set out that he is registered with a NHS GP,"" she said. A newspaper report in November suggested Mr Sunak was registered with a private GP practice that offers on-the-day appointments and home visits. Latest NHS figures show that in November last year, 58% of NHS patients were not seen on the day they made an appointment. At the same time, a record high of more than seven million people are waiting for hospital treatment. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in response to Mr Sunak's comments that the prime minister ""will find out what it's like to wait on hold at 08:00 as you call for an appointment"". Sir Keir's spokesman confirmed the Labour leader had never used private healthcare. He said he was ""not going to comment on individual health choices"" and Labour was focused on ""ensuring we have the best possible NHS"" for everyone in the country. Sir Keir also clashed with Mr Sunak over the government's plan for new legislation to enforce minimum service levels in the NHS and other key sectors. The Tories had gone ""from clapping nurses to sacking nurses"", Sir Keir said, adding that nurses and ambulance workers would not be on strike if the prime minister had negotiated. The prime minister said Sir Keir would not agree to minimum service levels in the NHS ""because he's on the side of his union paymasters, not patients"". Mr Sunak added that he wanted ""to have constructive dialogue with the unions"" and had accepted the recommendations of independent pay review bodies. Earlier, health unions announced they are pulling out of the NHS Pay Review Body process to determine pay for next year. The 14 unions - representing more than one million ambulance staff, nurses and other NHS workers in England - have called for direct negotiations with ministers about pay. Mr Sunak's comments followed Health Secretary Steve Barclay confirming he used an NHS doctor. Pressed on whether he has NHS care during an interview on LBC, Mr Barclay replied: ""Yes, I don't subscribe to private provision. ""But I don't have a problem with people, with their own money, who wish to spend that money on private healthcare. ""I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing for people to want to do."" Some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have made a point of drawing attention to their use of the NHS when they were prime minister. David Cameron often spoke about how the NHS cared for his disabled son, while Boris Johnson said the health service saved his life after he fell seriously ill with Covid. But when Mrs Thatcher was prime minister she was candid about her use of private health insurance, which she said was vital for her to ""go into hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want"".",PMQs: Rishi Sunak says he is registered with NHS doctor,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64237830?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Mr Kerr slammed the SNP for treating experienced workers as being easily replaceable after the report stated “the age profile of oil and gas workers means a significant proportion are expected to retire” during the First Minister’s acceleration of closing the industry. The energy strategy added it is positive that fewer young people were entering the sector, stating 12 per cent of the oil and gas workforce is under 30. This is despite warnings from the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board that more workers are required to meet future levels of labour demand. But the SNP’s aim of closing down the sector is at odds with what their Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, believes after he said last year that investment in North Sea oil and gas was vital for jobs in Aberdeen. Mr Kerr, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for net zero, energy and transport, said: “The SNP is threatening to destroy the lives of oil and gas workers with its uninformed intention of closing down the sector at its earliest point. “The assertion that the majority of these workers will be retiring is utterly reckless and a slap in the face to those who have dedicated years of service to such a valuable industry to our north-east economy. “This report implies it is a good thing fewer young people are entering the sector when all the evidence points to the very opposite as more people are needed to cope with labour demand. “The negative narrative of this is putting our younger generation off from having a long, productive career in an industry which supports countries worldwide. “Oil and gas is essential to securing our energy supply while also protecting tens of thousands of Scottish jobs. Yet this SNP energy strategy completely undermines the sector which will result in us relying on more expensive imports which do more damage to the environment. “This last week, many north-east residents watched in horror as a baleful, unnatural force threatened to hamper the livelihoods of North Sea workers. “After Nicola Sturgeon’s bid to toss more than 70,000 oil and gas jobs in the skip and wreck the energy transition, they should probably give it another week before trying to watch The Rig as well.” Do you want to respond to this article?

This is as true of climate chaos as anything else. We are hemmed in by stories that prevent us from seeing, or believing in, or acting on the possibilities for change. Some are habits of mind, some are industry propaganda. Sometimes, the situation has changed but the stories haven’t, and people follow the old versions, like outdated maps, into dead ends. We need to leave the age of fossil fuel behind, swiftly and decisively. But what drives our machines won’t change until we change what drives our ideas. The visionary organiser adrienne maree brown wrote not long ago that there is an element of science fiction in climate action: “We are shaping the future we long for and have not yet experienced. I believe that we are in an imagination battle.” In order to do what the climate crisis demands of us, we have to find stories of a livable future, stories of popular power, stories that motivate people to do what it takes to make the world we need. Perhaps we also need to become better critics and listeners, more careful about what we take in and who’s telling it, and what we believe and repeat, because stories can give power – or they can take it away. To change our relationship to the physical world – to end an era of profligate consumption by the few that has consequences for the many – means changing how we think about pretty much everything: wealth, power, joy, time, space, nature, value, what constitutes a good life, what matters, how change itself happens. As the climate journalist Mary Heglar writes, we are not short on innovation. “We’ve got loads of ideas for solar panels and microgrids. While we have all of these pieces, we don’t have a picture of how they come together to build a new world. For too long, the climate fight has been limited to scientists and policy experts. While we need their skills, we also need so much more. When I survey the field, it’s clear that what we desperately need is more artists.” What the climate crisis is, what we can do about it, and what kind of a world we can have is all about what stories we tell and whose stories are heard. Climate change was a story that fell on mostly indifferent ears when it was first discussed in the mainstream more than 30 years ago. Even a dozen years ago, it was supposed to be happening very slowly and in the distant future. There were a lot of references to “our grandchildren’s time”. It was a problem that was difficult to grasp – this dispersed, incremental, atmospheric, invisible, global problem with many causes and manifestations, whose solutions are also dispersed and manifold. That voices from the climate movement have finally succeeded in making the vast majority understand it, and many care passionately about it, might be the biggest single victory the movement will have. Because once you’ve won the popular imagination, you’ve changed the game and its possible outcomes. But this was a long, slow, arduous process, and misconceptions still abound. A lot of people don’t know that we’ve largely won the battle to make people aware and concerned. The LA Times ran a well-intentioned editorial last year about how most Americans don’t care about climate breakdown. That was true once, but no longer is. A Pew Research poll in 2020 concluded that two-thirds of Americans wanted to see more government action on climate, but last summer the scientific journal Nature published a study concluding that most Americans believe that only a minority (37-43%) support climate action, when in reality a large majority (66-80%) does. That gap between perceived and actual support undermines motivation and confidence. We need better stories – and sometimes better means more up to date. Outright climate denial – the old story that climate change isn’t real – has been rendered largely obsolete (outside social media) by climate-driven catastrophes around the globe and good work by climate activists and journalists. But other stories still stop us from seeing clearly. Greenwashing – the schemes created by fossil fuel corporations and others to portray themselves as on the environment’s side while they continue their profitable destruction – is rampant. It’s harder to recognise a false friend than an honest enemy, and their false solutions, delaying tactics and empty promises can be confusing for non-experts. Fortunately, as the climate movement has diversified, one new organisation, Clean Creatives, focuses specifically on pressuring advertising and PR agencies to stop doing the industry’s dirty work. Likewise, climate journalists are exposing how fossil fuel money is funding pseudo-environmental opposition to offshore wind turbines. (As the climate activist and oil policy analyst Antonia Juhasz recently told me, the climate movement is now going after every aspect of the fossil fuel industry, including funding by banks and, via the divestment movement, shares held by investors; donations to politicians; insurers; permits for extraction; transport; refinement; emissions, notably through lawsuits concerning their impact; shutting coal-fired power plants; and pushing for a rapid transition to electrification.) But we still lack stories that give context. For example, I see people excoriate the mining, principally for lithium and cobalt, that will be an inevitable part of building renewables – turbines, batteries, solar panels, electric machinery – apparently oblivious to the far vaster scale and impact of fossil fuel mining. If you’re concerned about mining on indigenous land, about local impacts or labour conditions, I give you the biggest mining operations ever undertaken: for oil, gas, and coal, and the hungry machines that must constantly consume them. Extracting material that will be burned up creates the incessant cycle of consumption on which the fossil fuel industry has grown fabulously rich. It creates climate chaos as well as destruction and contamination at every stage of the process. Globally, burning fossil fuels kills almost 9 million people annually, a death toll larger than any recent war. But that death toll is largely invisible for lack of compelling stories about it. All mining needs to be done with respect for the land and people in the vicinity, but the impact of mining for renewables needs to be weighed against the far more devastating impact of mining for and burning fossil fuel. The race is on to find battery materials that are more commonly available and less impactful than lithium and cobalt, and some of the results look promising. Last summer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced an aluminium-sulphur battery is in the works, while a US company is developing one that stores electricity using iron – the so-called “iron-air” battery. Efforts to extract battery materials from longterm coal waste in West Virginia are among the many others under way. And the Inflation Reduction Act includes funding to research better battery materials and domestic US sources. Other stories of premature defeat are all too common. In the 400,000-strong 2014 climate march in New York City, one section marched behind a huge banner declaring “WE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS” – but many people still believe we do not. We have the solutions we need in solar and wind; we just need to build them out and make the transition, fast. Looking to wildly ineffectual carbon sequestration and other undeveloped technologies as a relevant solution is like ignoring the lifeboats at hand in the hope that fancy new ones are coming when the ship is sinking and speed is of the essence. One story I frequently encounter frames the possibilities in absolutes: if we can’t win everything, then we lose everything. There are so many doom-soaked stories out there – about how civilisation, humanity, even life itself, are scheduled to die out. This apocalyptic thinking is due to another narrative failure: the inability to imagine a world different than the one we currently inhabit. People without much sense of history imagine the world as static. They assume that if the present order is failing, the system is collapsing, and there is no alternative. A historical imagination equips you to understand that change is ceaseless. You only have to look to the past to see such a world, dramatically different half a century ago, stunningly so a century ago. The UK, for example, ran almost entirely on coal power until the 1960s, and if you had said then that it would have to quit coal, many would have imagined this meant an utter collapse of the energy system, not its transformation. Even in 2008, the organisation Carbon Brief noted, “four-fifths of the UK’s electricity came from fossil fuels. Since then, the UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy. Coal-fired power has virtually disappeared and even gas use is down by a quarter. Instead, the country now gets more than half of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear.” Scotland already generates nearly all the electricity it needs from renewables. While I often hear people casually assert that our world is doomed, no reputable scientist makes such claims. Most are deeply worried, but far from hopeless. There are already profound losses, but our action or inaction determine how much more loss will occur, and whose it will be, and some repair is possible. Efforts sufficient to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lower temperatures and reverse some aspects of climate breakdown. Even the journalist David Wallace-Wells, who rose to fame with a deeply pessimistic book about climate a few years ago, has shifted his view. He currently describes a future somewhere between the best and worst case scenarios, a future “with the most terrifying predictions made improbable by decarbonisation and the most hopeful ones practically foreclosed by tragic delay. The window of possible climate futures is narrowing, and as a result, we are getting a clearer sense of what’s to come: a new world, full of disruption … yet mercifully short of true climate apocalypse.” A climate story we urgently need is one that exposes who is actually responsible for climate chaos. It’s been popular to say that we are all responsible, but Oxfam reports that over the past 25 years, the carbon impact of the top 1% of the wealthiest human beings was twice that of the bottom 50%, so responsibility for the impact and the capacity to make change is currently distributed very unevenly. By saying “we are all responsible”, we avoid the fact that the global majority of us don’t need to change much, but a minority needs to change a lot. This is also a reminder that the idea that we need to renounce our luxuries and live more simply doesn’t really apply to the majority of human beings outside what we could perhaps call the overdeveloped world. What is true of Beverly Hills is not true of the majority from Bangladesh to Bolivia. When it comes to who’s harming the climate, it’s also been popular to focus on individual contributions. The fossil fuel industry likes the narrative of personal responsibility as a way to keep us scrutinising ourselves and one another, rather than them. They’ve promoted the concept of climate footprints as a way to keep the focus on us and not them, and it’s worked. Usually if I ask people what they’re doing about the climate emergency, most will talk about what they’re not consuming or doing – but these will never add up to the speed and scale of change needed to change the system. One of the goals of system change is to supersede individual virtue. Just as you no longer have to opt in to buying a car with seatbelts or ask for the no-smoking section on the train or restaurant, at some point in the near future you won’t have to opt into travelling in an electric car or bus, or living or working in all-electric buildings. Electrification will have happened because of the collective action that takes shape as policy and regulation. Last year, the veteran environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a brilliant analysis pointing out that if you have money in one of the banks funding fossil fuels – especially, in the US, Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, and Bank of America – your retirement funds or savings account may have a much larger climate footprint than you do. The impact of your diet and how you get to work may pale in comparison to the impact of your money in the bank. The vegan on the bicycle may still be contributing to climate chaos if her life savings are in a bank lending her money to the fossil fuel industry. Individual impact, leaving the ultra-wealthy aside, matters mostly in the aggregate. And in aggregate we can change that. On 21 March, McKibben, via his new climate group Third Act (on whose advisory board I sit), and dozens of other climate groups will be organising actions by people with money in, or credit cards from, the key US banks, to try to force those institutions to stop funding fossil fuels. Our greatest power lies in our roles as citizens, not consumers, when we can band together to collectively change how our world works. Various campaigns around the world have focused on fossil finance, with significant successes behind them, and much more to achieve ahead. The climate movement has become far more sophisticated and precise in its targets in recent years. It’s doing a brilliant job; it just needs enough people and resources behind it to be more powerful than the status quo. Last year, I took three activists who were formerly part of the Sunrise Movement, a youth group campaigning to address climate breakdown, to see the 1991 film Terminator 2 at a cinema. The film was as great as I remembered, not least because the lead character, Linda Hamilton playing a ferocious young mother, chooses as her motto “no fate but what we make”. In that movie, the future has come back to meddle with the present through the sci-fi technologies of time travel and robot-warrior terminators. We see how actions in the present shape the future through tremendous battles over what that future will be. This is, of course, just as true in real life. We don’t get terminators and other time-travellers to tell us what the consequences of our actions are, but they still have consequences. You ban the insecticide DDT, and a lot of bird species stop dying out. You ban chlorofluorocarbons, and the hole in the ozone layer stops growing. In another way, Terminator 2 is less useful as a lens for thinking about the climate crisis. It’s part of the conventions of storytelling in film – and comics, fiction, graphic novels and too many news narratives – that tells us that the world can only be saved by exceptional individuals, often loners, whose gifts are often the capacity to inflict and endure extreme violence. Linda Hamilton and co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot, clobber, crush, outrun and outfight everything thrown at them, and that’s their celebrated skillset, along with a bit of dry humour. Humour aside, this has little to do with how the world really gets changed most of the time. The skills of real-world superheroes are solidarity, strategy, patience, persistence, vision and the ability to inspire hope in others. The rescuers we need are mostly not individuals, they are collectives – movements, coalitions, campaigns, civil society. Within those groups there may be someone with an exceptional gift for motivating others, but even the world’s greatest conductor needs an orchestra. One person cannot do much; a movement can topple a regime. We are sadly lacking stories in which collective actions or the patient determination of organisers is what changes the world. Another thing we get from our films and fictions is the expectation of a single solution and a clear resolution to our problems: a sudden victory, a celebration, and the trouble is over. The climate crisis does not fit easily into this format. Ceasing to extract and burn fossil fuel is central, but there is no single solution. Protecting carbon-sequestering peat bogs, forests and grasslands also matters; so does transforming high-impact materials such as cement; implementing better design for buildings, transport and cities, and addressing soil conservation, farming and food production and consumption. There are milestones and important goals, but the familiar Hollywood ending – crossing the finish line to wrap up the story – doesn’t describe this reality. Change often functions more like a relay race, with new protagonists picking up where the last left off. In 2019, a Berkeley city councilwoman decided to propose banning fossil-gas connections in new construction, and it was passed by the council unanimously. This small city’s commitment to all-electric new buildings could seem insignificant, but more than 50 other California municipalities picked it up, as did the city of New York. The state of New York failed to pass a similar measure, but Washington state succeeded, and the idea that new construction should not include gas has spread internationally. Such relay races have long been how human rights campaigns work: a good protest, campaign, or even piece of legislation can introduce new ideas that do their own work in the world at large. Even failed campaigns may succeed in opening the path for later change. The Green New Deal did not pass in the US Senate, but it became a template for the Biden administration’s climate legislation, and shifted the conversation about what is possible. It led the way to the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate bill the US has ever passed. Opponents of environmental action often say it is killing jobs; the Green New Deal did a lot to change that story by portraying climate action as a job creator. Recognising the reality of climate breakdown means recognising the interconnectedness of all things. That connection brings obligation: to respect nature, to build domestic regulation and international treaties that protect what’s needed, to limit the freedom of the individual in the name of the wellbeing of the collective. This is, of course, a worldview in direct contrast with free-market fundamentalism and libertarianism. Even the facts of climate science are ideologically offensive to people committed to individual freedom without accountability, let alone the demands created by treaties and regulations. Responsibility and obligation are dismal words in mainstream culture, so perhaps there will be other stories that recognise this process as reciprocity and relationship, in which we give back, in gratitude and respect for all the Earth does for us. Even short of that, we can recognise our self-interest in maintaining the system on which life depends. If news is the daily report on what’s just happened, we need a way of pulling back from individual events, to see the broad context of how it happened. If you only tell short-term stories, it all becomes kind of meaningless. Martin Luther King Jr said: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” We’ve seen it bend a lot of ways in recent years, toward and away from justice, but it takes time just to see it bend at all. You need benchmarks or memories of how things used to be even to see change of any kind, including climate change. The South Pacific climate activist and poet Julian Aguon recently declared that Indigenous peoples “have a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory, and just might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect – for the Earth and for each other”. That emphasis on collective memory suggests that a strong sense of the past allows for a strong sense of the future, that remembering difficulty and transformation equips us to face them again. One of the things that buoys me up is the long arc of change in renewable technology. Mostly what you see in the news about renewables is short-term: stories on the latest drop in price, or proliferation of solar and wind over the past year or two. If you enlarge your time frame, you see that those annual changes have amounted to an astonishing plummet in prices and rise in efficiency and global use, compounded by innovations in materials and storage. Twenty years ago we did not have constructive ways to leave the age of fossil fuel behind. Now we do. And the solutions keep getting better. In 2021, the organisation Carbon Tracker put out a report that showed current technology could produce 100 times as much electricity from solar and wind than current global demand. The report concludes: “The technical and economic barriers have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political.” At the end of the last millennium, those barriers seemed insurmountable. The change is revolutionary, but the revolution was too slow to be visible to most. The report continues: “At the current 15-20% growth rates of solar and wind, fossil fuels will be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050. The unlocking of energy reserves 100 times our current demand creates new possibilities for cheaper energy and more local jobs in a more equitable world, with far less environmental stress.” We tend to think utopias are unbelievable, but this is a sober-minded thinktank focused on climate and energy politics. The report made little impact on the general public. Because the energy revolution has been incremental, there’s been no single breakthrough moment. Yet it adds up to an encouraging, and even astonishing narrative. On the other hand, people find grim narratives all too believable, whether or not they are grounded in fact. We are still inundated by harmful, as well as untrue, stories about climate and the future. Prophecies can be self-fulfilling: if you insist that we cannot possibly win, you pit yourself against the possibility of victory and the people trying to achieve it. There’s yet another narrative that’s persisted at least since the invention of compact fluorescent lightbulbs and the Toyota Prius: that we must renounce abundance and enter an age of austerity. It’s all in the telling. To consider our age an age of abundance, you have to be counting sheer accumulated stuff and ignoring how it is distributed. That is, we live in an age of extreme wealth for some, and desperation for the many. But there’s another way to count wealth and abundance – as hope for the future, safety and public confidence, emotional wellbeing, love and friendship and strong social networks, meaningful work and purposeful lives, equality and justice and inclusion. Early on, we heard that renewables were very expensive – this was part of the austerity narrative, or an excuse for not making the transition. But improvements in design and economies of scale are among the factors making them the cheapest form of electricity almost everywhere on earth. There’s no reason to think the innovations of design and economic improvements are all behind us; I suspect they’re mostly ahead of us. Engineer and energy expert Saul Griffith recently wrote: “Most people believe a clean-energy future will require everyone to make do with less, but it actually means we can have better things.” The old story was that we couldn’t afford to do what the climate emergency required. The new one is that it would not only be ecologically devastating, but more expensive not to. Renewables are on the way to being cheaper than fossil fuel; in many places, they already are. Texas and Iowa get a huge amount of their electricity from wind because it makes economic sense, not because these red states are passionate about addressing the climate crisis. Over their lifetime, electric cars work out to be cheaper than internal combustion cars because charging and maintaining them is cheaper. And of course these two examples don’t include the indirect effects of burning fossil fuels on human health and the climate. A lot of people tend to measure climate action in terms of huge national or international news events, but the change that matters is often happening at local and regional and other levels. A university divests; a state sets a date for ending the sale of new petrol cars; a city passes a measure mandating all-electric new buildings; ground is broken on a major solar installation; a state or country sets a new record for percentage of wind power in its energy mix; a pipeline or gas terminal or drilling site gets cancelled; a carbon-sequestering forest or peat bog gets protected status; a coal plant closes. This does not erase all the bad news, about continuing breakdown of natural systems and its toll on human lives and impact on a livable future, but it does contextualise them as crises we can respond to if we choose to. So much is happening, both wonderful and terrible, and it adds up to more stories than almost anyone can take in. But the overarching frameworks in which we receive them matter, and so do the critical skills to recognise, choose, and change stories. The climate crisis is a problem with no single solution, but many, just as there is no one saviour, but many protagonists in the struggle. In 2019, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said we must embrace “cathedral thinking”, adding: “We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.” The speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler included this passage in one of her essays: “OK,” the young man challenged. “So what’s the answer?” “There isn’t one,” I told him. “No answer? You mean we’re just doomed?” He smiled as though he thought this might be a joke. “No,” I said. “I mean there’s no single answer that will solve all of our future problems. There’s no magic bullet. Instead there are thousands of answers – at least. You can be one of them if you choose to be.” This is an edited version of a speech given at Princeton University in November 2022","‘If you win the popular imagination, you change the game’: why we need new stories on climate",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/12/rebecca-solnit-climate-crisis-popular-imagination-why-we-need-new-stories

Unions had made it clear more money would have to be offered to head off an escalation of stoppages. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), said: “This meeting was a total farce. Despite being well-trailed by the Government as a chance to resolve the crisis, it was nothing of the sort because the minister had nothing to offer. “He didn’t deny our members were being offered less than anyone else, he didn’t deny tens of thousands of our members only get a pay rise because of the rise in the national minimum wage but he refused to give us a pay rise now. “Despite all we told him, despite knowing the alternative would be sustained industrial action, he still refused to budge, saying he could only talk about 2023-24. “We will not stand by and watch our members be condemned to low pay. “We’ve tried talking but it appears the only option open to us is to force them to change their mind, and the only way we can do that is to escalate our strike action. “Because of the minister’s refusal to help us now, the one-day strike we announced yesterday will go ahead as promised on February 1, and we shall look to escalate our action further, calling more members out on more strikes until the Government listens to us.” Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said the talks had been “cordial” but “lacked anything concrete” from the Government. He said that “we could not have been clearer” that if the Government “want to resolve disputes, which they say they do, then it requires something tangible to be put on the table, not simply more ‘listening mode’ meetings”. Other talks were being held to try to resolve disputes in the NHS and on the railways, amid ongoing strikes causing disruption in parts of the country. A meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay was described as “constructive” by a doctors’ union leader. Professor Philip Banfield, chair of council at the British Medical Association (BMA), told reporters: “It went as we expected. We went into the meeting to discuss the pay review body and we came out of the meeting having laid out our stall and making it very clear the state of the NHS and that, really, the pay dispute with the junior doctors has to include some form of addressing full pay restoration.” Asked about their call for restoration to 2008 pay levels, which would be a 26% uplift, he said: “Twenty-six per cent is a lot to lose from your salary, so although it’s a lot of money, it’s a lot of money to lose as well. “We’ve got junior doctors who are really struggling financially now because they are qualifying with £100,000 of debt. “What was constructive today was the willingness to listen and to get into the room and discuss what pay restoration may or may not look like.” Officials from the Rail Delivery Group were meeting with the Rail, Maritime and Transport union and Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association in a fresh bid to break the deadlocked rail dispute. Transport Secretary Mark Harper raised hopes of a breakthrough within “days” as he confirmed a “renewed offer” was on the table ahead of the talks. The unions have made it clear they need a new offer on pay, jobs and conditions before the dispute can end. Workers on London’s Elizabeth line were on strike while the capital’s bus workers at Abellio were also taking industrial action. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The Minister for the Cabinet Office, Jeremy Quin, met with representatives from civil service trade unions today to listen to and understand their concerns. This forms part of the Government’s commitment to engaging with unions across the board. “The meeting included discussions to help ensure fair and affordable public sector pay settlements. “We regret the PCS decision to call further strike action, but discussions will continue and we have comprehensive plans in place to keep essential services running and to minimise disruption.”",Strike by civil servants to go ahead after talks dismissed as ‘total farce’,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/government-border-force-b1052538.html

Despite being well-trailed by the Government as a chance to resolve the crisis, it was nothing of the sort because the minister had nothing to offer. “He didn’t deny our members were being offered less than anyone else, he didn’t deny tens of thousands of our members only get a pay rise because of the rise in the national minimum wage but he refused to give us a pay rise now. “Despite all we told him, despite knowing the alternative would be sustained industrial action, he still refused to budge, saying he could only talk about 2023-24. “We will not stand by and watch our members be condemned to low pay. “We’ve tried talking but it appears the only option open to us is to force them to change their mind, and the only way we can do that is to escalate our strike action. “Because of the minister’s refusal to help us now, the one-day strike we announced yesterday will go ahead as promised on February 1, and we shall look to escalate our action further, calling more members out on more strikes until the Government listens to us.” Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said the talks had been “cordial” but “lacked anything concrete” from the Government. He said that “we could not have been clearer” that if the Government “want to resolve disputes, which they say they do, then it requires something tangible to be put on the table, not simply more ‘listening mode’ meetings”. Other talks were being held to try to resolve disputes in the NHS and on the railways, amid ongoing strikes causing disruption in parts of the country. A meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay was described as “constructive” by a doctors’ union leader. Professor Philip Banfield, chair of council at the British Medical Association (BMA), told reporters: “It went as we expected. We went into the meeting to discuss the pay review body and we came out of the meeting having laid out our stall and making it very clear the state of the NHS and that, really, the pay dispute with the junior doctors has to include some form of addressing full pay restoration.” Asked about their call for restoration to 2008 pay levels, which would be a 26% uplift, he said: “Twenty-six per cent is a lot to lose from your salary, so although it’s a lot of money, it’s a lot of money to lose as well. “We’ve got junior doctors who are really struggling financially now because they are qualifying with £100,000 of debt. “What was constructive today was the willingness to listen and to get into the room and discuss what pay restoration may or may not look like.” Officials from the Rail Delivery Group were meeting with the Rail, Maritime and Transport union and Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association in a fresh bid to break the deadlocked rail dispute. Transport Secretary Mark Harper raised hopes of a breakthrough within “days” as he confirmed a “renewed offer” was on the table ahead of the talks. The unions have made it clear they need a new offer on pay, jobs and conditions before the dispute can end. Workers on London’s Elizabeth line were on strike while the capital’s bus workers at Abellio were also taking industrial action. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The Minister for the Cabinet Office, Jeremy Quin, met with representatives from civil service trade unions today to listen to and understand their concerns. This forms part of the Government’s commitment to engaging with unions across the board. “The meeting included discussions to help ensure fair and affordable public sector pay settlements. “We regret the PCS decision to call further strike action, but discussions will continue and we have comprehensive plans in place to keep essential services running and to minimise disruption.”",Strike by civil servants to go ahead after talks dismissed as ‘total farce’,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-unions-mark-serwotka-public-and-commercial-services-union-mark-harper-b2260872.html

If its construction goes to plan, a €2.5 billion (£2.18 billion) undersea pipeline will convey “green hydrogen” from Spain to France from 2030. In the US, some power stations are being upgraded to allow hydrogen to be blended with fossil gas, and the Norwegian oil company Equinor is teaming up with Thermal SSE to build a 1,800 megawatt (MW) “blue hydrogen” power plant in Britain. Meanwhile, China unveiled a plan in March which includes deploying 50,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2025 and early December saw the first hydrogen-fuelled tractors and forklifts leave the assembly line at a new plant in Guangdong province. Hydrogen is produced in multiple ways. A colour spectrum is used to render it simple. “Grey” and “brown/black” hydrogen come from fossil gas (methane) and coal (brown or black coal) respectively – a process that, for every tonne of hydrogen, emits between ten and 12 tonnes of CO₂ for grey hydrogen and 18 to 20 for brown. “Blue” is the same process except the carbon dioxide is supposed to be captured and stored underground. And “green” hydrogen is conventionally defined as generated from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. But only 0.04% of hydrogen is green, and blue hydrogen is less than 1%. The rest is grey or brown, most of which is used in oil refineries and for manufacturing ammonia and methanol. It’s an enormous industry which emits more CO₂ than all of Britain and France combined. It is widely hoped that a silver lining of today’s high gas prices will be green hydrogen becoming a cost-competitive alternative to dirty fuels in boilers, shipping tankers and steelworks furnaces. Unfortunately, without electricity market reform, this opportunity is likely to be squandered. And while the buzz around the hydrogen economy intensifies, a closer look suggests the fuel is less a spearhead for a green transition and more the subject of an elaborate bait-and-switch operation by oil companies. Hydrogen’s true colours Green hydrogen is essential for decarbonisation: to replace fossil fuels in steelmaking, ammonia production for fertilisers and possibly shipping and trucking – processes which are difficult to electrify. Some green hydrogen is crosshatched with dirtier hues. So it’s not simply that in its production a lot of energy is wasted in the double transformation from electricity to gas and then fuel. But burning hydrogen also emits nitrogen oxides, air pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain. If green hydrogen production is scaled up to play a significant economic role by 2050, its freshwater demand will exceed one-quarter of today’s global annual consumption, risking water scarcity in some regions. Above all, hydrogen is meaningfully green only if the renewable energy that generates it cannot be fed into the grid to replace power from gas or coal plants. Blue hydrogen relies on a similar – but much more harmful – trick of the light. For hydrogen to be true blue, the emissions must be captured and securely stored. In theory, carbon capture and storage works but nearly all plants use the captured carbon to pump more oil and many have been shut down as failures. Only a handful store carbon indefinitely and even these consume lots of energy and capture only some of the CO₂, which can leak. Blue hydrogen’s main source is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is notorious for escaping drilling wells and pipelines. Research suggests that these issues make blue hydrogen worse for the climate than fossil gas. In the EU, as in many economies, electricity pricing is based on the principle of marginal costs, which means that the most expensive source (typically fossil gas) sets the wholesale power price. During sunny or windy spells, a glut of renewable energy generation can slash electricity prices, freeing them from the grip of natural gas prices for a few hours at a time. This is often not enough to justify investments in the electrolysers which produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen won’t gain the necessary price advantage over blue hydrogen and fossil gas until electricity markets are restructured. Meanwhile, the high price of oil and gas has turbocharged the industry’s expansion. The US government is exhorting oil and fracking firms to “drill baby drill”. Britain’s government is to award more than 100 licenses to drill for oil and gas and colossal new fossil fuel investments have been announced across the Middle East and Africa. In a few years when these new sources come onstream, and particularly if economic growth continues to slow and depress energy demand, gas and oil will become cheaper again – until the next price spike prompts new rounds of investment, and the infernal cycle continues. The owners of newly-built wells, pipelines and terminals will fight to defend those assets and stall decarbonisation. Now fossil-fuel firms are rebranding themselves as agents of “carbon management.” The aim is to prevent their assets from getting stranded by repurposing them, presenting a largely fictional substance, blue hydrogen, as a low-carbon “bridge” to an unspecified green future. Other sectors have joined the oil-led coalition. As the engineer Tom Baxter observes, gas network operators and boiler manufacturers see their survival in this ploy. Utilities are similarly keen, as hydrogen’s inefficiencies allow them to sell more power. Tackling this stalling operation requires public policy. Governments will need to regulate or tax carbon out of the market while simultaneously ramping up renewables. The approach to electricity pricing also needs to shift, to decouple the prices of electricity generated from renewables and fossil gas. The marginal pricing system hugely benefits renewable project owners, since they profit from high electricity prices and effectively zero input costs. An alternative market structure would set rewards for generators according to their average costs plus a slight surplus which could be reinvested into deploying more renewables and other green technologies, providing consumers with cheap electricity. This can only be achieved through a robustly regulated market or by nationalising energy companies and setting prices and production. These interventions would give green hydrogen a competitive advantage over blue or grey variants, one that could be furthered with other subsidies, such as tax credits on the model of the US Inflation Reduction Act. Above all, energy demand must be reduced to ease upward pressure on price. In any future energy system, hydrogen will have a role. But its expansion must be carefully designed, to prevent the promise of green hydrogen disguising the risks of its blue and grey cousins.

The company, which is part of Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, will begin consultations over 440 redundancies and said it will idle its plant at West Bromwich and convert another in Newport, Wales, into a storage facility. Jobs are also likely to be lost at its Rotherham plant after Liberty said it became “unviable” to produce cheaper steel products, “due to high energy costs and imports from countries without the same environmental standards”. The firm will now focus on steel for defence, energy and aircraft-making clients in a bid to regain profitability. Jeffrey Kabel, Chief Transformation Officer for Liberty Steel Group said: “While our action is expected to regrettably impact the roles of some of our workforce we will provide a level of guaranteed salary and placement opportunities.” He added: “We remain committed to our longer-term growth plans in the UK including our plan to grow Rotherham into a 2 million tonne green steel hub.” Cheap imports from China, where European producers say lax pollution regulations make the material cheaper to make, are squeezing margins on cheaper steel products such as the thick rebar staves used to reinforce concrete in the construction industry. But Britain is also at a disadvantage to European producers, according to UK Steel, the industry group. It estimates that German producers will pay £107 per megawatt hour of electricity in the coming financial year compared to £174 for UK steel mills. Electric furnaces are seen as the future of many UK steel mills as wind power becomes an increasing part of power supply. The steel sector employs 34,500 people directly in the UK and supports a further 43,000 in supply chains. The jobs are often in areas with few other skilled careers and they offer a salary averaging £37,629, 45pc higher than the UK national average. Alun Davies, Community steelworkers' union national officer, said: “This announcement is a body blow to Liberty Steel’s loyal UK workforce, who couldn’t have done more to get the company through an exceptionally challenging period.” Liberty Steel, the UK’s third-largest steel maker after Tata and British Steel, employs 1,900 people in the UK as well as 5,000 contractors. It said Rotherham could lose 185 jobs, while 121 were at risk in Newport, where the company makes thin plates of steel known as hot rolled coil. West Bromwich could lose 99 jobs, and 35 could be lost in Tredegar in South Wales. Both sites make steel tubes. Liberty was hit by the collapse of Greensill Capital from which it borrowed $5bn (£4.1bn). Mr Gupta’s businesses had borrowed from ventures founded by Australian entrepreneur Lex Greensill, which loaned money to companies short term. It collapsed after one of its insurers refused to renew cover. In November, Liberty reached an understanding with creditors to Lex Greensill’s former lending empire including Swiss bank Credit Suisse, in what it called a major step in refinancing the troubled businesses.",Liberty Steel to make over 400 staff redundant as energy costs hammer industry,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/12/liberty-steel-make-400-staff-redundant-energy-costs-hammer-industry/

Thursday saw several developments in Britain’s many industrial disputes as it emerged the ambulance union will meet next week to consider six more strike days. Staff at more than 150 universities across the country are demanding that employers push up their offer of a 3 per cent pay rise after more than a decade of below-inflation increases, the union said. “The clock is now ticking for the sector to produce a deal or be hit with widespread disruption throughout spring,” UCU general secretary Jo Grady said. Meanwhile, around 100,000 civil servants have also decided to go ahead with a walkout next month after failed talks with the government were dismissed as a “total farce”. Doctors’ unions told health secretary Steve Barclay that he must address the “workforce crisis” at a meeting on Thursday, during which there was no movement on pay demands, while a ballot of a teacher’s union failed to meet the threshold for strike action. Talks aimed at resolving the long-running rail dispute were also set to continue following meetings between unions and employers on Thursday. Further ambulance strikes loom as figures showed emergency response times had fallen to their worst on record, with more than one in 10 people left waiting for paramedics for more than three-and-a-half hours after calling, including with serious illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of damaging the NHS. Speaking in Belfast, he said: “The most important thing is that these strikes are ended. They will only be ended if the government gets in the room and negotiates and so instead of grandstanding, they need to govern.” Mr Barclay was given a “very clear message” that it would not be enough to focus on next year’s NHS settlement with doctors without a shift on current wages, union leaders said. Representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA), hospital doctors’ union the HCSA, and the British Dental Association (BDA) all met Mr Barclay on Thursday at what was described by both sides as a “constructive” meeting. A strike by 100,000 civil servants will go ahead next month after talks with the government aimed at resolving a bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions broke down. Cabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin met with union leaders to discuss growing industrial unrest after weeks of stoppages across the country, including by Border Force staff over Christmas. Unions had made it clear more money would have to be offered to head off an escalation of stoppages. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), said: “This meeting was a total farce. Despite being well-trailed by the government as a chance to resolve the crisis, it was nothing of the sort because the minister had nothing to offer. “He didn’t deny our members were being offered less than anyone else, he didn’t deny tens of thousands of our members only get a pay rise because of the rise in the national minimum wage but he refused to give us a pay rise now.” Nine out of 10 members of the Nasuwt teachers union in England and Wales voted for strikes over pay but the turnout was 42 per cent, falling short of the 50 per cent legal requirement. Nasuwt general secretary Patrick Roach said the union remains “in formal disputes with ministers and employers and will be continuing to take forward our campaigning for a Better Deal for Teachers. He said: “The readiness of our members to support industrial action demonstrates the anger of the profession and the need for governments in England and Wales to engage in meaningful negotiations to address the deep concerns of our members. “Our campaign to fight for the real-terms pay awards that teachers and headteachers deserve continues.” Leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) met separately with the Rail Delivery Group on Thursday. Both sides said detailed discussions were held and they were working towards a revised offer. Strikes have been held since last summer in the row over pay, jobs and conditions, causing huge disruption to services. No more strikes have been called. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said: “We have been in detailed discussions with the Rail Delivery Group for the train operating companies. We are working jointly towards a revised offer for their section of the dispute. “We’ve agreed that over the next couple of days we’ll continue to work on that through discussions, and we’ll see what comes of it.” Additional reporting by Press Association.",University staff to walk out for 18 days as ambulance workers consider further strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/strikes-ambulance-trains-nhs-teachers-b2261200.html

The James Hutton Institute has signed construction contracts with McLaughlin & Harvey worth £28.7m for the next stage of the ongoing redevelopment of its Invergowrie estate. This new contract comprises the construction of a combined Advanced Plant Growth Centre (APGC) and international barley hub (IBH). The new building – with the APGC downstairs and the IBH above – will be full of the latest state-of-the-art scientific equipment. This will include computing facilities, imaging technology, sensor-based systems, robotics and controlled environmental cabinets for growing plants. The project, funded by £62m from the Tay Cities Deal, is part of a masterplan to create two institute-led innovation centres at Invergowrie. It will help establish Scotland as a leader in global food security and crop resilience. Enabling works are ongoing on-site. A number of older buildings are being demolished to make way for the new facility. It will be built in the heart of the Invergowrie Campus and is due to be completed in early 2024. A ‘significant milestone’ for £62m project James Hutton Institute chief executive Colin Campbell hailed a “significant milestone” for the project. He added: “It aims to futureproof the barley sector across Scotland and the UK. “This new facility will serve as the key research hub. “It is set to bring around £60 million benefit and over 1,200 jobs to Scotland over the next 10 years.” UK Government Minister for Scotland Malcolm Offord said the facility will support “the future prosperity of our farming industry”. He also welcomed the creation of jobs in the region. Mr Offord said: “The UK Government is investing £45m at the James Hutton Institute through the Tay Cities Deal. “These new facilities will undertake vital research that will support food security and the future prosperity of our farming industry, while also creating new jobs for the region. McLaughlin & Harvey’s operations director Robbie Clark said the firm was delighted to be working on the project. He said: “Having recently completed the state-of-the-art Barley Field Centre facilities, our highly experienced project team will now move seamlessly on to the delivery of the new Advanced Plant Growth Centre and International Barley Hub.” Newly filed accounts for its commercial arm, James Hutton Limited, show it made pre-tax profits of over £600,000 for the year to March 2022.

At first, there is often outrage that the usual supremacy of bosses over workers has been suspended. Preserving such hierarchies is one of Conservatism’s main aims. But then there is sometimes a sense of opportunity: a belief that the strikers and their supporters may fall into a familiar trap, set by decades of anti-union legislation and press propaganda. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have believed that strikes can be used to make Tory governments look tough, and to discredit Labour and the wider left. The succession of aggressive, deliberately provocative anti-strike measures announced over the last six months by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak all reflect an assumption that taking on the unions is one of the few remaining strategies that might get the Conservatives re-elected. Yet there is also a third, almost forgotten Tory approach to strikes. Before the Thatcher government, her predecessor as Conservative premier, Edward Heath, faced with strikes that, like today’s, were highly disruptive and yet had considerable public support, was sometimes forced to negotiate and make concessions. As the leader of an unpopular government presiding over a fragile economy that the strikes were weakening further, Heath reluctantly accepted that the unions could not all be beaten. The briefly more constructive tone of some of this week’s talks between ministers and union leaders could be a sign that Sunak, too, will ultimately have to concede at least partial victories to some of the strikers. Like Heath, he is not a dominant or charismatic enough prime minister to change the national conversation about strikes and unions, as Thatcher did. His administration could finally mark the beginning of the end for the version of union-bashing Conservatism she invented, which seems increasingly irrelevant to today’s world of poverty wages and modest union memberships. Alternatively, the industrial relations of Sunak’s premiership could be much messier. Like the party he leads – for now, at least – the prime minister’s political thinking is an unstable, quite possibly unsustainable mix, including a desire to be pragmatic and “reasonable”, a dogmatic belief in markets as the best distributors of economic rewards, and an elite remoteness from ordinary working lives. His government’s attitude to the strikes is to be more conciliatory and more confrontational at the same time. Some strikers may be offered one-off bonuses and better pay rises; others, if they refuse to provide so-far-undefined “minimum service” in sectors from health to education may in future be sacked – despite being participants in walkouts that were democratically agreed and wholly legal when launched. For days now, the government has presented this minimum service legislation as an even-handed measure, to “restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption”. But claiming that a better “balance” between trade unionists and the public is required – rather than acknowledging that in millions of cases trade unionists and the public are the same people – has been a partisan Tory ploy for decades. British life has been tilted against unions since the 80s. And the Tories have never shown any interest in balancing the relationship between the public and other, more powerful and disruptive, but right-leaning, economic protagonists, such as the City of London. The disingenuous and vaguely worded minimum service bill also echoes recent draconian legislation aimed partly at road-blocking climate activists, “to balance the rights of protesters against the rights of others to go about their daily business”. Sunak may present himself as a centre-right technocrat, but partly out of panic at the mounting opposition to his government and Conservatism in general, he is increasingly ruling as an authoritarian. The government insists it supports the right to strike. The business secretary, Grant Shapps – often selected to try to make extreme policies sound moderate – said on the BBC’s Today programme earlier this week that the “ideal outcome” of the bill would be for the government “to have the power” to set minimum service levels “and never have to use it”, because unions would voluntarily set their own. But this scenario is less reassuring than it was meant to sound. If strikes in much of the economy are required to come with their own strike-breaking operations, of a size dictated directly or indirectly by the government, something fundamental to workplace politics has been altered. It’s possible that the bill may never become law, since it seems to contravene protections for unions in the European convention on human rights. And even if the legislation survives challenges in the courts, the Commons and the Lords, and on the streets (the TUC has announced a “national right to strike day” on 1 February) it may be hard to implement. Minimum service levels will have to be defined for a vast range of different workplaces, and then enforced without sacking too many essential staff or creating too many union martyrs. Yet to focus on such difficulties, enormous though they are, is to miss part of the point of this latest attack on strikers. Like many Tory policies since and including Brexit, the bill is meant to be symbolic and divisive as much as practical, to create bogeymen and energise Tory supporters. If inflation falls as expected between now and the election, and the strikers’ pay claims therefore seem less justified to many voters, then a continuing anti-union culture war might be timely. Without a Thatcher, fresh rightwing ideas or much remaining administrative energy, today’s Tories probably can’t run a reforming government that really hurts the left – but they can pretend. The problem with this impersonation of radicalism, though, is that it requires enough voters to be taken in. And Johnson’s drifting premiership, Truss’s shambolic tenure and now Sunak’s tone-deaf performance in 10 Downing Street have removed the Conservatives’ credibility as a governing party. Even the union-hating press hasn’t given the minimum service bill as much coverage as you might expect, which suggests uncertainty about its significance. Half a century ago, as well as negotiating with unions, Heath’s government also tried to weaken them through legislation. The 1970 industrial relations bill eventually became law despite huge protests. But it was widely flouted, and he lost the next election. If you’re a struggling Tory prime minister, victories on paper over the workers probably won’t save you.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded an increase of 0.1% as the services sector remained in growth despite the soaring cost of living. Experts at the ONS said the slight rise was supported by the technology sector and a strong showing by pubs and bars amid a boost from the winter World Cup in Qatar. It nevertheless represented a slowdown in growth after GDP increased by 0.5% in October. Analysts had predicted the economy would shrink by 0.3% for November. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy grew a little in November, with increases in telecommunications and computer programming helping to push the economy forward. “Pubs and bars also did well as people went out to watch World Cup games. “This was partially offset by further falls in some manufacturing industries, including the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, as well as falls in transport and postal, partially due to the impact of strikes. “Over the last three months, however, the economy still shrank – mainly due to the impact of the extra bank holiday for the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in September.” Consumer-facing industries were the biggest growth driver of the month, witnessing a 0.4% increase amid a lift from higher food and drink sales during the World Cup. The service sector also grew by 0.2% as more punters visited pubs and other venues, although this still reflected a slowdown from a 0.7% rise a month earlier. In November, the construction sector saw growth fall away as it stayed flat for the month following a 0.4% rise in October. Elsewhere, manufacturing was the main cause of a 0.2% decline in the production sector for the period. The ONS added that GDP still contracted by 0.3% over the three months to November despite the latest growth. The economy also declined by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2022 and would therefore enter a technical recession if a further fall is recorded for the final quarter of the year. Economists have suggested that the latest data makes it less clear whether the UK will have entered a recession at the end of last year. Kitty Usher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “This is stronger activity than was expected for November and so will further contribute to the improvement in market sentiment we have seen in the last few weeks. “Given we know the economy also grew in October – albeit driven by a rebound from the period of state mourning – it is no longer certain that the economy will meet the technical definition of a recession when the final data for 2022 is in.” It comes as inflation started to cool down in November, dropping to 10.7% from a 41-year-high of 11.1% a month earlier, and it is expected to drop further through 2023. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said: “We have a clear plan to halve inflation this year – an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world. “To support families through this tough patch, we will provide an average of £3,500 support for every household over this year and next – but the most important help we can give is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year so we get the economy growing again.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow Chancellor, said: “Today’s results are just another page in the book of failure that is the Tory record on growth. “The news of further economic pain will be deeply concerning to families already struggling with the soaring cost of living.”",UK economy unexpectedly grows in November,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/gdp-jeremy-hunt-rachel-reeves-institute-of-directors-b2261459.html

The UK's gross domestic product (GDP) - a key economic measure of services, construction and manufacturing output - rose by 0.1%. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said pubs and restaurants contributed to growth as people went out to watch World Cup games. However, in the three months to November, the economy shrank by 0.3%. The UK economy had been widely expected to contract in November. But the services sector, which includes a wide-range of industries from hospitality to shopping, was the biggest driver of growth that month. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, told the BBC: ""Business involved in telecoms and computer programmers did okay in November. ""Also interestingly employment agencies did reasonably well and perhaps that reflects those businesses seeking support to fill the vacancies they have which we know from our labour market figures has been an issue in certain sectors."" The ONS also said that there was ""anecdotal evidence"" to suggest that the FIFA World Cup had benefited some businesses such as pubs and restaurants as well as sales of wine and demand for pizza delivery. But overall, the new monthly figure represented a slowdown in growth, falling from a 0.5% increase in October when there was a bounceback from businesses shuttering to mark Queen Elizabeth II's funeral the month before.",UK economy beats expectations with November growth,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64238309?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

They want senior managers at tech firms to face two years in jail if they breach new duties over acceptable content, which includes posts promoting self-harm, depicting sexual violence or facilitating suicide. Labour is expected to support the amendment. Currently the proposed laws would only make bosses criminally liable for failing to give information to media regulator Ofcom and firms would face higher fines. Culture secretary Michelle Donelan has said she is “not ruling out” changes to legislation in the face of the major backbench rebellion. Dame Andrea said in its current form the bill is just asking companies “nicely” to protect children online. She told BBC Radio 4: “There should be this backstop that if you, as a senior tech director, or manager, knowingly allow harm to be caused that results in suicide, pornography, child abuse online and so on. “If you let that happen, there should be a backstop that you can be criminally prosecuted.” Dame Andrea added that in many other businesses, including in the financial and construction sectors, directors will face prosecution if their practices cause significant harm to someone.

The winning bids were revealed in a joint announcement by the UK and Scottish governments. The special economic zones north of the border are being created under a scheme agreed by the two governments. The successful applicants will be able to offer tax incentives and lower tariffs in the zones. A total of five bids for green freeport status were submitted, with North East Scotland, Orkney and Clyde missing out. Each had to set out how they would regenerate their area, create high-quality jobs and support transition to a net-zero economy. The Forth Green Freeport bid was led by Forth Ports, which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland. In submitting its bid, Forth Ports said it had the potential to create up to 50,000 new, high-quality jobs in renewable energy, manufacturing, sustainable fuels and construction. Its activities will focus on renewables, advanced manufacturing, alternative fuels, carbon capture utilisation and storage, shipbuilding, logistics and the creative industries. The Opportunity Cromarty Firth consortium - backed by Port of Cromarty Firth, Global Energy Group, Highland Resources and Port of Inverness - said it could create 25,000 jobs. The Inverness and Cromarty Firth bid aims to build a ""world-beating"" floating offshore wind manufacturing sector, with sites in the Cromarty Firth, Invergordon, Nigg and Inverness. Also called free trade zones, freeports are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in a zone receive tax waivers or tax breaks on National Insurance contributions, Land and Buildings Transactions Tax, business rates and capital allowances. The Scottish ""green freeport"" model includes commitments to meeting net zero targets and supporting fair work practices. The UK government has committed funding of £52m to the project and bidders had to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. Scotland's deputy first minister, John Swinney, described the creation of green freeports as a ""milestone achievement"". He said: ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport and Forth Green Freeport will support businesses to create high-quality, well-paid new jobs, promote growth and regeneration, and make a significant contribution to achieving our net zero ambitions. ""The successful applicants showed a strong determination to embed fair work practices, including payment of the Real Living Wage, and to enshrine net zero initiatives in their work. ""We look forward to working closely with them to ensure they deliver maximum positive impact and become operational as soon as possible."" The UK government's Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the green freeports would ""undoubtedly be transformative for future generations"". He added: ""Scotland has areas of outstanding opportunity but there are also places that can benefit from more investment to truly level up communities that have been overlooked. ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Firth of Forth are fantastic areas for these new green freeports to set up, ensuring the benefits are felt right across Scotland. ""This will help to create exciting new jobs, boost business and encourage investment in the local areas and beyond."" Scottish Renewables said it was pleased that the freeports would have green energy as a focus. Its head of energy transition and supply chain, Emma Harrick, said they would ""help Scotland compete on the international stage as offshore wind develops to become the mainstay of electricity generation in the UK"". The Scottish and UK governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border, after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later said they would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. The SNP's partners in government - the Scottish Greens - do not support the freeports, arguing they are likely to result in ""greenwashing"" rather than genuine action on sustainability. Greens MSP Ross Greer described freeports as a ""Thatcherite gimmick"" and voiced concern about potential abuse by criminals. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""We've consistently across the world seen freeports attract a lot of criminal activity, particularly money laundering and smuggling, because of the customs arrangements that are in place for them, because they are about deregulation, they are about making it 'easier', particularly for international trade."" Paul Swinney, director of policy research for think tank Centre for Cities, said it remained to be seen how much impact the new freeports would have. He said: ""With freeports, the government has dressed it up as saying we are going to make them into centres of innovation and hotbeds of new ideas. ""But the reality is that the tools that are that on offer make these schemes very attractive to low-skilled businesses rather than high-skilled businesses.""",Cromarty Firth and Forth to host first green freeports,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64248082?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Mr Thomson said: “I’m delighted to see a number of community groups and organisations benefit from funds which now rightly flow into coastal communities following the Scottish Government gaining control of the Crown Estate Scotland’s revenues. “I would encourage coastal communities and organisations with a link to the coast to consider how they could make use of the sums available.” Grants are being targeted at community groups, third sector organisations and small businesses on Aberdeenshire’s coastline, and can fund a range of activities with positive economic, social or environmental impacts. This year’s grants will be targeted towards activities or infrastructure which meet the following priorities: Supporting the development of active travel routes along, to and from the coastline. Developing the coastal economy and sustainable tourism. Creating or enhancing community, leisure and recreational facilities. Safeguarding, restoring or enhancing the coastal environment. Grants between £10,000 and £50,000 will be available, while applicants must make a minimum 10 per cent match funding contribution to projects. Small business applicants must contribute 50 per cent match funding. Due to budget conditions, all projects must be completed within the 2023-24 financial year.

The Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) bid is a collaboration of more than a dozen organisations representing industry, academia and the public sector around the Easter Ross and Inverness area. The aim is to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity in manufacturing, and from local and inward investment, innovation, skills development and employment. READ MORE: Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport officially confirmed by Scottish and UK Governments The OCF area has been highlighted as the main location for the UK to benefit from floating wind manufacturing. Reacting to the news, HIE’s chief executive Stuart Black, said: “We congratulate Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) on their successful bid. This is fantastic news. “Our collective belief in the region and the key ports’ capacity and capability to play an essential role in offshore wind and green hydrogen delivery has been confirmed by the dedication, commitment and resolve shown by the bid partners. ""This paves the way for even greater industry collaboration. The consortium’s physical assets, natural resources, experienced supply chain, and can-do people have proven to be a winning combination that can lead to future success. “The Highlands and Islands will play a critical role in meeting the challenging net zero targets at both Scotland and UK levels. Green freeport status for the Cromarty Firth will be a huge asset, driving collaboration between industry, academia and the public sector to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity, investment, innovation and skills development. “It will attract large-scale manufacturing and create thousands of green jobs that complement the skills of the local workforce and accelerate Scotland’s and the UK’s progress to achieving net zero targets. “A green freeport will also build on recent significant investments made in ports and harbours across the region and the historic and ongoing strengths here in energy, engineering and life sciences. “It will be a key enabler for supply chains of the future, rapidly accelerating domestic manufacturing capacity in an area with a long-standing industrial heritage. “We very much look forward to our region working in partnership with OCF, as we seek to secure maximum socio-economic impact, not just around the Cromarty Firth and Inverness but throughout many parts of the Highlands and Islands.” Sheelagh Cooley, real estate partner in the Edinburgh office of law firm Shoosmiths, also welcomed the successful bid. She said: “The confirmation of two green freeports in Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Forth represents an opportunity to drive forward new development, regeneration and economic growth in Scotland. “The potential impact of these projects, however, must not be limited to the immediate vicinity of the green freeports. Rather, true success hinges on the ability to also revitalise surrounding towns and cities, many of which are economically deprived. “In Inverness and Cromarty Firth, the introduction of a green freeport is said to have the potential to unlock £2.5bn of new private sector investment – creating up to 25,000 jobs. This is alongside developing wind power technology, with its port facilities already supporting offshore wind projects. “While the introduction of green freeports is governed by UK legislation, the model’s legislative structure is subject to devolved and reserved powers. The sites are intended to be secure custom zones where business can be carried out inside a land border, but where different custom and tax rules apply - offering various regulatory and financial incentives. “From a planning perspective, the green freeports are likely to operate under extended permitted development rights. Combined with a streamlining of the consenting process for development, this type of relaxed planning regime could, in theory, allow schemes – residential, commercial and infrastructure - to be brought forward at speed and avoiding certain barriers. “Unlike the UK government’s freeport model, and investment zone proposals, Scottish green freeports are subject to additional requirements, including on carbon neutrality and paying the real Living Wage. “The Forth green freeport could act as a catalyst for the manufacture of offshore wind turbines, shipbuilding and energy systems. It encompasses several ports, industrial and logistics sites, as well as Edinburgh Airport, with the consortium behind the bid outlining that it could lead to a boom in job creation and economic growth that is rooted in renewable energy and decarbonisation. “The successful bidders will now work with the Scottish and UK Government to determine a governance structure for each site. A process that must balance deregulation and economic growth with protecting the environment and assisting the transition to net zero. “Subject to compliance with the regulatory controls, green freeports should provide a welcome opportunity for growth in the Scottish economy, especially in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.” Dr Liz Cameron CBE, Chief Executive, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, also welcomed the award. She said: “It is great news for Scottish business that the UK and Scottish Governments have finally confirmed the sites of the two winning bids. It’s important now that both governments act swiftly to ensure that the successful sites are operational at the earliest opportunity, we are all competing to attract investment and trade. “Whilst it will be very disappointing for those areas who were not successful, we would urge both governments to now consider, in partnership with the business community, other incentives and initiatives which could be developed from the innovation demonstrated by the other bidders.” Professor Chris O’Neil, principal and chief executive of UHI Inverness, said: “The awarding of Green Freeport status to Inverness and Cromarty Firth will have a transformative impact on the economic fortunes of the community we serve. ""We are poised, together with our UHI partners, to meet the subsequent skills and knowledge demand. “We have the expertise in engineering, research, technology, design and construction to provide a highly-skilled and aspirational workforce, including trainees, apprentices, graduates and researchers. “As well as being well-placed to meet the associated need for talent, we also have the established industry links and capacity for knowledge exchange to make valuable collaborative contributions to the creation of a global green hub. “Our talented and committed students have proved their resilience by studying while coping with the consequences of a pandemic and then a cost-of-living crisis, and this announcement is significant in that it represents an improved future and enhanced opportunities for many of them. “Current and upcoming students will complete their learning journey knowing there is the potential for attractive employment on our doorstep in an expanding industry. These prospects will help retain local talent and will also appeal to a generation of students who are environmentally conscious and willing to embrace a sector that supports their values.” Do you want to respond to this article?

Josh Self,87322068,https://www.politics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PA-68183790.jpg,en,2023-01-13 16:13:37,-0.024,GB,"Rishi Sunak is a hyper-aware, even self-conscious prime minister. Since taking post in October, he has worked assiduously to present a “slick” image to the media, undertaken multiple U-turns to halt backbench rebellions and tried at every turn to position himself positively against Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer. The tricky technocrat in No 10 is obsessed with good press. It is an approach that bares stark contrast to the days of Liz Truss, who showed little concern for how her policies might be received amid her deeply misguided ideological crusade. Unlike his predecessor, therefore, you can take for granted that when Sunak announces a new policy, there will be a hefty amount of calculated politicking involved. In this way, November’s Autumn Statement was strategically orientated to exploit traditional Conservative strengths and traditional Labour weaknesses. Sir Keir, ever-keen to present Labour as a responsible party after the Cobrynite experiment, was challenged to disagree with Sunak’s proposals. In the end, Labour’s inability to sign up wholeheartedly to the new fiscal orthodoxy exposed, in chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s analysis, a deficit of common sense in Labour ranks. When it comes to the government’s new anti-strike bill, the political thinking is essentially the same. Setting a trap… The new anti-strike legislation was introduced to the House on Tuesday by business secretary Grant Shapps. Citing risks posed to NHS patients, Shapps outlined that the new bill would require public sector services to run minimum levels of provision on strike days — essentially forcing a certain proportion of an industry to work or face the sack. The move harks back to a “golden age” of Conservative power over industrial relations. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have viewed strikes as a way to make their party look tough and discredit the Labour Party alongside the wider left. To be sure, we have already seen Starmer encounter some political difficulty in this latest wave of industrial action. In the summer, he chose to sack one-time frontbencher Sam Tarry for standing alongside picketing workers. For the Labour leader — intent on distancing his party from the unions — Tarry had crossed a very literal red line. But even if Starmer wants to downplay the connection, there is no escaping the fact that the Labour party is associated politically and financially with the trade union movement. With the new anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak hopes to implicate Labour in an upsurge of union militancy, thus slowing Starmer’s inexorable march towards Downing Street. It was telling that ministers chose to announce the new strike legislation within hours of the Labour leader’s “New year, New Vision” speech last week. Shapps’ pledge stole Starmer’s limelight and Labour’s newly announced “take back control bill” secured a grand total of zero newspaper front pages the following day. The politics of the new legislation also dominated Starmer’s post-speech press conference. Under a barrage of questioning, the Labour leader confirmed that his party will vote against the plans and repeal the Act if he takes power at the next election. It was all going to plan for Sunak. He had goaded Starmer out of hiding and forced the Labour leader to share an ideological platform with that favourite Conservative bogeyman: the so-called union “baron”. The PMQs’ attack lines wrote themselves. However, few would deny that the prime minister is playing a high-stakes political game with his new anti-strike bill. Although Starmer’s reaction could be accounted for, the government risks running into a hostile public backlash. Now a week on from when the legislation was announced, and many view the new proposals as needlessly and deliberately obstructive. Risk 1: The government is viewed as needlessly obstructive Although Conservative MPs imagine Mick Lynch as the new Arthur Scargill, the infamous union “baron” who led opposition to Margaret Thatcher, the general public is not so convinced. Instead, the political posturing around the new anti-strike bill may be viewed as deepening the industrial relations crisis and prolonging our winter of discontent. Furthermore, the new bills’ parliamentary progress is set to be slow, with a difficult House of Lords stage beckoning. And when/if the bill does eventually pass, its key provisions will unquestionably be tested in the courts before they can take effect, just as is the case with deportations to Rwanda. So with the proposed legislation unlikely to do anything to solve urgent disputes, the public may well wonder want the point is at all — if not to be deliberately coercive and punitive. Risk 2: Labour exploits support for striking nurses Another risk for Sunak is that by focussing on risks posed to NHS patients during the strikes, he ventures onto territory where the Labour Party is traditionally at its strongest. It is telling that Starmer has focused his attacks on the part of the bill which would allow employers to sack workers who defy a “work notice” by striking. At PMQs on Wednesday, Starmer accused the government of going from “clapping the nurses to sacking the nurses”. On Thursday came a new widely-shared graphic by order of Labour Party HQ, which accused Sunak of planning to give striking nurses “the finger”, Alan Sugar-style. This attack line works because it is not very far from the truth. As a result of the proposed law, individual nurses could be prosecuted and even jailed. These are the same people Sunak was pictured clapping for, as chancellor, throughout the pandemic. Risk 3: Sunak is viewed as a rigid, uncompromising ideologue Sunak’s desire to be seen as pragmatic and “reasonable” may be fundamentally undermined by the passage of this bill. In pursuing the new legislation, Sunak has abandoned his “managerialism” and political prudence, territory where the risk-averse Starmer is comfortable, in order to set up a battle over principles, territory where Starmer is not. Honing in on fundamental Labour-Conservative differences in a bid to exploiting the Labour leader’s risk-averse nature, Sunak hence risks exposing the worst aspects of Conservative ideology. While the prime minister may point to a more conciliatory tone in negotiations, there is no hiding that the new law is an act of explicitly Thatcherite homage. It is as provocative and divisive as much as practically possible, drawing on Conservatism’s collective memory of disputes in the 1980s. However, you cannot help but think that in picking a fight with NHS nurses, Sunak has chosen the wrong moment to abandon his “problem-solving” priorities and get dug in with Conservative dogma. One recent YouGov poll found that 64% of the public support the striking nurses. Rather than introducing anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak’s political future may be better served by getting around the negotiating table and constructively ending the industrial dispute once and for all. So with imagery of nurses in handcuffs circling — and with ordinary Britons desperate for some degree of normalcy to return, Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes looks destined to fail.",Week-in-Review: Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes is destined to fail,https://www.politics.co.uk/week-in-review/2023/01/13/week-in-review-sunaks-attempt-to-trap-starmer-on-strikes-is-destined-to-fail/

As energy experts focused on how data can be used in the transition to a low-carbon economy, we have closely followed how this volatility has played out in Britain. Full data for the year 2022 is now available and here are a few things we have noticed. Britain (we talk about Britain and not the UK, as Northern Ireland is part of an integrated Irish electricity grid) saw a 4% drop in electricity demand from 2021 – that’s the third largest year-on-year reduction after 2008 (caused by the shock of the global financial crash) and pandemic-affected 2020. It takes Britain’s overall electricity demand back to values last seen in the 1980s, an 18% reduction from its peak in 2005. This time two years ago, we stated that COVID lockdowns meant electricity demand would never be so low again. We got it wrong. In fact, 2022 was the lowest year by some margin (2% lower than 2020). We believe the main factors for this drop were the significant increase in prices, the wider media attention on this, and the wider cost of living crisis. From importer to exporter The earliest undersea high-voltage direct current cable (known as an interconnector) from Britain to another country’s power grid was laid in 1961 across the Strait of Dover to France. In the years since, another seven have been constructed: two to Ireland, one to Belgium, one to the Netherlands, one to Norway and a further two to France. More interconnectors are under construction or proposed, including a connection with Denmark due to go live at the end of 2023. Since 1978, Britain has always used these cables to import more electricity than it exported over a given year. Over the past decade, an average of 5% of the country’s electricity has been imported, helping to reduce the amount it needed to generate itself. However, net imports swung to net exports in 2022 for the first time in 44 years. Looking at the individual interconnectors, it was the link to France that caused this significant change. In 2021, there were 14 terawatt-hours (TWh) of net imports from France whereas in 2022, there were 10 TWh to France. This is an enormous swing of 24 TWh from a single point of connection, and represents the largest annual change in a single electricity source since the shift from coal to gas in 2015/16. To put 24 TWh in context, this is broadly similar to the amount of electricity Scotland uses each year, or the annual output from Britain’s onshore wind generation. So what happened? Over the past year, French nuclear power stations had many maintenance problems which led to significant reductions in their output. In August, 57% of the country’s generation capacity was not being used. Despite a modest recovery, as of January 2023, 15 of its 56 reactors were closed for repairs. All this meant nuclear-reliant France had to import electricity from neighbouring countries. This led to more electricity being generated in Britain than would otherwise have been the case, to satisfy the additional demand from France. So while Britain’s renewable generation was at a record level, its fossil fuel generation was also higher than in the previous year. Without the problems in France, 2022 could have been the first year that Britain’s wind, solar and hydro combined generated more electricity than its fossil fuels – a milestone that will happen anyway over the next couple of years. Wind is cheap, but your electricity isn’t Wind generation also recovered from its relatively poor output in 2021 to reach a record generation of 77 TWh. That’s a 24% increase on the preceding year, when capacity increased by just 11%. This sudden increase highlights the year-to-year variations that need to be planned for to have a robust and resilient decarbonised power system, including longer duration energy storage. Renewables (including generation from biomass) contributed nearly 40% of Britain’s total generation in 2022. This progress, along with the lower demand for electricity within Britain, meant emissions from the power sector were broadly similar to previous years (though would have been lower if imports from France had continued). The rising prices of electricity and gas have contributed to a cost of living crisis, putting millions in fuel poverty. And though renewables and nuclear together provided over half of Britain’s electricity in 2022, the system is still overwhelmingly influenced by prices set by fossil fuel plants. Reforms are urgently needed here to decouple the price of low-carbon electricity from that of fossil fuels.",Britain is a net electricity exporter for first time in 44 years,https://theconversation.com/britain-is-a-net-electricity-exporter-for-first-time-in-44-years-197506

It was 1968 and she couldn’t wait to join the world of work, be independent and earn her own money. She was also joining the legions of women who’d recently entered the workforce. Not long after starting the job, Susan went on a site visit with her boss to a new shopping centre he had designed in Liverpool. It was a trip she made a number of times while she worked at the firm over the course of a year. But what seemed an unremarkable part of her job at the time would come back to haunt her 50 years later as, in 2018, Susan was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a deadly form of lung cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. And investigations have shown that during one of those visits to the construction site, lasting just a few hours, asbestos was being sprayed on the ceilings. ‘The diagnosis was quite a shock,’ says Susan, 78, who lives in Pershore, Worcestershire. ‘My parents both lived into their 90s and, as I had no illness or health conditions, my expectation was that I had a good few years’ ahead of me to enjoy life with my two sons and five grandchildren.’ Susan’s experience is becoming increasingly common. Latest figures from Cancer Research UK show that, while men account for most cases of mesothelioma, cases among women rose by 93 per cent between 1993 and 2018 (compared with 47 per cent in men). ‘The proportion of women being diagnosed with mesothelioma has never been higher,’ says Dean Fennell, a professor of thoracic medical oncology at the University of Leicester. ‘Given the disease can take decades to develop, this rise seems to coincide with when more women joined the workforce from the 1950s onwards.’ Roughly 2,700 people in the UK are diagnosed with mesothelioma every year. Asbestos, a flame retardant used in construction in the UK until 1999, is the main cause. Breathing in tiny asbestos fibres can damage the lungs and their lining (the mesothelium) although it can take years, even decades, for symptoms — breathlessness, coughing and chest pain — to develop. As these kinds of symptoms are common to a number of illnesses, mesothelioma is often misdiagnosed or not picked up until the cancer is advanced and treatment is more difficult. ‘Mesothelioma is a devastating and hard-to-treat disease with people often diagnosed at a late stage and typically facing a poor prognosis,’ says Liz Darlison, chief executive of the charity Mesothelioma UK. Mesothelioma mainly affects the lining of the lung rather than the lung itself, making it different from lung cancer (and asbestosis, which is non-cancerous scarring of the lung tissue caused by asbestos). There are six million tonnes of asbestos in 1.5 million UK buildings, including workplaces, public buildings — even schools — as well as homes, according to research published in 2019 by the think tank ResPublica. The Health and Safety Executive says it is potentially in any industrial or residential building built or refurbished before 2000. Susan first became aware of a problem in January 2018 when she found herself out of breath walking up the stairs at home. ‘It was unusual,’ she says. ‘I’ve kept myself in good shape — I was a yoga teacher for many years — and had never had lung problems. I didn’t think much of it as there were no other symptoms but, when it didn’t go away, I saw my GP. ‘He examined me and could find nothing wrong but said to come back if it persisted.’ Two weeks later, Susan went back to her GP and was sent for an X‑ray. She recalls: ‘As I was putting my coat on the radiographer rushed in and said, “You must go straight to A&E!” A doctor showed me the X-ray, indicating a collapsed lung and fluid in the chest cavity. I was hospitalised for a week so the fluid could be drained.’ Susan needed surgery to re‑inflate the lung but as the NHS couldn’t operate for six weeks, she used her health insurance to go private. ‘During the operation the surgeon took biopsies which revealed the mesothelioma diagnosis,’ says Susan. ‘He told me the average life expectancy for someone in my condition was 15 months. I was just so disappointed.’ Recent breakthroughs mean there are more treatment options for mesothelioma patients, says Professor Fennell: ‘For years we only had chemotherapy, but there’s been a lot happening in this area in the last couple of years which has led to advances in treatment. ‘Following successful trials, last year NICE [the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] approved the first new treatment in over ten years for patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma — which accounts for 90 per cent of cases.’ (This is the form that Susan has.) The treatment is ‘a type of immunotherapy, where we attempt to train the body to fight the disease itself, and is a combination of two drugs: nivolumab and ipilimumab. ‘It can be used now as a first-line treatment for these patients and trials show this gives patients a survival advantage of four months compared with chemotherapy alone.’ For patients whose cancers have grown after chemotherapy, nivolumab also improves survival — by over a month, according to data from the Cancer Research UK-funded CONFIRM trial, led by Professor Fennell. The NHS is now making nivolumab available to these patients. ‘This is a huge breakthrough as many patients only have months to live by the time they are diagnosed,’ says Professor Fennell. New research is focusing on trying to uncover why some mesothelioma patients respond better to treatment than others, by looking at their genes and microbiome, the community of microbes including bacteria that live in the gut. ‘If we can identify mesothelioma’s Achilles’ heel we could target treatments much more effectively,’ says Professor Fennell. Since her diagnosis, Susan has undergone two rounds of chemotherapy followed by nivolumab and ipilimumab — and most recently, in autumn 2022, radiotherapy to reduce pain. And she has done remarkably well. This month it will be five years since she was diagnosed — far exceeding the average life expectancy. ‘The frustrating thing is I am otherwise totally fit and have no other conditions,’ she says. ‘Once they had reinflated my lung, I didn’t really have any symptoms other than the side-effects of chemotherapy. Sadly immunotherapy didn’t work for me.’ But recent scans have shown that the cancer has spread to her ribs and diaphragm and Susan’s breathing is now more difficult. ‘I am still functioning — I can walk for short distances but have got myself a buggy to go to the shops,’ she says. ‘I find standing quite difficult and even the slightest movement has an effect on my breath. ‘I think I am in the last year now and I’ve taken the positive decision not to have more treatment, even though I was offered more chemotherapy and to go on a clinical trial. The benefits, if any, are small and I want to focus on quality of life,’ she says. ‘I have a wonderful GP who is dedicated and the local hospice nurse looks after me both physically and psychologically. All along I have had this overwhelming feeling of disappointment but now, as the end isn’t far off, I am angry.’ Investigations by a solicitor, which included getting hold of original construction notes for the shopping centre, showed with some certainty that it was those site visits in Liverpool more than 50 years ago which had caused Susan’s disease, and she received a payout in 2021 from the Government’s mesothelioma compensation scheme. ‘I want people to be aware that mesothelioma is not just an industrial disease, linked to the building sector — it affects normal people like me who never realised they were putting themselves at risk,’ says Susan. ‘And it is still present in a huge number of hospitals, schools and other public buildings. ‘One woman I know developed it after going into a cellar at school to pick up some files, another from washing overalls belonging to her husband, a builder. He didn’t get mesothelioma, but she did. ‘Research into mesothelioma lags behind many other cancers. We need to put more money into it to find a cure for this disease, not just pay out compensation to those who develop it.’ To donate to research into mesothelioma, visit junehancockfund.org",How cases of deadly asbestos cancer are rising in women,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11592963/How-cases-deadly-asbestos-cancer-rising-women.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490

Here, we look at all the exhibitions locals and visitors alike will be able to see at the popular Schoolhill venue. These include exhibitions which opened in 2022 but will remain in the gallery for some part of 2023. Pavlovka Pinhole Photography Festival (until February 12) The Pavlovka Pinhole Festival was established in 2017 in Kyiv, Ukraine, to celebrate the playfulness, surprise and magic of pinhole photography. Organised by curator Yuliia Belska, the festival aims to unite international photo artists who use the world’s oldest photographic tradition in their work. Jerwood Art Fund Makers Open (until March 5) A collaboration between Jerwood Arts and Art Fund in partnership with Aberdeen Art Gallery, the exhibition celebrates work by early-career artists and makers Anna Berry, Cecilia Charlton, Jahday Ford, Vicky Higginson, Francisca Onumah and Helena Russell. Showcasing a broad range of material disciplines, including glass, textiles, silversmithing and sculptural installation, the five commissions provide a snapshot of some of the most exciting new work being produced by UK-based artists and makers. Lilli Geissendorfer, Jerwood Arts’ director, said: “Jerwood Art Fund Makers Open creates a vital space for early-career artists and makers to experiment, learn, and take risks with their work. “We have been delighted to co-fund a dedicated curatorial role held by Svetlana Panova to guide this project, investing in essential talent development opportunities in the curatorial sector.” Shadows and Light – The Extraordinary Life of James McBey (February 11 – May 28) The celebrated Aberdeenshire-born artist and adventurer James McBey (1883-1959) was noted for his etchings and dry point engravings, and was once described as the “heir to Rembrandt”. This small-scale exhibition is curated by author Alasdair Soussi to coincide with his recently-published biography of McBey. The author’s research drew on the unparalleled archive of the artist’s personal collection of artworks, sketchbooks, scrapbooks, diaries and letters in the Archives, Gallery & Museums’ collection, a selection of which will be on display. Alasdair Soussi will give a talk at Aberdeen Art Gallery on Saturday April 15. Travelling Gallery (March) The contemporary gallery in a bus will be parked up in Aberdeen with a new two-person exhibition by artist Emmie McLuskey and choreographer Janice Parker which explores movement, bringing dance and people together in different ways and art forms. Look out for Travelling Gallery in locations across the city in March. The Testament of Alexander Jaffray (March 4 – September 3) 2023 marks the 350th anniversary of the death of Alexander Jaffray, twice provost of Aberdeen and representative of the burgh in the Scottish Parliament. This prominent member of the community later became a Quaker, at a time when doing so would mean persecution. This exhibition uses the manuscript of Jaffray’s last testament, acquired by Aberdeen City & Aberdeenshire Archives in 2022, as the starting point for a closer look at the man himself and the persecution. Where Ideas Are Born – an exhibition by Magnum Photos (April 1 – June 11) This exhibition brings together works by over 20 photographers from the celebrated Magnum agency, including Inge Morath, Eve Arnold and Robert Capa. Around 70 photo portraits of internationally renowned artists capture the moment in their studios. Making a Splash! A Century of Women’s Beachwear (June 10 – January 14 2024) Seaside fashions have been influenced by social and political change, the film industry and innovations in design and materials. This exhibition showcases bathing costumes and other highlights from the Archives, Gallery & Museums’ collection of 20th-century beachwear. Quentin Blake – Illustrating Verse and Book Covers (July 8 – September 17) Two exhibitions under one roof at the Art Gallery will celebrate the unique talent of Quentin Blake, the UK’s best-loved illustrator, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday. Illustrating Verse brings together for the first time a selection Blake’s sketches and illustrations for a range of poetry, from comic nonsense poems to poignant ballads by writers including William Shakespeare and Roald Dahl. Book Covers demonstrates how Blake’s illustrations have grabbed the attention of readers of all ages over the past 60 years. The exhibition includes reproductions of cover artwork and rough sketches which give insights into Blake’s unmistakable and ever-popular way of working. Constructed Narratives: Lennox Dunbar, Ian Howard, Arthur Watson (October 14 – January 28 2024) This exhibition brings together three of Scotland’s foremost artists – Lennox Dunbar, Ian Howard and Arthur Watson. The Aberdeen-born contemporaries were educated at Aberdeen Grammar School, where art teacher Charles Hemingway encouraged them to spend time with the collection of contemporary art at Aberdeen Art Gallery. All three have key early works in the Aberdeen Art Gallery collection, which will be displayed here along with more recent pieces. Over their careers Dunbar, Howard and Watson have exhibited extensively across Europe, the United States and Asia, both together and as solo artists. Provost Skene’s House in 2023 More than 100 remarkable individuals from Aberdeen and the north-east are showcased in new interactive displays. They include innovators, scientists, live savers, writers, sporting champions and stars of stage and screen.

The Tolbooth Museum – temporarily closed The museum hasn’t reopened since it was shut at the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown in March 2020. A large crack had been discovered in an archway on the ground floor, risking the health and safety of visitors. As more investigations were carried out, more problems were found, including rusting metal embedded in the stonework. Councillors gave the go-ahead to all the necessary works, which would total £1.36 million, in early December. Click here for more information. Aberdeen Maritime Museum – temporarily closed Aberdeen Maritime Museum tells the story of the city’s long relationship with the sea. The venue closed in late November and will remain closed until spring 2023 while “essential repairs and maintenance” is carried out.

It's the opportunity of a lifetime for a business owner, and the 18 entrepreneurs are all hoping to win the £250,000 cash injection and invaluable advice from Lord Sugar. The full line-up for the show has been released ahead of it's return on Thursday and this year's looks more entertaining than ever before. This year's group features nine men and nine women who will all do their best to impress Lord Sugar and his advisors, Baroness Karren Brady, Tim Campbell and Claude Littner. The hit BBC show is now in its 17th season, and marks the first in person launch since 2019 due to the Covid pandemic. It began in 2005 as a groundbreaking show which featured some of the country's best young business minds hoping to secure a job with the then Sir Alan. However the programme has slowly turned into a more reality TV-inspired fare, with big personalities gloating irreverently about their skills in business. Among them are two sweetshop owners, two hairdressers, a martial arts instructor, and a pest control company owner and they will be put through their paces through a series of tricky tasks, with the first set in Antigua. The 20th anniversary of the series will air next year, with Lord Sugar saying he would do 20 years and then retire, having invested over £3million of his own money over the years. Meet all 18 candidates hoping to secure an investment for their business ideas. AVI SHARMA 'Some say I'm delusional, I prefer the term optimistic.' Avi is this year's youngest candidate, and works as a city banker in London. He describes himself as 'confident' and 'optimistic' and says he can 'bring a smile to the most miserable face!' He wants Lord Sugar's investment to help get him out of the 'rat race' of a banking job, boasting: 'I'm the hardest working rat he'll ever meet.' BRADLEY JOHNSON 'I have a business plan that will see us turn over seven figures after year three and who knows where else that could take us.' Bradley is a self-made businessman, who is the director of a construction company in North Yorkshire. He prides himself on his work ethic and drive which he claims has allowed him to create a business that turns over half-a-million after being made redundant just four years ago. He admits that his biggest weakness is public speaking, confessing: 'I was always the shy kid at school, I hated having to stand up and read in English lesson'. DANI DONOVAN 'My biggest weakness is also my biggest strength.' Dani owns a hair salon in Hertfordshire, which she started as a teenager and believes the key to business is 'passion'. She says she has a 'unique' personality and describes herself as 'a different kind of business owner, which is a lot more relatable to people.' Her self-confessed weakness, is 'that nothing is ever good enough and that I always want more. This is a weakness because then I'm never content with what I have achieved. But it's also a humongous strength – it is what has pushed me to come so far.' She believes she deserves to win the programme because her business fills a 'huge gap' in the market, saying: 'It baffles me that no one has done it yet!' DENISHA KAUR BHARJ 'I have always known what I wanted in life. I know the dreams I want to achieve. There's only one Denisha Kaur.' Denisha works as a financial controller in Leicestershire and says she's not afraid of getting out of her comfort zone. She describes herself as 'strong, motivated and hard-working' and says she can work under pressure, overcoming both professional and personal tests to reach success. Denisha says she wants the investment opportunity because she wants to 'be mentored by the best to be the best.' She argues she deserves it, because: 'I'm a woman who wants to create an empire and have it all; to be able to provide for my family and to be an inspiration to young women. I dream big, but I work extra hard and know everything is possible.' EMMA BROWNE 'I am disgustingly competitive. I will go to any lengths to win this investment.' Emma is a senior account executive in County Kildare and says she is 'extremely competitive' and a 'workaholic' who will 'do anything succeed'. She has over five years of hands-on sales experience and says she wants to ensure she will win tasks by being honest about her opinions. Describing her business idea, she says: 'I am confident that whether I win the investment from Lord Sugar or not, I am going to make my company one of the most successful ideas to ever come out of The Apprentice. Watch this space. GREGORY EBBS 'My biggest weakness, some could call a strength in my opinion, is sometimes being a little too unusual.' Gregory is the owner of an online antiques marketplace based in Shropshire and is also a local coucillor, while he previously worked as a professional cannon-firer. He says his USP is 'my ability to think outside the box and try out new and different things' and confesses to being 'slightly more unusual than most'. He says: 'I would say, a willingness to try different things and not being afraid to be slightly different is one of my biggest strengths. Speaking on his business idea, Gregory said: 'I think the chances of making this business super successful is greater than anybody else’s, because it’s such a fantastic principle.' JOSEPH PHILLIPS 'If Lord Sugar wants to invest in a business to help save the ocean, one lip balm at a time, then I’m his guy.' Joseph is a safari guide in South Africa, from Worcestshire and he believes that gives him the edge to be 'unique enough to succeed in the process', describing himself as the 'James Bond of the business world'. He admits that his biggest weakness is his dyslexia and say he 'struggled to keep my head above water' at school and keep up with his peers. But Joseph said the diagnosis has now become a driving force to succeed and go further as he wanted to prove that you can still be anything you want to be with dyslexia. He graciously adds: 'I don’t deserve Lord Sugar’s investment more than anyone else in the process, but I do think I have something that they don’t.' KEVIN D'ARCY 'With Lord Sugar as my business partner, I know we can ride that wave into the UK and beyond…' Kevin is an accountant from Dublin who began his water sports equipment business during lockdown while juggling his job. He claims his business has turned over just under half a million in two years and says that combined with his 10-year career in financial service sets him apart from the rest. Kevin admits his biggest weakness to be: 'I can be a little outspoken, so probably not knowing when to shut up.' MARK MOSELEY 'If Lord Sugar doesn’t pick me, then he’s missing a trick.' Mark is the owner of a pest control company in London, arguing that Lord Sugar can invest because the industry is worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year in the UK. He is also a former soldier who has worked all over the world in remote and hostile environments, meaning he should be right at home in the boardroom. He describes himself as 'very talkative with the charm to match – I can sell to anyone' and claims to have met celebrities and members of the royal family. Mark confesses he can be 'a little bit over-confident from time to time' but explains that 'people buy into confidence'. MARNIE SWINDELLS 'I have fought tooth and nail to get to where I am today with my business.' Marnie is a court advocate in London who is also a gold medal-winning boxer and imaginative businesswoman who is ready to face off against the other candidates. She says her USP is her 'imagination and creativity' but admits her passion and eagerness can sometimes translate as being too 'headstrong'. She says she deserves Lord Sugar's investment because: 'I think that taking the experience I have in the boxing industry and all the experience that he has in the business industry, together we would be a winning combination.' MEGAN HORNBY 'I think that no matter what situation I am thrown into, I will always give one hundred percent truth, even if it’s hard to hear.' Megan is the owner of a sweet shop and café in East Yorkshire and says her business has a 'real niche' in a gap in the market. She says her biggest asset is her honesty, saying it's the 'most important thing in business'. Her biggest weakness is her ambition, confessing: 'I can take too many things on, and sometimes I need to focus on certain aspects.' She says she should have the £250k because: 'I really think that with Lord Sugar’s investment, my business could be nationally recognised'. REECE DONNELLY 'I'm going to be turning over a million pounds before I’m thirty.' Reece is the owner of a performing arts school in Glasgow who is determined to become the first Scottish candidate to secure Lord Sugar's investment. He says he is the youngest CEO of a further education college in the UK and says he has 'all the experience, drive, and personality' to succeed. He admits that he can be guilty of neglecting the grunt work, saying: 'Admin or accounting tasks aren’t quite for me' but that this makes him a better leader who is able to delegate. Reece says he wants to prove: 'Scotland is filled with forward-thinking entrepreneurs and that we are not in fact a haggis-eating, kilt-wearing nation.' ROCHELLE ANTHONY 'I’m always being compared to the Kim Kardashian of the business world because I’m doing business with a hint of glam.' Rochelle owns a hair salon and academy in Bedfordshire and has compared herself to Kim Kardashian in the business world. She describes herself as 'tenacious, fierce and determined' and says together with Lord Sugar they would be 'an absolute force to be reckoned with.' According to Rochelle, her biggest weakness is she doesn't like the word 'no' and can't let go, instead turning it into a 'not yet', but learns from her mistakes. SHANNON MARTIN 'Lord Sugar needs to be my next business partner, so I can make him millions.' Shannon is the owner of bridal boutique from West Yorkshire and is hoping to be the first business partner to bring Lord Sugar into the lucrative bridal industry. She admits she struggles to prioritise and plan because 'I want everything now' and that it can cause a bit of stress. She believes she deserves the investment because: 'There are not many other businesses that design, and manufacture wedding dresses made solely in the UK, which is exactly what my business plan is.' SHAZIA HUSSAIN 'I don’t need any friends in business. I am here to win this.' Shazia is a technology recruiter in London and wants to inspire a varied representation of diverse women in the world of business. She says her ADHD is both her USP and biggest weakness, saying she can process information faster, react quicker and see things differently, but can lose concentration quickly. She says she should get the win because: 'It’s important to see a varied representation of women, including women with neurodiversity in business, as people with neurodiversity are linked to being increasingly successful within the corporate sector. I hope that I’ll encourage more people like me not to be ashamed of their difference.' SIMBA RWAMBIWA 'My USP is myself. If people can’t buy into you, they’ll never buy anything from you.' Simba is a senior sales representative from Birmingham and says he's a perfectionist as he always wants to 'get things right'. He says he deserves the investment opportunity because his business guarantee prpfit, 'but also guarantees to improve the quality of peoples’ lives'. SOHAIL CHOWHARY 'I am calm and collected, but if they do come at me? I will bite and I will sting, and I will leave my mark.' Sohail owns a martial arts school in Southampton and wants the otehr candidates to be 'wary' of him. He says his biggest asset is 'turning my laziness into a positive by creating smart solutions and simple shortcuts to difficult problems.' He admits his biggest weakness is not listening to others when 'on the very rare occasion I might be wrong' but says: 'I’ll always be the person that looks out for the little guy and sometimes that means that I will put emotions before business.' Sohail is proud to have grown up in a council house and worked his way up and adds: 'Owning a martial arts business means Lord Sugar can learn how to kick ass for free.'

Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers.

Around half of Britain’s railway lines are closed and only a fifth of services are running as tens of thousands of workers at Network Rail and train operators walk out on the second day of the strike with bus drivers joining them. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction and said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline,” he wrote. Transport for London has revealed that bus strikes will take place today and tomorrow on Abellio bus services. There will still be buses available on the affected routes in south and west London, but not in their usual numbers. Meanwhile, industrial action by the UK-wide National Highways and Rural Payments Agency staff will continue. Recommended Who’s on strike today?

It wasn’t until this past year watching Musk, Johnson, Trump, King Charles, Truss, Clarkson (who is not out of the woods, however much cover The Sun give him) etc that it occurred to me that, if you are patient enough and prepared to witness massive collateral damage and waste of resources and unnecessary heartache, worsening socio-economic inequality and the debasement of living conditions for the most vulnerable – “they” implode...

Rishi Sunak has been warned that his “high risk” strategy on public sector pay rises could backfire, as an exclusive poll for The Independent showed strong public support for fresh strikes in 2023. Almost two in three voters would back NHS nurses taking more strike action next year if their pay demands are not met, the Savanta poll found, with only 24 per cent opposed. In addition, more voters expressed support for fresh industrial action by rail staff, bus drivers, postal workers and teachers than those who said they were opposed to further strikes. Adam Forrest reports: What does Britain really think about the strikes? As unions and government continue their stand-off, voters are still backing the workers who have chosen to walk out, polling finds – and they support more strikes in the new year, Adam Forrest reports Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 02:48 1672796880 As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be a good year for the unions After decades when it was – sadly – usually safe to ignore the pronouncements of union leaders, the most widespread outbreak of industrial action since 1979 has meant that they are household names once again. Not yet as familiar as, say, Mick Lynch, is the brand new general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, who formally takes over from Frances (now Baroness) O’Grady on 1 January. He is, though, making a somewhat loud entrance. He told The Independent that the strikes could carry on throughout 2023 if the government refuses to negotiate over pay rises. If we take ministers at their word, that they won’t do so until at least the new public pay body recommendations arrive in April, then the country is in for a prolonged period of conflict. Writes Sean O’Grady: As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be good for the unions The economic reality is on the side of the unions, and Rishi Sunak lacks Thatcher’s sharp political instinct, writes Sean O'Grady Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 01:48 1672793280 I’m a nurse – this is why I voted to strike Ever since I was a young child, I dreamt of being a nurse that worked for the NHS. Twelve years ago, after lots of hard work and determination, I achieved that goal. There were lots of sacrifices from my family, who supported me throughout my course. I currently work as a deputy sister in an NHS hospital in Lincolnshire. My role is as part of an acute cardiology team that has face to face contact with patients that attend the hospital after having heart attacks and following cardiac arrests.

Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 23:34 1672786137 Who is striking this winter and why? Workers in several of Britain’s key service sectors are striking in what is being called the new “winter of discontent” as cost of living pressures clash with below-inflation pay offers. Many strikes, such as that of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), have been going on for months, with warnings union members will vote to take their fight far into 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the highest monthly total since November 2011 saw mass public sector walkouts over pension reforms. Liam James reports: Who is striking this winter and why? Workers are walking out in droves over the coming weeks Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 22:48 1672783170 Bus strikes planned for Wednesday TfL has said that strike are planned for Wednesday and Thursday on Abellio bus services. On the strike days, TfL writes that they intend to run as many services as possible, but expect disruption. Routes affected by the strikes are, for the most part, in west and south London. Other bus services will not be affected.

The wild salmon is one of Scotland’s most iconic species, earning its place alongside the red deer, the golden eagle, and the Scottish wildcat. But, like so many other animals, its numbers have been in decline for decades. The population of wild salmon is diminishing on the west coast of Scotland, and even faster on the east coast. Reasons for the fall are many and varied, but a key cause is habitat loss and rising river temperatures, due to climate change. The Scottish Government has also identified other pressures facing wild salmon, including predation by fish, birds and seals, as well as the non-native plans that erode riverbanks. Man-made barriers to migration, such as weirs and bridge foundations, lead to further challenges for the fish, impeding their migration to spawning grounds and increasing the likelihood of them being eaten. The sad truth is that a wild Atlantic salmon now has a miniscule survival rate of only around 1-2%. That contrasts sharply with farm-raised salmon, where the survival rate is around 85% over their two years in the cold seas off Scotland’s west coast. Daily animal husbandry from our salmon farmers, supported by the best vets in the land, has developed world-leading expertise in hatching and rearing salmon that thrive at sea. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part There are a handful of vocal activists, often from urban centres far from rural Scotland, determined to shut down salmon farms – which would make 12,000 people unemployed amid a cost of living crisis – who mistakenly believe that this would somehow help wild salmon. They have no explanation, of course, for the fact that wild salmon numbers are declining at the same rate on the east coast, where there has never been any salmon farming. What is needed is collaboration, not confrontation. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part in finding solutions, engaging constructively with the wild fish sector, and taking meaningful action to save wild salmon. They are determined, for example, to share their knowledge and experience to support wild fisheries with restocking. Fortunately, most people in the fisheries and angling sectors in the Highlands and Islands recognise the importance of a healthy, shared environment, ensuring fish can thrive in our waters. People like Jon Gibb, a fisheries manager based in Fort William, get that. He has long championed a constructive relationship between the farm-raised salmon sector and fisheries and angling groups, arguing that “both the farmed and wild salmon sectors have a common interest to thrive in our shared space”. I agree, which is why I’m delighted that Jon has agreed to coordinate our revamped £1.5 million “wild fisheries fund”, which is paid for directly by Scotland’s salmon farming companies. Funding to protect our salmon heritage The Scottish salmon sector has already funded projects to save and restore a historic dam in the Western Isles that assists wild salmon to progress to their spawning grounds, as well as restoration projects across Scotland that will reduce riverbank erosion and provide tree canopy and in-stream cover for young salmon. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks In the coming year, £145,000 will be available to a broad range of organisations and projects. Applications are invited from fisheries organisations, including local angling clubs, fishery boards and other community associations. The revamped fund will prioritise applications of a practical nature, which aim to protect and enhance wild salmon populations and local angling opportunities, recognising that salmon and trout fishing is at the cultural heart of many Highland communities, and provides human health benefits. Projects could include removing migration barriers, evidence-based and authorised restocking programmes, hatchery-based operations using contemporary techniques, such as genetic screening, and freshwater habitat improvement, like spawning gravel creation. Money is also available for improvements to angling facilities, including riverside paths, boats and buildings, as well as initiatives to support young and disabled anglers. Scottish salmon is part of our national story. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks. We recognise that today’s Scottish salmon farming sector enjoys its strong reputation and success partly due to this heritage. It is in all of our interests to ensure that we protect our freshwater and seawater environment so that one of Scotland’s most iconic species can recover and thrive.

Hardies Property & Construction Consultants is currently renovating its offices in the city. Once the offices on Albert Square are ready, bosses plan to have staff from Hardies and its sister company Shepherds working under the same roof. They will be joined by workers from the recently-acquired John Duguid Partnership. Hardies investment in Dundee offices Gareth Cordiner, the firm’s north division managing partner, believes this will make a real difference. He said: “It’s hugely important especially after Covid. We do have a flexible working policy but we’ve found people want to be back in the office and back together. “The amount of information you share from hearing it across the room, it makes a big difference. “From a mental health point of view it’s brilliant. You see relationships building again, so there’s huge benefits.” Douglas Smith, who was appointed Dundee partner recently, added: “We’ll have our one-stop-shop under one roof and that’s really exciting. “It needs to be a more modern way, with collective thinking.” Mr Smith also outlined his ambition for Hardies to become the go-to business for anyone’s surveying requirements in Dundee. “It’s a pretty exciting time for Hardies in Dundee,” he said. “We’ve got a fairly big team that are looking to make giant strides in the Tayside area moving forward. “We’re trying to build the Hardies brand. “In Dundee, we’re trying to make it a one-stop shop surveying service across all disciplines – building surveying, quantity surveying, you name it, we’re doing it. “We’re going to target sectors we want to work in.” Tayside offices crucial for Hardies Mr Cordiner said its presence in Tayside and Fife – the firm also has offices in Dunfermline, St Andrews and Perth – are key to the business. He added: “Dundee and Perth work closely together as the Tayside region. “Historically in Dundee quantity surveying-wise, we’re historically very strong and very well known. “Joining up with the John Duguid Partnership we’re keen that we become the strongest quantity surveying team in Tayside. “I don’t think we’re far off that at the moment.” Mr Smith said the firm’s progress would be based on “considered and selective movement”.",Dundee property firm looking to make &#8216;giant strides&#8217; in Tayside,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/business-environment/business/4001080/hardies-dundee/

On Wednesday, around half of Britain’s railway lines are closed and only a fifth of services are running as tens of thousands of workers at Network Rail and train operators walk out on the second day of a 48-hour strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT). Train drivers in the Aslef union will strike on Thursday before a second two-day RMT strike begins on Friday. TUC leader Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing”. He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. “We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love. And so our public services can start to improve for everyone who relies on them.” RMT general secretary Mick Lynch warned on Tuesday that industrial action will need to continue beyond May unless a reasonable offer to resolve the row over pay, jobs and conditions is made to the union.

British wrestler Zack Sabre Jr, who has been vocally anti-Tory in the past, stepped out for a high stakes match at New Japan Pro Wrestling’s (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom 17 event in front of a packed Tokyo Dome crowd. With a global audience tuning in to see former WWE superstar Sasha Banks make her heavily rumoured debut, the 35-year-old grappler took his opportunity to shine a light on the action being taken by the Royal College of Nursing (RNC). Back in November, for the first first time in its 106 year history the RNC voted in favour of strikes, as walkouts affected hospitals across the country with more set to take place on January 18 and 19. Zack has joined those criticising the government over the dispute, and he sent a very blunt message for the Prime Minister as he made his entrance on Wednesday (January 4). Looking straight down the camera, he said: ‘Hey Rishi Sunak! Pay nurses, d**khead! Pay nurses a living wage!’ Zack has a message for the prime minister pic.twitter.com/ECbWf0EX1O— Elijah (@eli1ah) January 4, 2023 Zack Sabre Jr has fans around the world (Picture: Etsuo Hara/Getty Images) Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said last month that the union had ‘no choice’ but to arrange the upcoming strikes. She said: ‘The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January. ‘The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.’ The union is campaigning for a five percent pay rise above inflation to help nurses overcome those real-terms pay cuts, to support nursing staff through the cost of living crisis and recognise their critical skills. There are also record nursing vacancies, with 25,000 nursing staff having quit in the past year, but Mr Sunak previously said while the government was open to talks, a demand for a 19% pay rise wasn’t affordable. He told BBC News NI in December: ‘The health secretary has always been clear that his door is always open for talks – we want to be reasonable, we want to be constructive. ‘We’ve got enormous gratitude for all public sector workers for the job they do, and I know things are difficult right now.’ Got a story?

Al-Quds reported that they had been deported for a range of reasons, including drug abuse, theft, expiration of residency and acting against the public interest. Egyptians are the largest expat group in Kuwait, constituting 24 per cent of the workforce, though that number looks set to reduce as the government works on controlling the labour market and reducing the number of expats across all sectors, particularly within the government. In 2018 Kuwait's Civil Service Commission issued a decree to replace expats in government jobs with Kuwaitis over the next five years. Since then, authorities have rolled out a series of measures aimed at reducing foreign workers in the country. In 2020 Kuwait's parliament said it wanted to reduce the number of Egyptians in the country to ten per cent and introduced a draft law to that effect. In December this year the Kuwaiti government imposed new conditions on Egyptian workers wishing to travel to the Gulf State including a $100 entry fee, an increased work permit documentation fee and a medical examination. READ: Kuwait: death sentence for man who killed woman who refused his advances At the time, Deputy Prime Minister Talal Al-Khaled suspended a 2018 memorandum of understanding which was originally signed to facilitate recruitment between the two countries but did not officially inform Egypt it was being terminated. Four months earlier Kuwait announced that it would lay off 250,000 Egyptian workers and suspend all contracts with non-nationals as 500,000 other Egyptians were already set to lose their jobs. Egyptians have suffered racism in the Gulf country with a video of a Kuwaiti customer slapping an Egyptian cashier two years ago going viral. One influencer called Egyptians ""filthy servants."" Even though they are the largest expatriate group in Kuwait, Egyptians lack employment rights and safety provision. In November last year an Egyptian construction worker was killed in Kuwait allegedly after his colleagues dumped rubbish on him from the third floor after not realising he was below them. A 2015 report on migrant rights found that industry corruption, including overextending project timelines and using cheap materials, put construction workers at risk.

Members of Aslef in 15 train operators will walk out, leaving large parts of the country with no trains all day. Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan told the PA news agency it was “inevitable” that further strikes will be held unless there is a breakthrough to the long running row. He warned that strikes could escalate, saying train drivers wanted to go “harder and faster” after years of not receiving a pay rise. His comments came as train passengers suffered more disruption on Wednesday because of the second day of a 48 hour stoppage by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) in a separate dispute over pay, jobs and conditions. Another RMT 48 hour strike will start on Friday, ending a week of travel chaos on the railways, On Wednesday, around half of Britain’s railway lines were closed and only a fifth of services ran as tens of thousands of RMT members at Network Rail and 14 train operators walked out. Mr Whelan told PA he felt rail employers and the Government were “playing games” rather than making any serious attempt to resolve the pay dispute. “The situation is getting worse and my members now want to go harder and faster because of the lack of progress. “We are in a weird world where the Government will do anything to keep private companies in the industry. “It is inevitable that more strikes will be held and probably escalate. “The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us. “We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing, and that is unacceptable.” Among the operators which will run no trains all day on Thursday are Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Northern, Southern, Southeastern, Thameslink and TransPennine Express. Rail links to the UK’s two busiest airports will be cut, with Gatwick Express and Heathrow Express shutting down. Areas where trains will run on Thursday include: Wales; the Central Belt, Fife and the Borders of Scotland; and parts of the South Western Railway network. Services will also operate on London Overground and the Elizabeth line. Around 20% of normal services will run, according to the Rail Delivery Group. Companies affected by the strike are Avanti West Coast; Chiltern Railways; CrossCountry; East Midlands Railway; Great Western Railway; Greater Anglia; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; London North Eastern Railway; Northern Trains; Southeastern; Southern/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway (depot drivers only); SWR Island Line; TransPennine Express; and West Midlands Trains.

Next, we need to stop seeing education is something that ends at age 18 or that sees university as the only option with more technical education, lifelong learning and apprenticeship,” he said. We're holding the first BUSINESSiQ Awards - to nominate someone, CLICK HERE He told an audience in Stratford: “One of the biggest changes in mindset we need in education today is to reimagine our approach to numeracy. Right now, just half of all 16 to 19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills, is letting our children down.” Rishi Sunak (Image: PA) Grant Glendinning, Chief Executive and Group Principal at Education Training Collective (Etc.), replied: “I fully agree with the Prime Minister, opportunity is intrinsically linked with education – ensuring that learners have access to the best possible learning experiences. However, while maths, and English, are important and critical foundations of any education pathway towards employment, they do not work in isolation. ""Skills as a whole, starting with English and maths, developed from primary into secondary education, supported by additional learning and development in further education or in the workplace as part of an apprenticeship or T Level, are what will see our young people best positioned to take advantage of the careers and opportunities they pursue, supporting the economic growth of our country. Grant Glendinning (Image: Press release) It will be interesting to understand how this will be rolled out, but with the best interests of our learners and our communities firmly at the heart of Etc. colleges, it is difficult to see how enhanced skills development can be anything but a positive.” Zoe Lewis, Principal and Chief Executive of Middlesbrough College, told us: ""The UK is one of the few developed nations that reduces the time spent in education from around 25 hours per week from the age of 5 to 16 years old to around 16 hours per week between the ages of 16 and 18. Zoe Lewis (Image: Press release) ""We would welcome any opportunity to increase the hours available to continue the development of key skills required for life and the workplace in our young people, whether this be mathematics, English, digital, physical education or employability skills. ""Whilst we would not necessarily single out mathematics from the list of priority skills, we would very much support any increase in investment between in the ages of 16 and 18, alongside a clear plan as to how we can develop and train the increased numbers of teachers that would be required, in light of the current shortages across the sector."" Henri Murison, Chief Executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership said businesses needed young people who were ready for work: ""The Prime Minister is right to be concerned about the progress made by disadvantaged children in this country,"" he said. ""It is simply not good enough that 60% of children do not receive a high enough grade at GCSE in maths to make it on to a T-Level course or other vocation routes to further study. Henri Murison (Image: Press release) ""However it's worth noting that already many young people are studying maths post 16 through resits, in order to get the grade they need to make it through to the system to achieve a higher level of skills.

""The schools minister also needs to sort out funding for disadvantaged children - starting off by reversing the cuts to opportunity areas.

After the disappointments of the previous decade, this was to be the time when the global economy powered up and got going again. There would be a flowering of new technologies and a colossal boom. It would be the roaring 20s all over again. It hasn’t worked out like that. Instead, the world faces the grim prospect of a second recession in three years. The three biggest economies – the United States, China and the European Union, which between them account for roughly half of all global output – are slowing at the same time. That’s unusual and troubling. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, says a third of the world economy will be in recession in 2023, and even for countries that manage to keep growing it will feel like a recession. The IMF has got it wrong – sometimes seriously wrong – in the past but even so, Georgieva’s pessimism is warranted. Just about every indicator of looming recession is flashing red. Prices are rising faster than wages, reducing consumer spending power. Corporate profitability is being squeezed by rising costs and weakening demand. Developing countries that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are now finding their debt burdens unmanageable. The two big asset bubbles of the post-pandemic era – crypto-currencies and tech stocks – both collapsed in 2022. Central banks are raising interest rates, exposing the vulnerability of “zombie” companies that have survived only thanks to a prolonged period of low interest rates. It is a lot cheaper in the US to borrow money for 10 years than it is to borrow money for one year. In the past this unusual phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale sign of a recession in the offing. China hauled the global economy out of its last serious downturn but is in no shape to do so this time. House prices have been rising at double-digit rates for the past three decades but are now falling in many cities because the boom has led to more and more homes being built. Politically, President Xi Jinping cannot afford a house price crash so he can bring demand and supply back into balance only by curbing property construction. That, coupled with the increase in coronavirus cases since the end of the zero tolerance approach to Covid-19, means China is the country to watch in 2023. The IMF says that for the first time since the early 1990s, China will grow less quickly than the global economy as a whole. It could be worse than the IMF envisages. So, the big question is not whether the global economy is in for a rough year in the 12 months ahead, because that is clearly the case. There may be one or two countries that buck the trend, but the UK is not going to be one of them. Another year of underperformance will keep the debate about Brexit alive, even though adjustment to life outside the EU is not the only – let alone the principal reason – for the UK’s current predicament. This is a global rather than a UK-specific problem, and it predates Brexit. Nor is the question why the bounce-back from the Covid-19 pandemic has been cut short, because that too is obvious. The post-lockdown recovery was built on the shakiest of foundations. Shortages led to a burst of inflation, amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks in the west found themselves powerless to combat a cost of living crisis other than by jacking up interest rates. The recessions or near recessions that will be seen in the US, the EU and the UK this year are no accident. They are a deliberate act of policy, which central bankers justify by saying it is a choice between pain now or more pain later. No, the real issue is whether the roaring 20s have been delayed or will never arrive. Put another way: is the global economy facing a temporary, if nasty, period of stagflation (a combination of weak growth and high inflation) or something deeper: a crisis of capitalism? And if it is the latter, what can be done about it? History may well repeat itself. The 1920s began with a pandemic, an inflationary boom and a deep recession. It took a while for better times to arrive, and when they did the driving force was a wave of new inventions, first developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but which took time to reveal their full potential. Techno-optimists say artificial intelligence and biotechnology will be to the 2020s what radio and the motorcar were to the 1920s: the catalyst for a period of markedly faster growth. They believe a period of abnormally lower interest rates has held back a fourth industrial revolution by allowing no-hoper companies to stagger on. A period of creative destruction will see this misallocation of capital end, leading to higher investment in the industries of the future. But the global economy has now been in the doldrums for 15 years. Money has been cheap and plentiful ever since the banks nearly went bust during the global financial crisis. There is not much evidence to suggest that the fourth industrial revolution is being held back by a shortage of capital. Rather, there has been a reluctance by both governments and the private sector to invest. Governments could have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs to rebuild clapped-out infrastructure, but failed to do so. The private sector preferred to use profits to buy back shares rather than taking a punt on new products. Financial engineering proved lucrative for elites, who assumed – quite wrongly – that because the system was working for them it was working for everybody. In one respect, the roaring 20s have already returned. While living standards are being squeezed for the many, for the super-rich it is a new gilded age. Three factors were behind the massive jump in productivity in the middle decades of the 20th century: ideas, investment and the struggle against inequality. Economies only really started to motor when new products were available to the masses through policies that encouraged full employment, collective bargaining and rising wages. Currently, there are plenty of ideas but the other two factors are missing. Until that changes, the global economy will be stuck in its low-growth rut.

It is estimated just 10% of services will be running on one of the worst days of action for decades. Around 12,500 train drivers from 15 firms will take part in the mass walkout. It comes as over the last week we have seen strike action from 40,000 workers on Network Rail and 14 train operating companies who have continued to strike. RMT members were on strike for 48 hours causing travel chaos for people across the UK. But today it is the turn of Aslef – which represents 96% of the train drivers in England, Scotland and Wales – who will continue into their second day of strikes in two days. Rail workers on the picket line at Grand Central Station in Birmingham yesterday (Picture: PA) MORE : What strikes are planned around New Year 2023? Trains, London buses, road workers and more The strike will bring services on affected lines to a halt and comes as more and more people in many different sectors of the economy are withdrawing their labour as employers refuse to help their employees during the cost-of-living crisis. But it’s not the end, as those from The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers are also set to walk out tomorrow and on Friday. It includes train drivers at 15 rail operators and is likely to shut down much of the country’s rail network. On all five days of action, trains will start later and finish much earlier than usual, running between 7.30am and 6.30pm, National Rail has warned. Tickets for 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 January can instead be used the day before the date on the ticket, or up to and including Tuesday 10 January. Timeline of strikes over the next few weeks – January 5 Train workers at 15 operators with the Aslef union to stage a 24-hour walkout.

Train drivers are joined today by London bus workers at Abellio, who are striking for eight days in total this month. Abellio buses have been affected on strike days – with other buses running but busier than usual. The action started back on December 8, but the bus strike dates around New Year included today and yesterday. Dozens of buses in London are going to be impacted by strikes. Rural Payments Agency (RPA) staff will also resume their strikes. Driving tests have likewise been disrupted today – with DVSA driving examiners’ strike starting in London, the South East, South Wales and the South West. ‘We don’t want to go on strike but the companies have pushed us into this place,’ said Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He added: ‘They have not offered our members at these companies a penny – and these are people who have not had an increase since April 2019. ‘That means they expect train drivers at these companies to take a real-terms pay cut – to work just as hard for considerably less – when inflation is running at north of 14%.’ Mick said: ‘The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us. ‘We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing. And that is unacceptable.’ Yesterday TUC (Trades Union Congress) leader Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of ‘underfunding and understaffing’. He wrote: ‘We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. ‘Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. ‘This is simply unsustainable. ‘But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. ‘That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.’ The mass strike action could cause chaos for commuters (Picture: Getty) Driving examiners and supporters picket outside a Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency office in a strike yesterday (Picture: Getty) MORE : Why aren’t the police allowed to go on strike and is any other profession banned? MORE : Brits heading back to work face worst rail strikes yet with five days of action Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: ‘That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. ‘Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. ‘But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. ‘In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. ‘This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. ‘We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love. ‘And so our public services can start to improve for everyone who relies on them.’ RMT general secretary Mick Lynch warned on Tuesday that industrial action will need to continue beyond May unless a reasonable offer to resolve the row over pay, jobs and conditions is made to the union.

The latest statistics on Scotland’s energy production (not oil and gas reserves) showed that over the first nine months of 2022, generation was up 34.7% compared to the same period in 2021 Final figures for 2021 show that the equivalent of 85.2% of all electricity used in Scotland (total generation minus net exports) came from renewable sources. Due to slightly better weather in 2021 this was actually a slight decrease, but has bounced back up again with the 2022 figures. The energy that is generated in Scotland is exported into the UK National Grid. Consumers in Scotland then buy it back. The further north you go in Scotland the tariff paid for buying it back, increases. So although places like Orkney and the massive windfarms in the north of mainland Scotland are producing well over their own needs in renewables, they are also paying the highest prices to buy back their own locally produced power. Scotland produces most of its renewable energy through wind but hydro is also very important. The future with wave and tidal power makes Scotland’s future as a producer of clean energy very bright. Oil and Gas in the UK Scotland still produces large amounts of fossil fuels through its existing extensive oil and gas fields. The income generated from these sources goes into the UK Exchequer. The UK Government is also very keen to open up more oil and gas fields. Figures from the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) The oil and gas industry plays a central role in the economy of the United Kingdom. Oil and gas account for more than three-quarters of the UK’s total primary energy needs. Oil provides 97 per cent of the fuel for transport, and gas is a key fuel for heating and electricity generation. Transport, heating and electricity each account for about one-third of the UK’s primary energy needs. Oil and gas are also major feedstocks for the petrochemicals industries producing pharmaceuticals, plastics, cosmetics and domestic appliances. Wikipedia Click on this link for more information on UK Oil and Gas: North Sea Transition Authority Scotland’s Renewable Production Energy is mostly a reserved power to the UK Government. The Scottish Government has planning power over the development of wind farms as we have seen recently in Orkney (OIC Faray Windfarm Approved by Scottish Government Despite Reporter’s Recommendation to Refuse ) and licences to develop offshore wind. (Islanders Attend Consultation Events for the West of Orkney Windfarm) There is a major expansion of the wind generation sector in Scotland. In the last twelve months, renewable electricity capacity has risen, up 11.7% from September 2021 to 13.6 GW in September 2022. As of September 2022, 397 renewable electricity projects with a capacity of 17.1 GW are being progressed. 3.4 GW of these are under construction, most of which are offshore wind farms off the Moray Firth. 6.8 GW are awaiting construction and 6.9 GW in planning. The generation and use of energy is a complex picture in Scotland. As part of the UK and with a devolved system of government, control over energy is mostly reserved to the London Government. Oil and Gas is a major sector. The UK Government intends to expand both this and Nuclear production. As well as producing energy we also need to use less but as the weather in 2022 was better for renewable generation it also made our homes and businesses harder to heat. Fuel poverty should not exist in a country which generates so much energy – but it does because we do not control the price or have the means to do so. Scottish Government funded schemes to make our homes and businesses more energy efficient are extremely important (more about that here, Home Energy Scotland). But Scotland still relies very much on fossil fuels.

There is a cost to our landscape and seascape. But, in a climate emergency why is the UK Government developing non-renewable energy sources? And where is the hope for Scots struggling to pay their energy bills when they pay the highest rates in the UK to buy back that same power they see being generated where they live?

The Department for Transport (DfT) rejects the accusation, saying ministers have held “polite, constructive meetings” with union bosses. Train drivers employed by 15 rail firms have walked out for 24 hours in a dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions. It is the sixth Aslef drivers’ strike since summer 2022, and is bracketed by 48-hour stoppages by the main rail union, the RMT. Many operators will run no trains on Thursday. Ahead of the walk-out, Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, blamed ministers for triggering the strike. He told The Independent: “We currently have government that seems to want to destroy the railway and put it into managed decline, alienate the workforce, drive passengers off it by increasing fares on a regular basis and causing the problems that are currently there. “We find ourselves in a cycle of – I can only say – corruption, really. The government destroying the railway. The government’s caused this, the government can solve it.” The Department for Transport (DfT) rejected the comments, saying that the transport secretary Mark Harper and rail minister Huw Merriman had been talking to union leaders about their desire for a thriving railway. A spokesperson for the DfT said: “The transport secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long-term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation, and costing every household an extra £1,000.” When Mr Harper entered office 10 weeks ago, he said his top priority was to end the long and bitter tangle of rail disputes between Network Rail, the train operators and the unions. Another two-day RMT strike begins at midnight, causing the cancellation of four out of five trains across Great Britain and disrupting services until Sunday.

The events were created by Developing the Young Workforce (DYW) Inverness & Central Highland, in collaboration with the UHI Inverness college and Skills Development Scotland. They gave S2-S4 Inverness school pupils the opportunity to engage directly with NHS Highland workers and other employers, in a bid to help them make better informed decisions about their future careers. NHS Highland hosted stalls centred around a range of different professions under the health and care umbrella including healthcare science, medical, nursing, dental, midwifery, pharmacy, and adult social care. At each stall teams carried out different interactive “hands-on” activities with young people to provide some experience and educate them about the different services and job roles. Activities showcased included basic life support, clinical skills demonstrations, birthing activities, mental health awareness and dementia awareness with insights into the challenges posed for older adults, and much more.

Danske Bank has revised its previous forecast of a 0.5% annual fall in economic activity in 2023 downwards and now expects output to contract by about 1% next year. It believes the retail sector will be worst affected by recession, shrinking by 4.5% in 2023, more than twice a predicted contraction rate of 2.2% for this year. Conor Lambe, Danske Bank chief economist, said: “The UK economy contracted in the third quarter of 2022 and we think that economic activity in Northern Ireland is also likely to have declined. Output is then projected to fall further in the final quarter of the year and through most of next year, with both economies experiencing a period of recession as a number of factors adversely impact activity levels. “Inflation is expected to decline gradually during 2023 but remain elevated and weigh down on household purchasing power. Consumer confidence is also particularly low and monetary policy is tightening. “Looking forward, and while noting the considerable uncertainty around the outlook, we expect annual output in Northern Ireland to decline by around 1% next year.” But the bank has forecast that the economy will have grown by around 4% by the end of this year, reflecting a relative improvement on the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses and consumers have been hit by rising costs throughout 2022, with inflation prompting the Bank of England to increase interest rates to 3%. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK economy shrank by 0.3% over the three months to October, although there was a rebound in October itself. As well as retail, other consumer-facing sectors such as accommodation and food, along with arts, entertainment and recreation, are also predicted to take heavy hits during 2023. Danske Bank forecast declines of nearly 4% for both sectors. And output for manufacturing companies is also expected to shrink next year, with a 1.1% fall in output, while the construction sector is tipped for a similar rate of contraction. However, slight growth is predicted for the world of information and communication, as well as scientific and technical services.

It also costs those striking at a time when family budgets are tight.“As well as protecting the freedom to strike, the Government must also protect life and livelihoods. While we hope that voluntary agreements can continue to be made in most cases, introducing minimum safety levels – the minimum levels of service we expect to be provided – will restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption.” The Government said it will invite unions to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about what is fair and affordable in public sector pay settlements for 2023/24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged industrial action.A statement said: “Ministers are reaching out to unions to invite them to sit down and discuss the evidence that the Government will be submitting to the pay review bodies – and hopes that unions will also share their evidence.“If the offer is accepted, discussions will take place between government departments and unions in the coming weeks on issues including pay evidence, workload and conditions in the public sector.“These discussions will help ensure the evidence submitted to the pay review bodies is as considered and informed as possible, including reflecting areas of common ground.“The Government is clear that the well-established independent pay review process is the right way to set public sector pay – it provides independent, expert advice and is a neutral process in which all parties play a role. “These new discussions would feed into this process and are offered as the Government recognises the particular economic challenges the country faces this year.”The Government called on the unions to cancel upcoming strikes in a bid to resolve the disputes “constructively through dialogue”.“However, the Government also has a duty to the public to ensure their safety, protect their access to vital public services, and help them go about their daily lives,” the statement said.“The Government will always protect the ability to strike, but it must be balanced with the public’s right to life and livelihoods.“That’s why the Government will introduce new laws to ensure a basic level of service in some of our most crucial sectors when industrial action takes place.”Gary Smith, GMB general secretary, said: “A Government that has presided over 13 years of failure in our public services is now seeking to scapegoat the NHS staff and ambulance workers who do so much to care for the people of our country.“The NHS can only function with the goodwill of its incredible staff and attacking their fundamental right to take action will alienate them even further and do nothing to help patients and the public.“We are always ready to discuss our members’ pay but the Government is refusing to talk about problems as they exist now, instead they want to kick the can down the road.“There are huge questions over the NHS Pay Review Body, as ministers’ actions have consistently undermined its independence.

Children in years 1, 2 and 3, between the ages of five and eight, will be given age-appropriate lessons designed to introduce them to different careers, training and skills, and inspire them about the world of work. The £2.6m initiative will be introduced across 55 education investment areas, or “cold spots”, where school outcomes are the weakest, targeting 600,000 pupils in more than 2,200 primary schools. Pupils will get the chance to meet employers and “role models” from a range of industries, to try to raise aspirations and link learning to future jobs and careers they may pursue. They will be introduced to careers in the green economy, technology, engineering, construction, Stem, creative industries, aerospace, hospitality and healthcare. The Department for Education (DfE) said evidence had shown that children started to form ideas about their future when they began primary school, yet most careers guidance took place in secondary schools. In addition to the primary careers programme, the DfE also gave details of a new requirement for secondary school pupils to be given greater exposure to providers of technical education, so they know about alternatives to a traditional academic route. Under legislation that came into force at the start of the year, schools will be required to give all pupils in years 8 to 13 at least six opportunities to meet a range of providers of technical education, including apprenticeships, T-levels and higher technical qualifications. Robert Halfon, the minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said good careers advice was vital to open up opportunities for young people from all backgrounds and create the future workforce the UK needed. “The changes we are making to boost our careers programme will raise ambitions from an early age for thousands of children in primary schools across the country, while providing opportunities to unlock talent, think about skills, engage with employers and discover different workplaces.” Oli de Botton, a former headteacher who is chief executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company, which will coordinate the primary careers programme, said: “Our new primary programme will bring careers inspiration to children early in their school life by connecting them with role models and showing them how different subjects relate to jobs.” The education charity Teach First will help train primary school teachers in disadvantaged areas where the scheme will be introduced. Dominic Wyse, a professor of early childhood and primary education at University College London’s Institute of Education, said the initiative’s success would depend on how well it was delivered. “It does worry me it could be terribly dull. There’s a real question – will it motivate children, will it motivate teachers, and is it the sort of push that’s needed right now?” Sarah Hannafin, a senior policy adviser for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), whose members mainly work in the primary sector, said it was right that careers education should not be left to secondary schools. However, she added: “All schools must be provided with the resources they need to provide high-quality careers education, but current provision remains underfunded. Schools will find it challenging to meet increasing requirements and expectations with no additional resources to deliver them.”",Children as young as five in England target of new careers programme,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/05/children-young-five-england-urged-think-about-careers

A statement said: “Ministers are reaching out to unions to invite them to sit down and discuss the evidence that the Government will be submitting to the pay review bodies – and hopes that unions will also share their evidence. “If the offer is accepted, discussions will take place between government departments and unions in the coming weeks on issues including pay evidence, workload and conditions in the public sector. “These discussions will help ensure the evidence submitted to the pay review bodies is as considered and informed as possible, including reflecting areas of common ground. “The Government is clear that the well-established independent pay review process is the right way to set public sector pay – it provides independent, expert advice and is a neutral process in which all parties play a role. “These new discussions would feed into this process and are offered as the Government recognises the particular economic challenges the country faces this year.” The Government called on the unions to cancel upcoming strikes in a bid to resolve the disputes “constructively through dialogue”. “However, the Government also has a duty to the public to ensure their safety, protect their access to vital public services, and help them go about their daily lives,” the statement said. “The Government will always protect the ability to strike, but it must be balanced with the public’s right to life and livelihoods. “That’s why the Government will introduce new laws to ensure a basic level of service in some of our most crucial sectors when industrial action takes place.” Gary Smith, GMB general secretary, said: “A Government that has presided over 13 years of failure in our public services is now seeking to scapegoat the NHS staff and ambulance workers who do so much to care for the people of our country. “The NHS can only function with the goodwill of its incredible staff and attacking their fundamental right to take action will alienate them even further and do nothing to help patients and the public. “We are always ready to discuss our members’ pay but the Government is refusing to talk about problems as they exist now, instead they want to kick the can down the road. “There are huge questions over the NHS Pay Review Body, as ministers’ actions have consistently undermined its independence. The process needs real reform and our members need a much stronger commitment than we heard today.” The announcement said unions would be bound to follow the legislation and would risk employers bringing an injunction to prevent strikes from taking place or seeking damages if they did not comply. RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: “Curtailing workers’ freedom to participate in lawful industrial action is always undemocratic and we will look closely at what the Government releases. “We will meet with ministers to see their evidence for the pay process. However, only negotiations on our dispute can avert the planned action this month and I urge the Prime Minister to show a renewed sense of urgency, grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses without further delay. “As for minimum staffing, last month’s action was safe for patients because of detailed discussions we chose to initiate with the NHS to protect emergency services and life-saving care. The public respected that and even ministers acknowledged our constructive approach. “Safe staffing levels that are set in law are what we want to see year-round not just in these extreme circumstances. “We’ve long campaigned for governments to be accountable for safe and effective staffing levels in NHS and social care to prevent one nurse being left with 15, 20 or even 25 sick patients. “The evidence is unequivocal – safe staffing saves lives and having the right number of registered nurses on duty has a direct impact on the safety and quality of patient care. Today’s highly unsafe situation is what is driving our members to say ‘enough is enough’.” Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect said: “This hollow invitation ignores the fact that a majority of public sector workers are not covered by a pay review body, including nearly all civil servants. We have been calling for years for this to be rectified, something which the Government has consistently ignored. “These workers have been some of the most harshly treated over the past decade of real-terms pay cuts, and now the Government is signalling its intent to leave them out once again. “Our members have already indicated their willingness to take industrial action and there is nothing in this announcement that will persuade us not to proceed to a formal ballot as planned.” Unison’s assistant general secretary Jon Richards said: “Ministers should focus their time and energy on rebuilding trust and relationships with workers, not silencing and suppressing them. “Minimum staffing levels in the NHS would be welcome by the public and health staff every single day of the week. That could avoid people being left lying in agony on A&E floors or dying in the backs of ambulances. “The NHS is on its knees because of record vacancies. The idea of limiting legal staffing levels to strike days and threatening to sack or fine health workers at such a time shows proper patient care isn’t ministers’ priority. “The Government is picking ill-advised fights with NHS employees and unions to mask years of dismal failure to tackle pay and staffing.” TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “This is an attack on the right to strike. It’s an attack on working people, and it’s an attack on one of our longstanding British liberties. “It means that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don’t. That’s wrong, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal. “The announcement offers nothing more to help with this year’s pay and the cost-of-living crisis. “The only offer of talks is for next year. But we need to resolve the current disputes and boost the pay of public sector workers now. “The Prime Minister said yesterday his door is always open – if he’s serious, he should prove it. He should take up my offer to get around the table to improve this year’s pay and end the current disputes. “There is a world of difference between promises of jam tomorrow with technical discussions about pay review bodies, and proper negotiations on pay in the here and now. “Our public services are already deep in a staffing crisis. But this Government has gone from clapping key workers to threating them with the sack if they take lawful action for a pay rise. It will only push more people away from essential jobs in public services, harming the whole nation.” Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said: “Just when you thought the Government could go no lower, ministers say they’re looking to deal with strikes by making them illegal, rather than negotiate with unions. “PCS members are on strike because they cannot afford the cost of living. We view any attempt to outlaw strikes as an attack on the trade union movement and we will resist that at every stage.” Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said: “This is an empty offer from the Tory government, and a meaningless stunt from Grant Shapps. “Firefighters and other key workers are facing a ‘real-terms’ pay cut, against a backdrop of rising food and fuel prices during the cost-of-living crisis. “Nothing in this statement from Grant Shapps seeks to address the ‘in work’ poverty faced by these workers who kept our public services going during the pandemic. “They were the Covid heroes. “This grandstanding from Grant Shapps is badly misjudging the public mood. “The Government should call off all pay cuts and we’ll call off strikes. “Grant Shapps should stop telling workers to accept falling real wages.” Claire Sullivan, director of employer relations and union services at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Imposing new anti-strike legislation in a country which already has some of the most onerous strike laws in Europe is unnecessary, weak and unworkable. “The Government is well aware that the proposed ‘voluntary agreements’ in the NHS are already in place due to health workers’ commitment to providing ‘critical to life’ cover. “The way for the Government to avoid current and future workplace disputes is through ongoing, meaningful dialogue and by working in partnership with trade unions. The CSP and other health unions have been warning of the developing NHS crisis for a decade and calling for urgent pay talks for several months, only to be met repeatedly by a complete block from Government.”",Government pressing ahead with ‘minimum safety levels’ legislation,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/unions-government-grant-shapps-nhs-prime-minister-b2256705.html

The official government forecasts from HM Treasury show a fall in UK economic output (gross domestic product, GDP) of 0.8 per cent in 2023. The Scottish Fiscal Commission are predicting a 1.2 per cent fall in Scottish economic output. There are no official forecasts for the Highland economy but it is very likely that the GDP performance will be even worse, with probably a fall of about 1.5 per cent. The reasons for that include the greater importance of the tourism industry. Inflation in 2023 is forecast to be about five per cent. That implies an annual fall in personal incomes of about 6.5 per cent in the Highlands. That means another substantial reduction in personal spending, which will have serious negative implications for local shops and other businesses. Looking further ahead, 2024 will almost certainly be better but there can be little doubt that 2023 will be another bad year for the local economy. The world economy had a very bad 2022 because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and an inflation rate exceeding 10 per cent. The huge increase in oil and gas prices has badly affected the output of many industries and also consumer spending. There is little expectation of an improvement until later in 2023, as the above forecasts show. The Highlands have a diversified economy, dominated by the service sector, including tourism in normal years. The manufacturing sector is relatively small but includes important industries such as offshore oil and gas production, renewable energy, Scotch whisky and fish processing. Public sector employment has held up well, because of the importance of bodies such as the Highland Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, NatureScot and the Crofting Commission. However, all their budgets have been under severe pressure and that will continue during 2023. Tourism is very important for many parts of the Highlands. It had a very bad 2022 and unfortunately there are few signs of a significant improvement in 2023. There were big falls in visitor numbers last year because of the various Covid restrictions, which resulted in similar falls in revenue for local hotels, B&Bs and many local shops. Hopefully there will be a revival during 2023. Some industries have done surprisingly well, such as Scotch whisky. New distilleries and expansions are currently under construction in various parts of the Highlands. It is a very strange time for the energy industry in the Highlands, including offshore oil and gas, wind farms and other renewables. Oil and gas production is declining steadily but the recent huge increases in world oil and gas prices have helped existing fields and will possibly lead to a few new developments, despite environmental opposition. In contrast, there has been disappointing progress with renewable energy developments and there are few reasons to expect 2023 to be better. A few local businesses, notably Global Energy at Nigg, are doing very well from wind farm contracts but the overall growth has been much less than predicted. The fishing industry should have a better year because of recent international agreements on fish catches. It and the local fish farms have also benefitted from the rises in consumer prices. Most other local businesses have been badly affected by the huge rises in energy prices. However, world oil and gas prices have fallen significantly in recent weeks. Consumer confidence is low and I expect that to continue during the first half of 2023 at least. The lower consumer spending will have negative impacts for shops and other service sector businesses. More closures seem inevitable. There can be little doubt that the first half of 2023 will be another bad time for the Highland economy. I hope there will be a big improvement during the second half of the year but the current indications are not promising. Tony Mackay is an Inverness-based economist.

Morris Leslie, the company behind the West Kinfauns plans, won planning permission in principle in August. 2022? The proposal is for a four-star, four-storey hotel as well as holiday lodges, transport museum and shops. Cafes, restaurants, bakeries and a cycle repair shops could also form part of the development, which could create up to 130 full-time jobs. Next steps in Perthshire leisure hub Morris Leslie’s group operations director Graham Ogilvie has revealed the next steps for the development. Reflecting on a year of progress, he said: “2022 has all been about getting the consent. 2023 is working through the consent and splitting the development into different parts. “The lodges will be the first part of the development. We will progress with the applying for detailed consent and then construction will commence. “This is something we will do ourselves. In the past 18 months we have created our first holiday park at Alyth. This would also be done under the Morris Leslie Villages banner. “It will be around 50 lodges on site. This part of the project alone would be an investment of around £10 million.” Hotel operator sought Morris Leslie is best known for hiring construction equipment, but also has auction and property interests. It also has its headquarters on the site it acquired from Edrington in 2019. However, the company is not going to be a hotel operator. Armed with the outline planning permission from Perth and Kinross Council it will be marketing the hotel opportunity. “There have been discussions with operators that are ongoing,” Mr Ogilvie said. “Getting the brand is the easier bit, it’s the funding and development of the construction project where there are negotiations and discussions ongoing. “I’d like to think we’ll have an operator on board in 12 months’ time.” He warns that the quoted £33.8 million cost is likely to be far higher due to inflation. “The build costs from when we started the project to where we are now have moved significantly but room rates for hotels have moved higher as well,” he said. The park and ride facility, museum and retail elements of the project are likely to come at the later stages of the development. Neighbouring the site is a new 15-home development by Ogilvie Homes who won permission on appeal to the Scottish Government. Morris Leslie hopes around 80,000 people a year could be attracted to the site, boosting the local economy by £4m.

Comment No one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are The dysfunctional rail system can only be fixed if rail pensions are also sorted out John Ralfe 6 January 2023 • 9:35am 350,000 people are part of the Railways Pension Scheme Credit: Jacob King/PA Wire New Year, new rail strikes, new chaos for rail passengers. Although unions have been locked in a bitter dispute with government and rail companies for months, over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions, we haven’t heard much about pensions. Perhaps this is because no one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are? Pensions for train operating company staff are still based on final salary, and most still have a retirement age of 60. Even public sector pensions are now based on career average salaries, with a higher retirement age. The average salary for a train driver with 10-20 years experience is reported to be £55,000, so a driver retiring at 60 with 30 years pension would get an average inflation-linked pension of £22,000, plus a £33,000 cash lump sum. Train company accounts show the annual cost of new pension promises is around 60pc of salary – a huge part of overall pay – even after employee contributions. Rail pensions have a unique “cost sharing” arrangement, with all regular and deficit cash contributions split 60/40 between employers and employees, which may explain the reluctance to increase annual cash contributions. Each train operating company is part of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), set up at privatisation in 1994. It is an industry-wide scheme with over 100 legally separate sections, including Network Rail, and freight, engineering and maintenance companies. At privatisation, all pensioners and deferred members were transferred to a new section with a “crown guarantee” underwritten by taxpayers. RPS is one of the UK’s largest pension schemes, with £37bn of assets at December 2021, and 350,000 members, including 100,000 current employees. Each RPS section has a three-year valuation but the December 2016 valuation for train operating companies have still not been agreed with the Pensions Regulator, way, way beyond the legal deadline. Although the established rail franchising rules mean train operating companies must pay cash contributions over the life of a franchise, they have no liability for a deficit when the franchise ends. The deficit is simply passed on to the next company taking over the franchise, in a game of pass-the-parcel. If no one is prepared to take on the franchise, it reverts to the Government. The latest accounts for each of the train operating companies show the combined pension deficit is around £8bn. We know the effective re-nationalisation of the train operators in 2020 means all the industry’s annual losses are paid by taxpayers. But re-nationalisation also means taxpayers are on the hook for the pension deficit, which has been hidden from taxpayers. The dysfunctional rail system can only be sorted out if rail pensions are also sorted out. Despite the threat of further strikes, this means closing the expensive and risky defined benefit pension and moving to defined contribution. The good news for rail staff is that some of the cost savings can be used to increase monthly pay. Defined contributions would still leave the £8bn deficit to be paid, partly through higher fares, but with taxpayers left picking up most of the bill.

The British Medical Association (BMA) warned of three days of further disruption for the NHS if health secretary Steve Barclay continues to refuse to negotiate over pay demands. It comes ahead of a ballot opening on 9 January, when 45,000 junior doctors in England will be asked whether they want to strike in the row over pay. The BMA claimed that Mr Barclay was making attempts to find a negotiated settlement impossible by ignoring “all calls and letters” despite the prospect of strike action. “Pay erosion, exhaustion and despair are forcing junior doctors out of the NHS, pushing waiting lists even higher as patients suffer needlessly,” said Dr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Robert Laurenson, co-chairs of the BMA junior doctors committee. They added: “The government’s refusal to address fifteen years of pay erosion has given junior doctors no choice but to ballot for industrial action. If the government won’t fight for our health service, then we will.” The union said successive governments have overseen 15 years of real-term pay cuts for junior doctors, saying it amounted to a “staggering and unjustifiable” 26.1 per cent decline in pay since 2008-09. But the government has awarded only a 2 per cent pay rise for junior doctors, and Mr Barclay has continued to point to the recommendation of the independent pay review body as a reason to avoid negotiations. The BMA said it was “particularly galling” to see Rishi Sunak and his ministers refer to the pay review body. “The reality is that the doctors’ pay review body has been constrained by political interference for more than a decade,” said the union’s co-chairs. The prospect of fresh NHS disruption comes as ambulance staff prepare to walk out on 11 and 23 January, while nurses will strike again for two consecutive days on 18 and 19 January. The government has vowed to press ahead with plans to introduce new legislation to enforce “minimum safety levels” in the NHS and five other key sectors during industrial action. Health unions reacted with fury to the move, saying it would do nothing to resolve the disputes breaking out across the country. The Royal College of Nursing, GMB and Unison – leading the walks-outs planned for nurses and ambulance staff later in January – also vowed to opposed “desperate” anti-strike legislation. The government also urged union leaders to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about public sector pay settlements for 2023-24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged strikes. But unions bosses said ministers must engage on pay demands for the current year, with the GMB health union accusing the government of trying to “kick the can down the road”. The BMA and other health bodies have warned of an “exodus” of NHS staff as industrial dispute rumbles on. Four in ten (40 per cent) of junior doctors plan to leave the health service as soon as they can find another role, a survey carried out by the BMA last month found. Low pay and poor working conditions were the main reasons cited for wanting to leave, with the union warning that the NHS “would not be able to cope” without two-fifths of its junior doctor workforce. It comes after Mr Barclay appeared to blame high numbers of flu, Covid and Strep A cases for the particular pressures the NHS faced over Christmas – a claim refuted by health leaders who pointed to long-term struggles. Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA’s consultants committee, said the government’s refusal to admit that the NHS is in a state crisis was “simply delusional”.",Junior doctors to vote on plans to hold three-day strike in row over pay,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/junior-doctors-strike-nhs-march-b2256855.html

The latest S&P Global/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI), closely watched by the housebuilding sector, scored 48.8 in December, down from 50.4 in November. Any score below 50 indicates that construction sector output has shrunk, and December’s score marks the first contraction since August. It also came in broadly in line with the consensus, with analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics predicting PMI would fall to around 48.5. The sector has suffered the knock-on effects of a slowing housing market, with mortgages becoming more expensive for home buyers resulting in fewer house sales, economists said. Yet construction firms continue to face higher inflation, pushing up the cost of raw materials and transportation, and the looming threat of a recession. As a result, builders are feeling downbeat about the future of their businesses, the survey revealed. December saw confidence among businesses in the outlook for the year drop into negative territory for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and for only the sixth time on record. Dr John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: “The construction sector was stuck in the mud in December with the steepest fall in activity since the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020 and a similarly fast drop in pipelines of new work. “Housebuilding saw a notable change of direction, with a mix of higher inflation for raw materials and transportation and the squeeze on affordability rates for mortgages resulting in fewer house sales.” The commercial sector marked a “bright spot” in the survey, with activity growing fractionally, with a score of 50.3. But it was offset by contractions across the residential and civil engineering sectors in December. Dr Glen added: “Civil engineering, responsible for larger projects, continued to be the weakest performer again, with a sixth month in the doldrums as uncertainty about the UK economy reared its ugly head again and customers hesitated.” Furthermore, the survey suggests that builders are reining back on recruitment amid a hesitancy to spend too much when the future of the economy is uncertain. Employment fell below a score of 50 for the first time since January 2021, with weak sales meaning that vacancies are often not being filled, the survey indicated. Dr Glen said: “Builders are fast running out of the resilient spirit maintained over the last couple of years as the blocks to success piled up and the winter of discontent with high inflation, strikes and shortages continues.” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The construction sector managed to keep its head above water through the autumn, but now is being dragged down by the recession in the wider economy and the surge in borrowing costs faced by households and businesses.” But he pointed out that a drop in activity in December may have been partially driven by some builders “downing tools” during the week of heavy snow across parts of the UK.",Builders deflated as construction sector shrinks,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/builders-deflated-as-construction-sector-shrinks-b2257249.html

Speaking on a visit to a school in Battersea, south-west London, the Prime Minister said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday.” Pressed whether the talks would include discussions on this year’s pay, the Prime Minister did not rule this out, saying: “What we have said is we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation with all union leaders about what is responsible, what is reasonable, and what is affordable for our country when it comes to pay. “I’m hopeful that those talks can be constructive and we can find a way through this.” Asked whether he could meet the nursing union’s demands “halfway” after it suggested a pay rise of ten per cent rather than nearly double, the PM added: “We have always been clear that we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation, a two way conversation with union leaders.” The Standard understands that the move is a new approach by the Government, with Cabinet ministers, not the PM, meeting the unions that their departments work with, and that the Government aims to talk about pay deals for 2023/24 rather than this year. However, the stand-off between the Government and unions has escalated after ministers proposed bringing in legislation to force some sectors such as health and transport to continue delivering a “minimum service” during industrial action. Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation. Asked a second time whether people could be sacked for not going to work under the new law, the premier said: ""I fully believe in the unions' role in our society and the freedom for them to strike. ""I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption. ""That's why we're going to bring forward new laws, in common with countries like France, Italy, Spain and others, that ensure that we have minimum levels of safety in critical areas like fire, like ambulance, so that even when strikes are going on you know that your health will be protected. ""I think that's entirely reasonable and that's what our new laws will do."" Labour has said it would repeal the “minimum service” laws, if they are passed before the General Election, and if it wins the poll expected next year. Britain is being hit by a wave of strikes including by rail workers, nurses, paramedics, postal workers, border staff and civil servants.","Rishi Sunak invites all union leaders for ‘grown-up, honest’ talks on Monday in bid to end strikes",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/strikes-rishi-sunak-unions-talks-rail-nurses-b1051247.html

The Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure vital public services maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike. Minimum safety levels will be set for fire, ambulance and rail services and the Government said it will consult on the “adequate level of coverage”. Speaking from the picket line at Euston station on Friday, Mr Lynch told BBC Breakfast that the Government is trying to “close down” the unions with the new legislation. “What this is a symbol of is that the Government are losing the argument,” he said. “They’ve lost the argument on austerity and pay, and the state of our national public services. “And instead they want to close that argument down by closing down the unions and stopping us from campaigning against poverty.” He said the Bill is a threat to sack union members if they refuse to go to work. “What they are saying is that they will sack our members if they don’t go to work,” he said. “They are going to conscript our members. “We have to name who will go to work, and if those members in a lawful manner don’t want to cross our picket line they can be dismissed individually and the union can be fined. “So we will have to see what the law says.” It comes as services have been crippled by the walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) at Network Rail and 14 train operators on Friday. The action will last for 48 hours and follows a stoppage on Thursday by train drivers in the Aslef union which caused widespread disruption. Only around 20% of normal services are running on Friday and trains will finish earlier. The strike ends a week of industrial action on the railways, with the dispute remaining deadlocked. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a school in south-west London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had invited union leaders for what he hopes will be a “grown-up” conversation on Monday about what is affordable. The Prime Minister was asked if proposed legislation could see nurses sacked for striking, and if it was his ambition to go further and make some more strikes in critical services illegal. Mr Sunak said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday. “We incredibly value the important work that our public sector workers do, especially our nurses, and we want to have an honest, grown-up conversation about what’s affordable, what’s responsible for the country. “Those invitations have gone out and I’m hopeful that those meetings can happen on Monday so we can have a productive conversation and find a way through this.” Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation.

As many projects were pushed back last year, the beginning of 2023 will be marked by a steady pipeline of work. However, this optimism will be short-lived. Recessionary forces will strike and work is expected to tail off at the back end of 2023. No one feels confident. It is a nervous period to operate as a business, and the sector must stay alert. For the housing market, demand is falling amidst the cost of living crisis, job insecurity and the recession. Declining property prices should stabilise by Spring 2023 yet only those not bound to the difficulties of securing a mortgage or with sufficient savings will be able to afford the luxury of entering the property ladder. The government could help stimulate demand in the housing market by introducing a reduced stamp duty rate for first-time buyers and those wanting to downsize to a smaller property. Confidence in the market will return, but it will take time. Ultimately while the best-run construction companies will survive, partly due to their inherent financial strength, others, including good contractors who may be dependent on third parties, will unfortunately fail. The recession and cost of the living crisis will continue to bite hard. The sector must brace itself for a challenging and uncertain 2023.","UK building sector activity falls, as house prices drop again; eurozone inflation down – business live",https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jan/06/uk-house-prices-fall-us-jobs-eurozone-inflation-train-strikes-business-live

In all, occupiers from a wide range of business sectors have taken a combined total of 120,000 sq ft at Malton’s premier employment park. Sean Harrison, managing director of Harrison Developments said: “These new deals are a tremendous vindication of the substantial investment we have made in our park. “More than 350 new and sustainable jobs have been created on site, which makes us very proud. The wide variety of successful businesses here is also an indication of the strength of the economy in the Ryedale area. Bella di Notte (Image: Press release) “We are especially pleased that successful Yorkshire businesses such as Bella di Notte and Dales The Chef’s Choice have moved into larger premises on our park, because they like the location and the ambience so much. We have been delighted to accommodate their needs, as they have outgrown their current buildings. “These are not the easiest of times, as we emerge from a global pandemic into a worrying cost of living crisis, but the current level of activity at our park gives us confidence for the future,” said Mr Harrison. Luke Counter, owner of the multi-award-winning Counter Interiors, which now occupies a new 1,500 sq ft mezzanine showroom, said: “I can’t speak highly enough of the Malton Enterprise Park, which is the perfect base for us. The flexibility of the mezzanine unit which we occupy means that we now have an extensive showroom, storeroom and offices. “We are based in Clifton in York, but quite a few of our customers are from the Malton and Ryedale area, so it made sense for us to open another showroom here. The location, just by the A64, is ideal, with easy access to the rest of the county.

Just this week, Amazon said it was axing 18,000 workers, or 6% of its office staff, while business software firm Salesforce said it would reduce its workforce by 10%, or roughly 8,000 people. That followed announcements from dozens of other firms including big names such as Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, hardware heavyweight Cisco, and payments firm Stripe. Despite the belt-tightening seen in Silicon Valley, the world's largest economy soldiers on. Employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, according to the latest official figures. Although that was slower than gains seen in 2021, when activity roared back to life after the pandemic, it was still strong by most standards. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, returning to historic lows. The economy is widely predicted to slow in the coming months as rising prices weigh on consumer spending. Firms are also grappling with higher borrowing costs after the US central bank hiked rates rapidly last year. So are the cuts in the tech industry a warning sign for others? ""I don't think people should be worried,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. ""What we're seeing right now seems to be... a correction, not the start of an ominous, systematic recession."" Many tech executives making the announcements have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic, when more activity moved online and business boomed. Funding for smaller start-ups has also dried up due to higher interest rates and the sharp downturn in the US stock market in 2022. Big hits some firms have taken from the meltdown in the crypto sector have not helped the mood either. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM, said the wave of tech cuts represented a ""necessary and expected"" adjustment after a generation of rapid growth, fuelled in part by low interest rates, which culminated in the pandemic frenzy. ""An era of excess has come to an end,"" he said. ""Firms and individuals should be prepared to reset expectations about growth, employment and investment across what continues to be a very solid industry."" He suggested that tech firms will no longer be insulated from ups and downs in the wider economy, including the expected downturns in Europe and the UK this year. But he added that the job losses should not be ""over-interpreted"", noting that many of the workers affected, at least in the US, appear to be finding new jobs quickly. The latest jobs report from the Labor Department showed that payrolls in the information sector - which includes much of the tech industry - shrank by just 5,000 from November to December. That's despite thousands of job cuts being announced in recent months and compared to a year ago, employment is up. ""It's probably a canary in the coal mine for the global economy more than it is for the American economy,"" he added, noting that many of the tech cuts have hit foreign staff. Last week, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that a third of the world would likely be in recession in 2023. That will hurt tech firms, many of which do big business overseas. But for now, the US labour market has remained unexpectedly resilient, making some hopeful that the country will be able to fend off a harsh downturn, despite the central bank raising interest rates to try to cool the economy and price rises. Nearly every sector in the US economy added jobs last month, with bars and restaurants, health care firms and construction businesses helping to drive the gains. Although job losses are rising - especially in sectors vulnerable to higher interest rates like housing, banking and tech - the figures overall remained near historic lows last year, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has been tracking such announcements since the 1990s. ""We are seeing the labour market cooling,"" he says. ""It's a slowdown but I don't think I could say at this point whether or not it's a panic situation."" Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, said he worries many of the layoff announcements reflect peer pressure, as executives feel compelled to copy other firms making cuts - even as they continue to churn out healthy profits. If that sentiment spreads, as he expects, it risks turning the forecasts of economic hardship into reality. ""Companies do what other companies do,"" he said. ""This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because if everybody lays somebody off, the unemployment rate will go up and we will in fact have a worse economy.""",Are tech job cuts a warning for the wider economy?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64189106?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Rebecca Morelle,85546280,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F74F/production/_128211336_virgin-orbit-88.jpg,en,2023-01-07 04:12:22,-0.019,GB,"The first-ever orbital rocket launch from British soil is set to blast off on Monday, marking the start of the UK's race to space. The ambition is to turn the country into a global player in space - from manufacturing satellites, to building rockets and creating new spaceports. But can the UK carve out a place in an increasingly crowded market - and why try to reach for the stars? ""We are the guinea pigs,"" says Melissa Thorpe. ""It is the first time any of us have done this, so it's been quite a learning experience."" Melissa is in charge of Spaceport Cornwall, which is about to attempt its very first foray into space. She's showing me around their base at Newquay Airport. There's all the usual hubbub of activity: passengers arriving, suitcases being loaded, planes being fuelled. But there's also something more surprising on the tarmac: a 21m-long rocket. A team is busy prepping it for the first ever launch from UK soil that will take satellites into orbit around the Earth. But this is a blast off with a difference. There won't be a vertical launch from the ground. Instead, the rocket is fixed underneath the wing of a modified jumbo jet. Once the plane is mid-air, the rocket will be released and fire its engines to head into space. Setting up the UK's first spaceport has taken years and a lot of hard work, plus an entirely new regulatory framework to ensure these launches are safe. The hope is it will make a difference to the local area, one of the poorest in the UK, by bringing in new companies and creating new jobs. ""I think it's the next chapter for Cornwall,"" Melissa says. ""We were at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. We're not new to pioneering technologies."" But there's a wider ambition too. If this succeeds, it should help to position the UK as a leading place for space. However, this isn't the first attempt at creating a British launch industry. A white and red rocket, nicknamed ""the lipstick"", was supposed to be the start of something big for the UK. It blasted off in 1971, sending a satellite into space. The programme was called Black Arrow, and this was the first British-built rocket to deliver a British-built satellite into orbit - although it took off from Australia. But the costs were deemed too high by the government, so that first launch turned out to be the last. The UK's launch industry hit a long pause after this, but another aspect did take off in Britain - satellite building. And this has helped to drive a thriving space sector, which, according to a recent government report, is worth £16.5bn a year to the UK economy and employs nearly 50,000 people. ""We absolutely knock it out of the park when it comes to small satellite manufacture,"" says Dr Alice Bunn, CEO of UKSpace, the trade association of British space companies. Until now, she says, satellites built in the UK have had to be shipped abroad to get into space, but this first launch will change that. And it comes at a time when satellites have become integral to our lives - although Alice says most people are unaware of how dependent we are on this technology. ""Think about satellite navigation systems, environmental monitoring, emergency response - let alone all the telecommunications capability - that we can provide from space. It really is a running thread through our lives,"" she says. And some companies have big plans with this technology. The Cardiff-based company Space Forge thinks a whole host of new materials can be made in orbit. In a cleanroom, one of their small satellites is being painstakingly prepared for its journey. It's one of nine being sent into space by the Cornwall launch. Space Forge describe their shoe box-sized satellites as mini factories. ""In space, with the absence of gravity, you can mix together any different materials you want,"" says Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bacon. ""So if you take the whole periodic table, and start putting things together - like lead, aluminium, rubidium, einsteinium - there are billions of new alloys that you can now make that you couldn't make on Earth."" The new materials could be used in electric vehicles, green technology or computing, he explains. And he thinks there are some big advantages to launching these satellites close to their Welsh base. ''The fact that we can just drive down the road for a couple hours to get to our spaceport is a huge impact,"" Andrew says. But it's not just Cornwall racing to space. Amidst the bleakly beautiful undulating hills and jagged cliffs of the Shetland island of Unst, there's a hive of activity as diggers and dumper trucks come and go. The team here is celebrating because an important milestone has been reached. The concrete is setting on their first launch pad, one of three planned at the site. The SaxaVord Spaceport is being constructed on a peninsula jutting out into the sea, at the northernmost tip of the UK. ""I think the first response from the locals was that maybe it was an April Fool or something like that,"" says Debbie Strang, SaxaVord's chief operating officer. ""And then, as they've seen the progress and the development, there's been real excitement about what we've been doing."" There's a good reason why they've chosen such a remote place, where sheep and Shetland ponies outnumber the inhabitants. ""It's the safety element for us,"" says Debbie. ""What we're doing needs to be as far away as possible from population centres, so that when the rocket leaves, there's no real danger to people nearby."" SaxaVord is aiming for the UK's first vertical rocket launch to take satellites into orbit, with up to 30 launches a year once it's fully up and running. It's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland. Others are planned in Sutherland in the Highlands and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. The hope is that these could all boost local economies, and that's especially important in Unst. ""This island's suffered quite badly from depopulation over the last 20 or 30 years,"" explains Scott Hammond, the deputy CEO of SaxaVord. ""There was a small airfield here that used to be the third busiest heliport in the UK. And then they also had an RAF station here. ""When that left, it halved the population of the island and it clearly had a massive economic impact."" He hopes the spaceport could give the island a boost. ""We'll have more and more service jobs, during the fuelling of the rockets, for example, putting the liquid oxygen into the rockets. And those of course, will be highly paid, highly skilled jobs."" But if you're building a launchpad, you also need rockets - and SaxaVord is working with several companies looking to use Unst to blast off. One of these is Skyrora, based in Cumbernauld, just outside of Glasgow. Inside their vast hanger, the team is busy working on different rocket parts, from nose cones, to engines and containers for propellants. The company is making smaller prototypes, before building a larger rocket, Skyrora XL, that they plan to eventually launch from the Shetland Islands. ""You do a full design on paper and then you start building it. You build prototypes, you do tests, you go back to the drawing board and see what needs to be fixed,"" says Ahsan Zaman. He's just finished his aerospace degree, and says the new push for space in the UK is opening up opportunities for science and engineering graduates. He's proud to be working on the project. ""If we're successful, then we'll forever be known as the first people to do it in the UK. So yeah, it is an honour as well as exciting."" While the launch industry is just starting to come together in the UK, it's much better established in other parts of the world. And one company in particular now dominates the market: Elon Musk's SpaceX. With their reusable rockets, the company has massively cut the price of sending satellites into space. Can the raft of small new rocket companies compete? Skyrora's CEO Volodymyr Levykin says he wants his rockets to offer a more bespoke service. ""We want to be like a satellite taxi service,"" he explains. ""To launch whenever the customer wants us to launch and deliver them to an exact position they need to be in orbit."" He thinks because more and more small satellites are being built, the market to launch them will grow - but not every company will make it. ""Some of us, of course, will fail,"" he says. ""But there are some who are believers in this emerging market. And we decided to invest earlier rather than later, to be ready when the market actually will start to boom."" The UK government says it wants to push the space sector, and is investing in research and development. But UKSpace's Alice Bunn says the support needs to be long term. ""You will not become a global space player by investing in research and development alone. There has to be some kind of government commitment to ongoing operational capability."" She says this could mean the government signing up as a customer for launches, for example. ""We need to think a little bit creatively, industry and government working together, just to get us off the ground here."" All eyes are now on Cornwall, waiting for the first UK launch to blast off. It will be just the start for this new industry and there will be many challenges ahead. But as the well-known mantra goes, space is hard - and anyone working in this sector knows this. The hope is that with this high risk, comes the possibility of sky-high rewards. Follow Rebecca on Twitter.

In a sign of the scale of the problems facing the NHS, Rishi Sunak will spend Saturday focusing on how to ease the pressure on frontline services. But Mr Sunak has been warned that the rare weekend meeting is unlikely to reverse the NHS’ fortunes, which have been blamed on “years of inaction”. Senior doctors say the NHS is on a knife edge, with many A&E units struggling to keep up with demand and trusts and ambulance services declaring critical incidents. Discharge rates fell to a new low in England last week, with only a third of those patients ready to be released from hospital actually leaving. Mr Sunak, during a visit to a school on Friday, said he recognised that the NHS was “under enormous pressure”. No 10’s NHS Recovery Forum will see the Prime Minister hold talks with health experts about how to improve performance. Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Treasury minister John Glen, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden and the chief executive officer of NHS England Amanda Pritchard are also set to attend. The focus will be on four crucial issues: social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care, and primary care. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there were “no silver bullets” to solving the crisis currently being experienced at hospitals and other care centres. “This crisis has been a decade or more in the making and we are now paying the high price for years of inaction and managed decline,” said Mr Taylor. “Patients are experiencing delays that we haven’t seen for years. “High levels of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rising Covid levels are exacerbating the problem but the cause is decades of under-investment in staffing, capital and the lack of a long-term solution to the capacity-crunch facing social care. “None of these problems can be solved tomorrow.” The Prime Minister, in his first speech of 2023 on Wednesday, made reducing NHS waiting lists one of his key pledges before the next election, which is due to take place before 2025. Saturday’s Downing Street forum is expected to last most of the day. As well as ministers, attendees will include chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations, local areas and councils from across the country. Clinical experts from Royal Colleges and independent sector organisations working with health and social care services to deliver services for patients are also expected to join the Prime Minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “As the Prime Minister made clear this week, easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS is one of his key promises. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting branded the meeting a “talking shop”. The senior Labour figure said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor, a former Labour and Tony Blair aide, agreed with the criticism, saying the investment to improve discharge rates came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. He added: “Indeed, some local systems are still awaiting their allocation. “Any similar funding next year must be provided four to six months in advance so it can genuinely ease winter pressures.” On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet with union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year. However, Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen has told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” over the current settlement to prevent planned strikes. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll, of course, go to the meeting and make the case for nursing in all forums, but it’s sadly not what’s going to prevent strike action that’s planned for 10 days’ time. “I have put out an olive branch to get us to the table, I’m asking the Prime Minister now to meet the RCN halfway. The ball is firmly in the Prime Minister’s court.” A Department of Health and Social Care source said the Health Secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”.",Sunak to hold emergency No 10 talks in bid to ease winter care crisis,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/steve-barclay-matthew-taylor-nhs-wes-streeting-prime-minister-b2257731.html

The Prime Minister is hosting experts including England’s chief medical officer Professor Sir Chris Whitty and NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard in Downing Street. Labour said the talks, being joined by Health Secretary Steve Barclay and Treasury minister John Glen, are a “talking shop” and patients “deserve more”. Mr Sunak has been warned that the rare weekend meeting is unlikely to ease the pressure on frontline services, blamed on “years of inaction”. Senior doctors say the NHS is on a knife edge, with many A&E units struggling to keep up with demand and trusts and ambulance services declaring critical incidents. A wave of strikes and high levels of flu and coronavirus are adding to huge pressures in the health service. Discharge rates fell to a new low in England last week, with only a third of patients ready to be released from hospital actually leaving. Sir Chris and Ms Pritchard were seen arriving at No 10 on Saturday morning, with the “NHS Recovery Forum” set to last most of the day. The focus will be on four crucial issues: social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care and primary care. NHS Confederation chief executive Matthew Taylor said there are “no silver bullets” to solve the crisis after “decades of underinvestment”. “This crisis has been a decade or more in the making and we are now paying the high price for years of inaction and managed decline,” he said. “Patients are experiencing delays that we haven’t seen for years. “High levels of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rising Covid levels are exacerbating the problem but the cause is decades of underinvestment in staffing, capital and the lack of a long-term solution to the capacity crunch facing social care. “None of these problems can be solved tomorrow.” The Prime Minister this week made reducing NHS waiting lists one of his key pledges over the next two years. Attendees at the meeting were to include chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations and councils from across the country, as well as experts from medical royal colleges and independent sector organisations working in health and social care services. A Downing Street spokeswoman said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she said. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor said the investment came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year in talks that are unlikely to avert planned strikes. Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” to prevent industrial action.

The prime minister told health and social care leaders during an emergency summit in Downing Street on Saturday that it was a “collective responsibility” to free up hospital beds and slash ambulance waiting times. But Ms Cullen said his pledge will fail unless he gives her members a pay rise. She warned Mr Sunak the public would back nurses over the government if any were sacked as part of a new anti-strike crackdown and claimed the upcoming nurses’ walkout will be the biggest strike of its kind in the world. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Cullen also challenged the “out of touch” prime minister and health secretary Steve Barclay to work a 14-hour shift in a crisis-hit emergency ward. She said Mr Sunak could end the strikes this week if he takes up her offer to meet in the middle on pay, after saying she was willing to discuss a raise of 10 per cent instead of the 19 per cent originally asked for. During the crunch summit to solve the chaos engulfing English hospitals, Mr Sunak warned health leaders “business-as-usual mindset won’t fix the challenges we face”. England’s chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty and NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard were among those summoned for the rare weekend meeting. The prime minister is understood to be looking at ideas including the use of technology to help people stay out of hospital and increasing the number of “virtual wards”. He also highlighted that a small number of NHS trusts were responsible for a large proportion of serious issues, including long ambulance waits and waiting times for cancer care. Downing Street has said it will publish recovery plans to improve ambulance and A&E waiting times “in the coming weeks”. As Mr Sunak battles to bring the current crisis under control, Ms Cullen urged him to understand the scale of the upcoming nurses’ strike. A 48-hour walkout in England from 18 January will involve more hospitals than similar strikes last month’s action. She said: “We balloted around 320,000 nursing staff and my understanding is it has been the largest ballot of nursing staff in the world and it is the largest nursing strike in the world. We’ve also increased the number of organisations [such as NHS Trusts]. There are now 70 involved. First time around it was 46.” She also revealed that she had received messages of support from senior politicians in several European countries. December’s strikes were headline news in France, Italy, Spain and Austria among others. The world was “watching in dismay”, Ms Cullen said. She urged Mr Sunak to learn from the experience of other international leaders who were forced to back down in the face of ward walkouts, including Irish prime ministers in the first decade of this century. “What this government should look to is how the leader of [Ireland] stepped in very quickly and did not allow both of those strikes to go beyond the first few days,” she said. “And took immediate action. And that was because the public pressure was enormous.” On Wednesday, Mr Sunak set out his vision for the NHS, including a personal pledge to cut waiting lists. But he was criticised for offering nothing to end the current crisis or the strikes, which will also see ambulance staff take action later this month. “He made a broad, bold statement that he was going to cut waiting lists, but he won’t unless he addresses the crisis in nursing ... and the only way you are going to do that is to address the fundamental issue of nurses’ pay,” Ms Cullen said. Strike action will have to escalate if the government continues to ignore nurses, she said, although no decisions have yet been taken on what that would look like. Ms Cullen added: “He could bring it to a resolution this coming week – and avert industrial action. I will make myself available any night or any day. Let’s get round a table. Let’s have a discussion. “I think they owe that to the profession, to all those 320,000 nurses. And they owe it to every patient in this country, particularly those 7.2 million sitting on waiting lists year on year, to get around a table.” On Friday Mr Sunak refused to rule out that nurses could be sacked as part of his new crackdown, swerving the question in a broadcast interview. She described “any suggestion that they would sack any nurse… simply because nurses are standing up for their patients and the NHS” as “disheartening” given that there were currently 47,000 vacancies in the UK. Describing the prime minister as “out of touch” with the realities of the current crisis, she challenged Mr Sunak and his health secretary to work a 14-hour shift in an emergency department. She said: “From 7am to late into the evening, when a number of those hours will be unpaid, when the nurses should be off shift and home but they have no one to hand their patients on to. “They need to just walk in the shoes of those nurses for a few of those shifts. And I think that would make better decisions.” Leaving the NHS Recovery Forum on Saturday, consultant physician James Dunbar told reporters he was “confident that action will be taken” to address the crisis – but not optimistic it would be dealt with before spring. “These are difficult problems to fix though, so I think it’s unlikely we’ll have it sorted by the end of this winter,” he said. Dr Dunbar said that “a lot of” senior clinical leaders taking part were “saying the same thing”, adding: “The prime minister seemed to understand that.” Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Adrian Boyle meanwhile said the crisis is “fixable” and welcomed emergency care being “recognised as a priority”. A Downing Street spokesperson said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she added. A Department of Health and Social Care source said the health secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”. A government spokesperson said: “The health and social care secretary wants to have an honest conversation with unions, including the RCN, about what is affordable in pay settlements for next year during these challenging times, and is keen to meet for discussions as soon as possible. “We have accepted the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in full and have given over 1 million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. This is on top of a 3 per cent pay increase last year when public sector pay was frozen and wider government support with the cost of living.”",Rishi Sunak warned waiting list pledge will fail without NHS pay rise as he calls for ‘radical’ action,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/pat-cullen-nurses-rcn-strikes-b2257639.html

Here, we speak to just three of them. Volunteers at a vital community foodbank say that demand is surging with low-paid workers increasing reliant on it to make ends meet, writes Russell Blackstock. The facility at St Gregory’s Catholic Church, in Wyndford, Glasgow, is staffed entirely by unpaid helpers and is open five days a week. Unlike other foodbanks, St Gregory’s does not require users to provide a referral from an agency. It distributes free bags comprising up to 20 items including cereal, pasta, canned soup, tuna, tinned fruit, long-life milk and eggs. Toiletries, washing powder and washing-up liquid are also available. Co-ordinator Eileen Low said the number of people seeking help had soared by more than 30% since the pandemic’s peak while in the week before Christmas volunteers distributed a record number of bags. “We have just had our biggest ever week with 219 basic bags being handed out to help more than 500 individuals and families,” she said. “It is a grim new record to end the year with for us.” Low said that the foodbank’s clientele had also changed since the cost of living crisis started to bite this winter and many more working families were now seeking help. “When we started out five years ago, we were distributing between 30 and 40 bags weekly and it was usually to the most vulnerable people such as refugees, single pensioners and those with mental health or addiction issues,” she explained. “But now we are seeing more and more parents who have low-paid jobs such as cleaners and hospitality workers coming to us for help because they can’t pay the bills and feed their kids at the same time. “The working poor is a growing sector in our area and the government seems unable to do something constructive about it, so that’s where community-based charities come in. We are another safety net for people who are struggling financially and the authorities seem happy to let the likes of us pick up the slack. “It is obscene that this is happening in this day in age. At times we feel as though we are providing a new frontline service.” Ingrid Mitchell, who lives locally, has been volunteering at St Gregory’s for the past three years. She helps to shop for staples and hands out and delivers bags to foodbank users. The mother of two is a senior cabin crew member with a large airline, serving meals and drinks to passengers on transatlantic routes. She has been shocked by the surge in families seeking assistance from the foodbank. She said: “Many people feel embarrassed to ask for help but some have no other choice and they now rely on us. I have always been community minded and it is awful to see ordinary people in this situation. Sadly, I can’t see this crisis easing any time soon.” ‘We are warm and can offer a respite to what is going on’ No longer just a place to borrow books or study for exams, libraries are introducing a range of activities, clubs and groups to create “warm and welcoming spaces” that people can utilise during the cost of living crisis, writes Alice Hinds. From movie matinees and craft groups to mindful colouring-in sessions for adults and regular coffee mornings, library leaders say such innovative services provide a vital lifeline for people in the community who would otherwise struggle to find warm, comfortable and, importantly, free places to spend time during winter months. Ray Pattie, library adviser at Edinburgh Central Library, says the centres have always provided support for communities but new groups have become increasingly popular for people who may feel isolated or worried about spending money while socialising. “Our users see libraries as safe and reliable spaces,” he explained. “People just don’t have the disposable income now for sitting in Costa for hours and hours – that can turn into an expensive week, so they are looking for other things to do outside of the home. “That’s why we’re providing things like Knit And Natter, a weekly craft group, and adult colouring-in sessions, too. “The activities give people an opportunity to still come out and spend time with other people in a warm space but it’s more affordable than visiting a cafe. It’s an opportunity to meet new people as well. Since I’ve worked in libraries, it has very much been all about the community.” As well as introducing social groups, many of the Scottish capital’s libraries have also added social spaces to encourage people to visit for as long as they like. Replicating a living room with plants, comfortable seating, warm lighting and coffee tables, the areas also have free-to-use jigsaws and board games and a number of libraries have also included self-help guides on topics such as energy and money saving, and cooking on a budget. Hana Mackechnie, lifelong learning service manager for libraries in Edinburgh, said: “Some of our libraries are open 52 hours a week and you don’t need to come for a particular reason. “We’re finding that people want a space where they can spend a little bit longer, and somewhere they can also find signposting to benefits they might be entitled to, or get advice on how to access particular services. If you are a reader, you probably already feel like you’re welcome in a library but there’s so much more going on and we’re trying to introduce more activities.” Every weekday during winter, libraries across Edinburgh are also hosting movie matinees with free teas, coffees and refreshments, giving people another way to keep warm for a few hours. Acting library supervisor Natasha Gibson added: “We were already providing or about to introduce these initiatives but the situation now has brought more of a need for them and highlighted just how valuable they are for the community. “People are becoming more aware that, yes, libraries are also a place to come and be social and have a few minutes of respite from whatever is going on in life. “People do come to the library specifically to chat to people or get a change of scenery and at the moment it’s a much-needed place away from home that’s warm – both in terms of the physical surroundings and the people that are here.” ‘It is sad to see so many people struggling’ Demand for free furniture, school uniforms and even haircuts is on the rise at a community-based initiative in south-west Scotland, writes Russell Blackstock. The Furniture Project in Stranraer was originally set up to recycle, repair and provide refurbished household goods at affordable prices. But the charity, which has more than 20 volunteers and runs two shops, has also turned to providing household items and services for free to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. “We started running Freebie Friday events that are proving to be hugely popular,” said boss Paul Smith. “These include giving away items like furniture and household appliances and demand has been high. “So many low-income workers who wouldn’t normally be struggling are now coming to us because the price of everything has risen so much that they simply can’t make ends meet. “I suppose we are doing what the likes of parish organisations and local authorities might have done in the past.” Other popular services provided by the charity include organising free school uniforms and haircuts for children whose parents are struggling to get by. “A new school blazer alone can cost between £40 and £50 and if you have three kids in the house, that is a big expense for any family,” said Smith. “People can come to our shop and discreetly get a school uniform for nothing, and we run this service all through the school year. We have also started a project involving local hairdressers so that kids can get haircuts for free because, again, this can be expensive if you have a number of children in the house. “We try to help to make sure that these kids don’t feel any different from friends at school who come from better-off backgrounds. “It is sad to see so many people struggling financially at the moment but I grew up on a housing scheme that was regarded as being poor and we had to put up with hand-me-downs, so I know what that is like.” The organisation also recycles bicycles and gifts that would usually go to landfill, and sells them cheaply to people once they have been refurbished. Also, it provides a mentoring service that enables retired people to pass on skills and knowledge to youngsters so that they can find jobs in areas such as warehousing and customer services. Smith said even middle-income families were now using the project to inexpensively replace big-ticket household items such as fridges, cookers and furniture as the cost of living crisis deepens. He added: “Previously, you could almost categorise those using services like ours as being among the most vulnerable in our community but the financial pressures are now adding up for people right across the board. “We are now increasingly helping the sort of folk that we normally wouldn’t expect to see.”","Community foodbank: In this day and age, it is obscene we are so needed as a safety net for people",https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/foodbanks-warmbanks/

Being the prime minister, he must have thought, has to amount to more than acknowledging a terrifying array of looming crises. When asked what you hope to do with your time in office, you’ve got to give a more inspiring answer than “cope”, even if you’re fortunate in following a leader who didn’t even manage that. What would be a clear, constructive, positive, yet achievable, initiative? Nothing fun at this bleak time – any whiff of levity could be accused of trivialising people’s suffering. And nothing that sounds expensive. Also nothing that sounds too leftwing, what with the Tory right calling Sunak a socialist for failing to cut taxes. But nothing that sounds too rightwing either, what with the Labour party being so far ahead in the polls. Plus there are many subject areas to avoid: health, transport, defence, the economy… Probably best if it doesn’t touch on any other countries, what with Brexit being such a sore point and China getting horribler and Russia obviously. And there’s the whole illegal immigration shitstorm, so maybe steer clear of abroad altogether. Also food and fuel and housing would be good areas not to mention. Plus it shouldn’t be something that sounds difficult or people won’t believe it’s going to happen. And it shouldn’t be anything that anyone cares too much about because, its achievability notwithstanding, it still probably won’t happen. What should it be? I’d have been stumped. My best idea was: “Every hard-working family will be given a free cactus.” They could sit on kitchen tables, as symbols of bristly resilience, while people try to work out how to pay the mortgages on their freezing homes. Little green shoots of spiny recovery sprouting all over an economic wasteland. Sunak went another way. He fell back on something he could rely on, the solace of many a swot in the face of moral complexity, myself included: maths. You know where you are with maths. Maths doesn’t let you down. Maths doesn’t go on strike, or arrive uninvited on the south coast, or die because it couldn’t get an ambulance, or send bullying texts, or appear on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. Let’s do more maths! That was his new initiative. Everyone should be studying maths until the age of 18, he declared. Who can argue with that? Eight million adults in the UK are only numerate to primary school level. That’s bad. But brilliantly, all those potential voters, who presumably hate maths, won’t have to do any at all, but only agree with the principle that they should have done more previously. No one who can vote will have to do anything they don’t want to. This is an entirely inoffensive policy. The education secretary, who my investigations tell me is called Gillian Keegan, might feel aggrieved that it doesn’t leave her with much to say in her next speech. Michael Gove used to have great fun with that brief – handing out bibles and making everyone read Thomas Hardy and memorise dates – and even Gavin Williamson got to cancel everyone’s exams. The importance of maths should be something Keegan gets to bang on about to easy applause, but the PM has nicked it because every single other policy area has gone toxic. But he was determined to make it sound massive: “This is personal for me,” it was reported that he was “expected to say” in his speech. And he did! “It’s the single most important reason why I came into politics: to give every child the highest possible standard of education.” Wow – it turns out he’s a stealth educationist. He was also expected to say: “Just half of all 16-19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills is letting our children down.” Admirable sentiments, though the phrase “our children’s jobs” raises the spectre of child labour. An unfortunate slip when families are struggling to afford food and fuel and the sick are left untreated. It’s all getting a bit Dickensian. But perhaps it’s deliberate. Is this heritage austerity? Back to when Britain was great? Perhaps by “studying maths” he means “doing data entry”? Good work for children with their nimble fingers, and much safer than picking fluff out of an industrial loom, so we must count our blessings. It was a slip because, of all the things he was “expected to say”, the phrase about “children’s jobs” was the only one he didn’t. Very wise. Bless him, he just wanted to say “children” as many times as possible. A focus group must have generated that finding: saying “children” is a good look for him. Better than for Truss the malfunctioning robot or Johnson the philanderer, who just kept having children. Sunak’s children look nice – he’s shared some lovely photos – it’s a relatable family unit. Keep saying “children”, Rishi, and people will believe you care. I approve of the maths plan, but it’s such a tiny thought. In most countries that we increasingly laughably consider our equivalents, maths up to the age of 18 has long been compulsory. Rather than having an idea, he’s just picked one of myriad ways in which Britain is worse than elsewhere and resolved to correct it. It’s like saying: “We really ought to start brushing our teeth.” A small, long-overdue correction to our educational practices coming from the leader of a party that’s been in power for 12 years. It’s lame. And it won’t happen. Sunak says he “will work with the sector to move towards all children studying some form of maths to 18”. “Work with” to “move towards”. Christ. Don’t hold your breath. As Keegan’s shadow, Bridget Phillipson, put it: “He cannot deliver this reheated, empty pledge without more maths teachers, yet the government has missed their target for new maths teachers year after year.” More teachers requires more money. The money must either be raised or moved from elsewhere. That means fewer missiles or nurses or tax cuts or more taxes. Perhaps maths will let him down after all.",More maths?

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and Aslef took industrial action which crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Union leaders will meet rail minister Huw Merriman as they continue to insist the Government is blocking a deal to end the long-running row over pay, jobs and conditions. Transport Secretary Mark Harper denies the allegation, saying he is facilitating talks between unions and employers. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Today I want to see the Government stop play-acting because the truth, written in black and white in their rail contracts, is that they’ve been in complete control of this dispute from day one. “The train operators cannot move without Government say-so. “Passengers, workers and businesses are suffering and even rail company managers are beginning to break ranks in despair at the Government’s approach. “The minister cannot hide behind this fairy story that he is just a facilitator. “His Government can end this dispute today by taking out the conditions they put in to torpedo a resolution and let the companies make a deal.” Meanwhile, Aslef leaders will consider an offer – made on Friday by the Rail Delivery Group on behalf of train operators – of a 4% pay rise for last year and 4% this year. Conditions were attached to the offer, such as speeding up the training of drivers, as well as over Sunday working arrangements. Rail union and industry officials will give evidence to the Transport Select Committee on Wednesday. A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The Transport Secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. “They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. “Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation and costing every household an extra £1,000.”",Union leaders to meet rail minister in bid to secure deal to end strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-mark-harper-mick-lynch-huw-merriman-rmt-b2258343.html

Last year was chaotic for domestic politics, with upheaval at Westminster and long-running argument at Holyrood on the constitution. Here are just five of the big problems and promises you want sorted for 2023. 1. Fix the NHS NHS Grampian took the desperate step of putting out an urgent social media appeal for staff off-duty or on holiday to come in to work over the festive period. And NHS Highland has warned Raigmore and Belford Hospitals are “very busy” and expressed concerns over a surge in flu patients. Patients across the north and north-east have also struggled to access their GP with one Aberdeen doctor revealing he is seeing three times the safe number of patients “on an almost-daily basis”. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf is facing mounting pressure to come forward with a recovery plan. He says Covid backlogs, rising cases of flu and Strep A, delayed discharged and cold weather are “all compounding” the usual pressures on the health service. The SNP minister is expected to deliver a statement addressing concerns at Holyrood on Tuesday. Meanwhile, NHS Grampian is waiting for an extra £7 million a year required to help more Moray women give birth in Elgin. Campaigners in Caithness continue to raise concerns over the lack of women’s healthcare in the county, with women facing 100-mile journeys to Inverness for treatment. 2. Will the A9 and A96 be dualled? It was confirmed just days before Christmas that a final decision on fully dualling the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness will not be made until well into next year. The SNP promised over a decade ago to dual the route by 2030. But this was thrown into doubt when the Scottish Greens were brought into government in 2021. An open survey of P&J readers, published on January 6, revealed the vast majority of respondents want the A96 dualled all the way. A project to dual the A9 between Inverness and Perth has also been hit by serious delays but the government has yet to give an update on its 2025 target completion date. Pressure on the SNP Government is intensifying after 13 people died on the stretch due to be dualled between the two cities. 3. We need better ferries Furious islanders from the Hebrides to Shetland have warned locals are packing up and quitting their communities in response to the “utterly chaotic” ferry system. The construction of two new ferries, MV Glen Sannox and Hull 802, is well behind schedule and over budget. The vessels, which were originally commissioned in 2015 from struggling shipyard Fergus Marine, are now years late and over a hundred million pounds over budget. The Holyrood inquiry continues but already the SNP is promising more. 4. Whatever happened to Freeports? Three locations across the north-east, Highlands and islands are vying for “green freeport” status from the UK and Scottish governments. Freeports get special tax status and are being promoted as job-creating goldmines. Others fear they are light on regulation and attractive to money launderers. A joint bid by Aberdeen and Peterhead ports is going up against bids by Cromarty Firth and Orkney for the two coveted spots. But bidders have been left in the dark since the summer over who will secure the special tax status, with Scottish Secretary Alister Jack admitting months ago that a decision has already been made. It is understood the ever-changing leadership of the Tory party delayed the announcement last year. 5. What is the future for oil and gas? The SNP conference in October seemed to finally push the future of oil and gas workers to the top of the agenda. Taking place in Aberdeen, Ms Sturgeon said her government has a “duty” to support workers into new green jobs. But there has been a lack of detail on the practicalities. Energy Secretary Michael Matheson is slated to deliver a statement on Scotland’s long-awaited energy strategy and “just transition” plan on Tuesday. The latter will focus on the offshore workforce, Mr Matheson told the Press and Journal last year. Energy policy is reserved to the UK Government and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will have a key role in charting the future of the oil and gas sector, from the licensing of future oil fields to the windfall tax.",5 problems people across the north of Scotland want politicians to fix in 2023,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/5243446/nhs-freeports-a9-a96-oil-gas-ferries/

The deck machinery specialist – based at Towie Barclay Works, near Turriff – is enjoying growth in the offshore floating wind market. Our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Alfie Cheyne, founder and chairman, Ace Winches. Growing demand in energy markets in both North America and the Middle East are also driving the business forward, it said. Ace Winches, whose many accolades over the years include prestigious Queen’s Awards in 2010 and 2013, has formed a subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates as part of its global growth strategy. And earlier this year it announced the opening of a subsidiary in Houston, Texas. Underlying earnings up 38% Chairman Alfie Cheyne said a strong financial performance during the 12 months to March 31 last year was a foundation “which bodes well for the future”. The company reported pre-tax profits of £4.5 million – down from £7.8m for the previous year, when results were boosted by the reversal of a £4.8m write-down. Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation raced ahead to £7.6m last year, up by 38% from £5.5m previously. Ownership tussle The most recent figure excludes one-off costs associated with a change of ownership, Turnover increased slightly to £28.3m, up from just shy of £28m the year before. Ace Winches’ 58-year-old chairman founded the business in 1992 but lost control of it to Balmoral Group in stages between 2017 and 2019. The relationship with Aberdeen-based Balmoral eventually turned sour and Mr Cheyne and his wife, Valerie, reacquired the firm in late 2021. Reflecting on 2021-22, Mr Cheyne said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. “It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is.” He added: “In this reporting period we have made an additional investment of £1.3m in our rental fleet in line with our twin objectives of diversification and geographic expansion. “It has been a year marked by significant growth and change – growth in the renewables market and a change in how we interact with our customers. “This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet, thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Green ambitions Mr Cheyne also highlighted the firm’s green credentials after it became carbon neutral. Operations at Towie Barclay Works are now powered by wind. On the firm’s wider green ambitions, chief commercial officer Gary Wilson said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East are indicators of our strategy going forward.” With more than 3,000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, Ace Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and other services in multiple sectors. Headcount averaged 155 during the 12 months to March 2022, down from 171 the year before. Mrs Cheyne, chief compliance officer, said the company was growing its workforce again. She added: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our graduate engineer numbers, providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.”",Ace Winches sets sights on global growth after &#8216;strong&#8217; results,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/local/5245423/ace-winches-sets-sights-on-global-growth-after-strong-results/

Earlier, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “happy to talk about pay” with unions as ministers held a series of meetings aimed at ending a wave of industrial unrest in the NHS and on the rail network. However, both the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” Unite said any suggestion that a one-off pay reward could be made in exchange for a boost in productivity was “absolutely ludicrous”. While other trade unions said that “progress” had been made, there was no sign that enough had been made for planned strikes to be called off. Unite negotiator Onay Kasab, speaking after a meeting with Mr Barclay, accused the Government of telling staff they would need to “justify” a payment through productivity. “This isn’t a factory we’re talking about, we’re talking about people who are working well beyond their contracted hours anyway just to get the job done because they care so much. “So, for the Government to be talking about productivity in exchange for a (payment) is an insult to every single one of our members.” Mr Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. Alongside talks with health unions, teaching unions were holding talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan ahead of announcements this week over whether their members will go on strike. Rail minister Huw Merriman called in train workers after sustained action crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Mr Kasab said: “I emphasise the thing to get out of today that is absolutely clear is that they want our members to give more in order for it to consider a payment. That is absolutely outrageous.” He said there had been no “detailed” discussion of what a pay settlement might look like, adding that the talks had left him “very angry”. He added: “The Government have missed yet another opportunity. We came here in good faith.” After the meeting, the GMB said that ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday, adding that the talks “fell well short” of anything needed to stop the walk-out. More than 10,000 GMB members are expected by the trade union to take to picket lines on Wednesday. “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis,” said Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary. “The public expects the Government to treat these talks seriously – it’s time they got on with it.” Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, told reporters that “progress” had been made but said there had been no “tangible” concessions. “It was a very civil meeting. We did actually manage to talk about pay – we didn’t get the tangible concessions that we might have hoped for that would enable us to call off the strikes later this week. “But it was definitely progress when you’re in a room with the Secretary of State talking about pay, I think. “He’s asked for our help to help with the Treasury to make the case for investment. We’ll certainly do that.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks. Elaine Sparkes, assistant director at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Although the meeting was more constructive this time, there is nothing tangible on the table. “As such, we’ll be announcing the first of our strike dates later this week as we continue to push for a fairer deal for our members and their colleagues.” The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement. On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”. “On pay, we’ve always said that the Government is happy to talk about pay demands and pay issues that are anchored in what’s reasonable, what’s responsible, what’s affordable for the country.” Downing Street earlier warned that concerns about inflation had not gone away as the Government prepares for the next round of pay talks for 2023/24. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Government was open to listening to trade unions’ concerns. “We are happy to listen to the pressures they think they are under, what they think is fair, responsible and affordable, and likewise we will provide detail about what we think is affordable, and also the challenge that inflation poses to all of this as well.” Elsewhere, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch dodged questions about progress in rail talks but said that further discussions would take place. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, gave a shrugging gesture as he left the Department for Transport but also declined to give any detail of the meeting. The National Education Union said that “no concrete progress” had been made in its talks with the education secretary. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “While there is the thought of further meetings, there is no sense of concrete progress as yet. There is no offer, there is no change. “There are further discussions to happen that we will engage in while still urging our members to vote in the ballot.” Mr Courtney added: “There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action because we think these meetings are only happening because of the threat of industrial action.” Business Secretary Grant Shapps has said ministers were seeking a more “collaborative approach”, telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “It is a new year.

""This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success. “We have a long tradition of focusing on the environment, and I am proud to say we reached our goal to be carbon neutral in this past year, with operations at our headquarters having been conducted using wind power.” Chief Financial Officer Alastair Scott added: “The increase in EBITDA excluded one-off costs associated with change of ownership in November 2021, while the figures for the year to March 2021 have also been restated to reverse the effects of a previous financial impairment which is no longer required. “The positive EBITDA results demonstrate the success of the business strategy and allow continued investment into the rental fleet.” Valerie Cheyne, Chief Compliance Officer, said: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our Graduate Engineer numbers providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.” Increasing demand for safe high-quality products and operational delivery in North America and the Middle East has propelled the company’s international strategy and operational activities, which are expected to further strengthen the group’s financial results in 2022/23. As part of that ambition, ACE has formed a subsidiary company in the United Arab Emirates, ensuring the range of high-quality services from concept design through to manufacture, equipment rental and further support, is delivered globally. Chief Commercial Officer Gary Wilson​ said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East, are indicators of our strategy going forward, as we place a focus on areas of opportunity where our capabilities and solutions single us out as a contractor of choice. “We have a strong reputation that has been built up through our commitment to innovation and investing in our people and services over the last 30 years, and we are looking forward to bringing that expertise to more of our customers in North America and the Middle East, as well as markets we already serve.” With more than 3000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, ACE Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and deploying solutions across multiple sectors.

The Jamesfield development is a joint venture with Harmony Energy, following TagEnergy’s acquisition of a 60% stake in the project in November 2021. It will use a system of Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries, together with Tesla’s Autobidder software for real-time trading and control. It is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter this year, with renewable energy company RES as asset manager. Franck Woitiez, chief executive of TagEnergy, said the company's third battery energy storage facility in the UK reinforced its commitment to the country and its green energy goals. “This is another important milestone in TagEnergy’s growth in the UK as we leverage our strong storage expertise to support the UK grid and propel the nation to net-zero carbon emissions by connecting more competitive renewable power. “We are excited to enter this next phase in the project in partnership with Harmony Energy and with the support of Santander UK as we grow our UK footprint to accelerate the energy transition.” Mark Cumbo, director of specialised and project finance at Santander UK, said: “This follows the funding we provided TagEnergy in 2021 to support Hawkers Hill Energy Park in Dorset, and to TagEnergy and Harmony Energy in 2022 for Chapel Farm near Luton. “Santander UK strongly supports clients such as TagEnergy and Harmony Energy that are bringing additional capacity to enable greater contribution from renewables to the UK’s energy sector.” Peter Kavanagh, chief executive of Harmony Energy, said: “We have been working on this site for over four years and are delighted to be progressing to this next stage with TagEnergy, following our partnership which was announced in 2021. “Securing debt funding from Santander UK demonstrates a growing appetite from institutions to support battery developments and we look forward to working with it.” Jamesfield is the third TagEnergy investment in battery storage facilities in the UK to reach financial close following its entry into the UK market in 2021. Commissioning of its first project, Hawkers Hill Energy Park, took place in September and construction of its second project, Chapel Farm, started last February. Jamesfield, Chapel Farm and Hawkers Hill, together with previously-announced projects Roaring Hill in Fife, Lakeside in North Yorkshire and more recently, Pitkevy in Scotland, take TagEnergy’s secured portfolio in the UK to date to 320MW/640MWh. TagEnergy partnered with Balance Power in October to build, own, and operate 500MW of Balance Power’s renewable energy pipeline requiring an investment of more than £300m over the next four years. Since its formation in 2019, TagEnergy has assembled a portfolio of close to 4GW based on solar, wind and battery storage technologies in the UK, Portugal, Spain, France and Australia.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Mr Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. The Health Secretary suggested that improvements in efficiency and productivity could “unlock additional funding” for the 2023/24 pay settlement, but unions want workers paid more now, raising the possibility of a one-off lump sum to help with the soaring cost of living. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” The GMB union said ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday after the talks “fell short”. Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary, said: “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks.

The source said talk about productivity and efficiency improvements had been linked to the 2023/24 pay settlement, rather than a one-off payment. In the Commons, Mr Barclay told MPs: “It is right that we are engaging with the trade unions, I was pleased to meet the staff council of the NHS today and indeed the chair of the NHS Staff Council, Sara Gorton, said the discussions had made progress. “Notwithstanding one trade union leader who wasn’t in the talks giving an interview outside the department to comment on what had and had not been said in those talks, but we want to work constructively with the trade unions on that.” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. An ally of Mr Barclay said the issue of a one-off payment was raised at the meeting by the unions, rather than the Health Secretary, who “listened to what he had to say and agreed to take it away”. The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement. On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”.

It follows recent articles on inflation, energy, food and the cost of living. Canada: assertive unions getting results Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Canada’s trade union movement is among the more resilient in the OECD, the club of developed countries. This is related to laws that prevent “free riding”, which is where workers can benefit from collective agreements without being union members. Union density in Canada has been around 30% of workers since the turn of the century, although membership in the private sector is barely half that and slowly falling. In contrast, unionisation is high in public services (over 75%) and growing. This relatively stability has left Canadian workers better prepared to confront the impact of inflation on their wages. Unions made higher wage demands than in recent decades, and more frequently went on strike (continuing a trend from 2021). From January to October 2022, there were 145 strikes, and the final year tally will likely exceed the 161 in 2021 – itself a marked increase. A total of 1.9 million person-days of work were lost in strikes up to October (the highest in 15 years). Unlike in recent years, the majority were in the private sector. A spring wave of strikes in construction in Ontario (Canada’s most populous province) symbolised the increased militancy. At peak, over 40,000 workers downed tools for higher wages, including carpenters, dry-wallers and engineers. Tentative agreements reached by officials were sometimes rejected by members, prolonging the strikes. A second historic flash point came later in the year when Ontario’s right-wing government invoked a rarely used constitutional clause to override the right to strike for 55,000 education support workers. After unions in the public and private sector threatened a province-wide general strike, the government backed down. Meanwhile, employer lockouts have virtually disappeared. This tactic, in which employers suspend operations until workers agree to terms being offered, had only been used eight times by October, compared to 60 per year a decade ago. Annual wage growth increased modestly to an average of 5% by late in the year. That still lagged the 6.8% inflation, but closed the gap from 2021. It remains to be seen whether this union pressure can be sustained in the face of rapid interest rate increases, a likely recession in 2023, and continued government suppression of union rights in some provinces. United Kingdom: an olive branch for the health service? Phil Tomlinson, Professor of Industrial Strategy, University of Bath The UK’s latest winter of discontent is extending into 2023 as the country endures its largest wave of strikes in over 30 years. Most are in the public sector, where pay offers are well below inflation and significantly lag private companies. The sense of grievance is high following the austerity and real-terms pay cuts of the 2010s. Strikes – estimated to have cost the UK economy £1.7 billion in 2022 – are being co-ordinated across different unions, adding to the public inconvenience. The UK government has steadfastly refused to yield, however. It has hidden behind independent recommendations by public-sector pay review bodies, despite not always following them. They have also claimed that inflation matching public sector pay rises would cost each UK household an extra £1,000 a year, though this figure has been debunked. The Treasury also echoes Bank of England concerns about setting off a wage-price spiral. Yet this is unlikely, given the current inflation is largely down to supply shocks (from COVID and the war in Ukraine), while average wage growth is well below inflation. There is an economic case for a generous deal, especially in the National Health Service (NHS): with over 133,000 unfilled vacancies, better wages might help improve staff retention and recruitment. Of course, funding this in a recession involves tough choices. Higher taxes would be politically difficult with the tax burden at a 70-year high. Higher government borrowing could aggravate inflation if accommodated by the Bank of England increasing the money supply through more quantitative easing. Public opinion appears largely sympathetic to the strikes, especially in the NHS. But if the government relents in one sector, it sets a precedent for others, with potentially wider economic consequences. For the NHS, it may instead bring forward public sector pay review body negotiations for 2023 to allow for an improved deal – possibly alongside a one-off hardship payment. Elsewhere it will probably hold firm and hope the trade unions lose their resolve. Australia and New Zealand: strikes remain rare despite inflation Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Strikes in Australia have become very rare in recent decades, thanks to restrictive labour laws passed since the 1990s. Despite historically low unemployment and wages lagging far behind inflation, these laws continue to short-circuit most industrial action. In 2022, union density fell to 12.5% of employees, an all-time low. As recently as 1990, union density was over 50% of workers. Union members can legally strike only after negotiations, ballots and specific plans for action have been publicly divulged (thus fully revealing union strategy to the employer). Even when there are strikes, they tend to be short. A total of 182 industrial disputes occurred in the year to September. (The statistics don’t distinguish between strikes and employer lockouts, which have become common in Australia.) This is similar to the pre-COVID years, following a drop in 2020, and only a fraction of 1970s and 1980s industrial action. The only visible increase in strike action in 2022 was a series of one-day protest strikes organised by teachers and health care workers in New South Wales, the country’s most populous state. Having put up with a decade of austere wage caps by the conservative state government, they decided they had had enough as inflation picked up. Most other workers have been passive despite Australia experiencing among the slowest wage growth of any major industrial country. Nominal wages grew just 2% per year over the decade to 2021. That rose to 3.1% by late 2022, but it’s still less than half the 7.3% inflation rate. Australia’s newly elected Labor government did pass a series of important labour law reforms at the end of 2022, aimed at strengthening collective bargaining and wage growth. That might herald incremental improvement in workers’ bargaining power in the years ahead. The industrial relations outlook in New Zealand is somewhat more hospitable for workers and their unions. Union density increased in 2021, to 17% of employees (from 14% in 2020). Average ordinary hourly earnings grew an impressive 7.4% in the latest 12-month period – helped by a 6% boost in the minimum wage by New Zealand’s Labour government. Industrial action remains rare – perhaps in part because workers are successfully lifting wages via other means. No official strike data is available for 2022, but in 2021, just 20 work stoppages occurred, down sharply from an average of 140 per year in the previous three years. Indonesia: anger against labour law reforms Nabiyla Risfa Izzati, Lecturer of Labour Law, Universitas Gadjah Mada A few weeks ago, the government replaced its controversial “omnibus law” with new emergency regulation. This was in response to the Indonesian constitutional court finding it unconstitutional in 2021. Passed in late 2020, the omnibus law embodies President Joko Widodo’s ambition to attract foreign investors by slashing red tape at the cost of employees’ rights. It made it easier for businesses to lay off employees without prior notice. It also lowered statutory severance pay and extended the maximum length of temporary contracts, while ignoring worker safety. In 2022, its new formula to determine the minimum wage also resulted in the lowest annual increase ever. The law attracted much criticism from workers, activists and civil society organisations. The new emergency regulation is arguably even more problematic. The majority of its provision simply copies the omnibus law. Several changes and additional provisions are confusing and overlap with previous regulations, as well as leaving many loopholes that could be exploited in future. Yet despite complaints from workers and trade unions that the new rules were passed suddenly and without consultation, strike action is out of the question. Strikes are not popular because they can only be organised with permission from the company in question. If labourers hold informal strikes, employers also entitled to get rid of them. Public protests are the obvious alternative, though pandemic rules restricting mobility and mass gatherings have made these difficult. Nevetheless, thousands or perhaps even millions of workers staged protests in their respective cities in the second half of 2022. The workers wanted the omnibus law revoked, and for the government to not use the minimum wage formulations stipulated in the law. The demonstrations got more intense as the government raised subsidised fuel prices in September, which boosted already high inflation due to rising food prices. The government has since issued a separate regulation to determine the 2023 minimum wage, so the demands were successful, although both workers and employers are furious that the minimum wage rules have changed again under the emergency regulation. Clearly the protesters did not see the rest of the rules in the omnibus law removed. Some workers have been protesting on social media. This might not induce the government to change the law, but a few viral tweets have pushed several businesses to change abusive practices. The controversy is likely to continue in 2023 and into the election year of 2024, especially amid possible massive layoffs in the midst of a global recession. United States: worker protest showing signs of life Marick Masters, Professor of Business and Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Wayne State University US workers organised and took to the picket line in increased numbers in 2022 to demand better pay and working conditions, leading to optimism among labour leaders and advocates that they’re witnessing a turnaround in labour’s sagging fortunes. Teachers, journalists and baristas were among tens of thousands of workers who went on strike. And it took an act of Congress to prevent 115,000 railroad employees from walking out as well. In total, there have been at least 20 major work stoppages involving upwards of 1,000 workers each in 2022, up from 16 in 2021, plus hundreds more that were smaller. Workers at Starbucks, Amazon, Apple and dozens of other companies also filed over 2,000 petitions to form unions during the year – the most since 2015. Workers won 76% of the 1,363 elections that were held. Historically, however, these figures are tepid. The number of major work stoppages has been plunging for decades, from nearly 200 as recently as 1980. As of 2021, union membership was at about the lowest level on record, at 10.3%. In the 1950s, over one in three workers belonged to a union. The deck is still heavily stacked against unions, with unsupportive labour laws and very few employers showing real receptivity to having a unionised workforce. Unions are limited in how much they can change public policy. Reforming labour law through legislation has remained elusive, and the results of the 2022 midterms are not likely to make it easier. Nonetheless, public support for labour is at its highest since 1965, with 71% saying they approve of unions, according to a Gallup poll in August. And workers themselves are increasingly showing an interest in joining them. In 2017, 48% of workers polled said they would vote for union representation, up from 32% in 1995, the last time the question was asked. Future success may depend on unions’ ability to tap into their growing popularity and emulate the recent wins in establishing union representation at Starbucks and Amazon, as well as the successful “Fight for $15” campaign, which since 2012 has helped pass US$15 minimum wage laws in a dozen states and Washington DC. The odds may be steep, but the seeds of opportunity are there if labour can exploit them. This is an excerpt from an article published on January 5 2023. France: militant unions risk going too far Stéphanie Matteudi-Lecocq, Chercheuse au LEREDS, Directrice practice Chez Alixio, Université de Lille France in 2022 saw new industrial protests, from blockades of oil refineries, to unprecedented strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants, to rail workers staying at home on public holidays. TotalEnergies announced “super profits” in the second quarter of 2022 and increased CEO Patrick Pouyanné’s salary by 52% to €5,944,129. In September the militant CGT union demanded a 10% salary increase for workers and called for a strike at the group’s refineries. Five of Total’s refineries went on strike, joined by two owned by ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso. Esso was already talking to its unions about a pay deal, but Total had only planned to open negotiations in November. The strikes in the refineries threatened to bring France to a standstill, and the CGT used its power over this key resource to demand that discussions begin more quickly with Total (in the end, the company negotiated earlier and pay deals were done, ending the strikes by early November). The strike at EDF’s nuclear power stations similarly gave the company’s workers the balance of power because it made it impossible for France to build up energy reserves (since fossil fuels had to be burned to make up for the lack of nuclear power). In the end, the company signed deals with the unions in October. Unions may have succeeded in both cases, but they are arguably endangered by these kinds of practices. Too many trades union leaders remain stuck in their old militant ways. There’s a fragile balance between negotiation and protest, and such ransom tactics might damage unions’ public image, making dialogue more difficult in future. In 50 years, the rate of unionisation in France has already halved from over 20% to around 10%. It’s telling that two of the major strikes at the end of 2022, first by train workers and then by general practitioners, were initiated by groups independent from the unions. They both started spontaneously through social media and the unions found out very late. In 2023 the unions have an opportunity to improve their influence if they manage to prevent the government from passing its unpopular bill on pensions, which seeks to raise the full pensionable retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65. The unions have already announced their strong opposition to the bill. With major demonstrations due to take place after the full bill is presented today, January 10, it will be interesting to see their tactics. This is based on an excerpt from an article published in October 2022. Spain: unequal support measures could cause trouble Rubén Garrido-Yserte, Director del Instituto Universitario de Análisis Económico y Social, Universidad de Alcalá Global inflation is triggering a global economic slowdown and interest rates raised to levels not seen since before 2008. Interest rates will continue to rise in 2023, especially affecting economies as indebted as Spain. It will undermine both families’ disposable income and the profitability of companies (especially small ones), while making public debt repayments more expensive. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to cause a sustained increase in the cost of the shopping basket in the medium term. Government measures have partially mitigated this loss of purchasing power so far. Spain capped power prices, subsidised fuel and made public transport free for urbanites and commuters. There were agreements with banks to refinance mortgages for the most vulnerable families. Plus there have been increases in pensions and public salaries and there are plans to raise the minimum wage. However, many of these measures must necessarily be temporary. The danger is that they come to be seen as rights that should not be renounced. They also distort the economy and create problems with fairness by excluding or insufficiently supporting some groups. Private salaries will not rise enough to cover inflation, for instance. The government’s measures have been such that there has been very little industrial action in response to the cost of living crisis. The danger is that they create a scenario where today’s calm may be the harbinger of a social storm tomorrow.

Ms Somerville said there is still “some distance” between the two sides in the pay dispute. On Tuesday, primary schools around the country closed after last-ditch talks failed to prevent strike action, with secondary school staff set to walk out on Wednesday. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. A meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT), which brings together unions, local authorities and the Scottish Government, took place on Monday in an attempt to avert the strike action. As the Scottish Parliament resumed following the winter recess, Conservative Stephen Kerr spoke about the SNCT meeting. He said: “Teachers are on strike for the first time in 40 years, because this SNP Government has repeatedly let them down.” Ms Somerville said it had been “constructive”, adding that she could not give further details while negotiations are ongoing. Referring to “anti-trade union” legislation at Westminster, she continued: “I will take no lectures from Mr Kerr or any other Conservative member of this parliament, saying that we should be doing more to actually settle disputes.” The Lib Dems’ Willie Rennie asked if there would be a new offer for teachers, saying: “The Education Secretary does seem to be very chilled out and relaxed.” Ms Somerville said both sides in the dispute would have to compromise in order to reach a resolution, adding: “We will, of course, leave no stone unturned to try and do that as quickly as possible. “No one wants to see strike action in our schools.” Speaking on BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland programme earlier, Ms Somerville described the union pay demands as “simply unaffordable”.

It follows SSTA and NASUWT members taking two days of action in December while EIS members walked out on November 24. Asked whether she expected a new offer to be on the table before the end of the week, Ms Somerville said: “We’ll continue discussions with the unions. “I think the challenge that we have is we remain some distance apart on what the Scottish Government and local government can afford and can put on the table from the union demand which is, of course, a 10% increase in pay. “If that had been accepted, if the 5% had been accepted, you would’ve actually seen teachers have a 21.8% cumulative rise since 2018. “So we’re trying very hard to have a fair and affordable package on the table but we do remain unfortunately some distance apart.” She added: “The pay demands we’re having from our trade union colleagues are simply unaffordable for the Scottish Government working on a fixed budget, already allocated, also eroded by inflation and that does make it a very difficult and challenging process to come to a conclusion and resolution on.” Earlier in the programme, Mike Corbett, NASUWT Scotland national official, echoed the concerns that unions and Government were still far away from agreement on pay. He said the last offer made in November was “dressed up as an improved offer” but did not improve pay for the “vast majority of teachers”. He added: “There’s still no formal revised offer on the table and that is the reason why our members and others feel they’ve got no alternative but to be out on strike again today and tomorrow.” Nicola Sturgeon also spoke to journalists about the strike on Tuesday. The First Minister said: “I deeply regret that we have industrial action in our schools. “I don’t think that’s in the interest of young people at all. “That said, I understand the strength of feeling of teachers and we highly value the teaching profession.” However, she said: “I can’t create additional funding that we don’t have and I’ve tried to be really honest with unions across the public sector. “We’re trying to be as fair as possible while maximising pay increases.”",Somerville: No stone will be left unturned in bid to resolve school strikes,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/scottish-government-teachers-education-secretary-scottish-parliament-conservative-b1052061.html

Gareth Davies, the auditor and comptroller general at the NAO, said keeping on top of conflicts of interest was a “crucial part of public stewardship” that was not always followed during the VIP fast lane process. He said the government had given detailed responses on how it would improve its processes after reports from the NAO and others highlighting a failure to adhere to basic standards of procurement when awarding some contracts during the pandemic. But the auditor general said the NAO was watching closely to make sure its recommendations on procurement and pandemic preparedness “do not get lost” as the government deals with other crises such as Ukraine and high energy prices. “We are always careful to recognise the exceptional circumstances but despite the intense pressure it is always necessary to cover basic areas of transparency,” Davies said. “Publishing what you’ve done within the normal timescales is still possible even in an emergency and the whole process around conflicts of interest. “You may well need a speeded up system for referring plausible suppliers of PPE into the system but you should absolutely insist that people should declare it if they have a private interest in that supplier, particularly if they are holding a position of authority or responsibility like a peer or an MP or a senior civil servant. That just couldn’t be demonstrated. “There were clearly people attempting to do that at different stages but there wasn’t a clear trail of how that had been handled. The reason was the sheer pressure of the emergency but you can see now where that leads you if you are not careful.” His comments come after the scandal over Mone, on a leave of absence as a Conservative peer, who is the subject of an inquiry over her alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro during the pandemic. She has vowed to clear her name. Davies gave his assessment after the NAO carried out 36 detailed reports on the £300bn of government’s spending during the Covid pandemic. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the NAO was looking carefully at resilience to help the UK become better financially prepared for events that may require big public spending, guarding against the “collective failure of imagination” to prepare adequately for a major pandemic. He said there would be better “stress testing” of emergency responses, and the NAO would look at preparedness across the board, asking: “How do you avoid being caught out by this?” “You could argue it has happened on more than just Covid. What’s happening on energy is pretty unprecedented and needs another emergency scheme developed at high speed from scratch. We don’t want to have to do that every time,” he said. Davies also warned about the effects of inflation on public sector budgets, especially major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and roads, as well as highlighting the risks that the NHS will not meet its targets on eliminating waits of longer than a year by 2025. Davies said the NAO has been pointing out the “headwinds that the NHS is facing in implementing the planned approach” to waiting lists as well as highlighting the “numbers that the plan was based on assumed the best case scenario … not a severe winter in cases of flu and … [without] the industrial action that is currently under way”. He said the NAO’s report from November highlighted “serious risks” in meeting the 2025 target on eliminating waits of longer than 12 months and its job was now to monitor progress and “help identify barriers to getting through the backlog faster”. “Clearly, a lot of those risks that we identified are still present,” he added. Rishi Sunak recommitted to the NHS waiting list targets last week as one of his major priorities. Davies said inflation was a major risk to the NHS budget as well as departments with exposure to construction costs such as “HS2 and the other rail and road improvement schemes”. Warning that the government has “difficult decisions” ahead on major infrastructure projects, he said it was possible to reduce the scope of some projects or make the case for more money but on others said: “You either do it or you don’t: you have a have binary choice there. So there are some very difficult decisions for government.” Davies said HS2 was a “good example where the legs that have currently been committed to are going to cost more than when the most recent decision to recommit to the schemes was taken, so that’s going to have to be taken into account in one way or another, either through additional funding or through looking at the future scope of the scheme”.","MPs and peers should declare links to firms they back for contracts, says NAO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/mps-and-peers-should-declare-links-to-firms-they-back-for-contracts-says-nao

With the economy set to enter recession, the nation’s productivity puzzle will be a key challenge for the Prime Minister and businesses to overcome in the year ahead. “Productivity has a huge impact on the economy and people’s standard of living. But growing NHS waiting lists, diminishing access to treatment and surging economic inactivity due to ill-health are all weighing on productivity in the UK. “Businesses that proactively implement effective incentivisation and employee benefits programmes throughout their entire workforce will be best placed to retain staff, drive better performance and grow in a post-Covid landscape.”UK bank NatWest has announced a new package of Cost of Living support measures, including £5.7m of funding for charities and partners.NatWest is giving £1m to the Trussell Trust, the food bank charity, to support the Help through Hardship scheme, plus over £1.6m to the debt advice sector; £900k for Responsible Finance to support provision of accessible credit to people; and a £1m partnership with Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) to provide cost of living support.NatWest is also giving struggling customers more time to repay debts, it says: From early February this year, where customers have missed several payments on an unsecured debt such as a loan or overdraft, the bank will extend the time for them to repay their debt from 18 to 24 months, giving them more time and flexibility. European financial markets are relatively upbeat after a good showing on Wall Street last night, ahead of the next US inflation numbers on Thursday, says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.“It helped that a speech by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell yesterday didn’t contain any shocks which would cause investors to worry about markets even more.

Régis Schultz, the chief executive of JD, said young shoppers had more cash in their pockets than a year ago thanks to the reopening of retail and hospitality which had provided jobs, while inflation had prompted people to go out and buy instead of waiting for bargains. He added that competition from online pure plays was waning as the costs of delivery racked up. “Investors are now saying to online players you have got to make money.

In the meantime, though, concerns about a recession and some doubts about how quickly Chinese demand will rebound when Covid infections are so high are putting a lid on any upside in oil.Investors are also relieved that Jerome Powell, the head of America’s Federal Reserve central bank, didn’t push back against expectations of a slowing in US interest rate rises when he spoke yesterday.The markets are also hoping for a drop in US inflation, when the latest consumer price index figures are released.Boyadjian points out that a drop in inflation could encourage the Fed to stop hiking interest rates as rapidly.Sentiment was boosted on Friday from signs that wage pressures in the United States are easing and that the services sector is headed for a sharp slowdown, but the hawkish rhetoric that later followed revived recession worries.

Heathrow says this is the highest passenger increase of any airport in Europe, “and possibly worldwide”.But it warns:We are concerned that the recovery of the aviation sector, which is critical to the economy, could be set back by the reintroduction of testing for travellers in the UK and elsewhere in response to increasing COVID levels in China, even though governments acknowledge there is no scientific basis for doing so.UK prime minister Rishi Sunak decided to introduce tests on arrivals from China at the end of December, after other countries including the US and Italy brought in similar measures.But scientists told the Observer that screening people coming from China would make little difference, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the UK was already very high, while airport checks had been shown to be unreliable in pinpointing disease carriers.Sunak’s U-turn on China Covid tests is a political move, say scientistsRead moreIf there is to be a correction in UK house prices, it will be driven by the homeowners whose fixed rate mortgage deals are set to expire over the next 12 months, says Zainab Atiyyah, analyst at Third Bridge.Mortgage and Bank of England interest rates started to increase during 2022 – and at least 1.4 millionUK households face the prospect of interest rate rises when they renew their fixed rate mortgages this year.➡️ https://t.co/HwWjla2Iwl pic.twitter.com/QKvIRIYbOU— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 9, 2023 But the UK’s “massive undersupply of new-build and second-hand houses.” will cushion that effect, Atiyyah points out.“Overall, our experts expect a slowdown in sales to continue in 2023 despite new stamp duty thresholds, as supply continues to dwindle.” “Those on Help to Buy deals will be crossing their fingers and hoping their deals don’t fall apart as new homes are delayed or not completed by the end of the year.

These claims, combined with further increases in motor inflation, have had a significant impact on our underwriting result for 2022.Direct Line says it expects around £90m of claims from the ‘freeze event’ in December. It has helped three thousand customers deal with burst pipes, water tanks and other related damage.Direct Line says:This, together with the freeze event from January 2022 and subsidence related claims over the summer means that we currently expect total weather claims to be in the region of £140 million for 2022, well above our 2022 expectation of £73 million.Direct Line’s motor insurance division also saw an increase in third party claims inflation during the fourth quarter of last year, and more claims in the quarter --partly due to adverse weather conditions.Shares in Direct Line have tumbled 28%, to 166p.JD Sports has also predicted its profits will be towards the top end of expectations, following a jump in sales over Christmas.JD Sports’ revenues grew by over 10% in the 22 weeks to 31 December 2022, accelerating to more than 20% in the six-weeks to 31 December 2022.It now expects pre-tax profits for the year to 28 January to be “towards the top end” of market expectations (£933m to £985m), although the final performance depends how the post-Christmas sales go.Shares in JD Sports have jumped 4.6% in early trading, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.Record sales of Champagne and prosecco have helped to push profits at Sainsbury’s to the upper end of forecasts.The supermarket chain has reported that profits this year are expected to be towards the upper end of its guidance range of £630m to £690m, although still below last year’s profits of £730m.J Sainsbury’s retail sales, excluding fuel, rose by 5.2% year-on-year in its third quarter (to 7th January). Grocery sales were 5.6% higher – and 12.5% ahead of pre-pandemic levels.And in the Christmas period, sales rose 7.1%, with grocery sales up 7.1%, general merchandise sales up 7.4% and clothing sales up 5.1%.That included a 22% jump in Taste the Difference Mince Pies, and a 49% rise in Taste the Difference Panettone, while there was “record sales for Champagne and prosecco”.But Simon Roberts, chief executive of J Sainsbury, flags that 2023 will be tough for households.“We understand money will be exceptionally tight this year particularly as many people wait for Christmas bills to land.

Rishi Sunak had previously refused to say whether he uses private healthcare, insisting it was ""not really relevant"". It followed a press report that Mr Sunak is registered with a private GP practice which charges £250 per consultation. At PMQs, Mr Sunak praised his local hospital ""for the fantastic care they have given my family"". ""That's why I'm passionately committed to protecting it with more funding, more doctors and nurses, and a clear plan to cut the waiting lists,"" he added. Mr Sunak had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that his healthcare was ""a personal choice"". ""As a general policy I wouldn't ever talk about me or my family's healthcare situation … it's not really relevant,"" he told the programme. Registering with an NHS GP does not exclude someone from using private healthcare. The prime minister's spokeswoman said Mr Sunak did not currently have private cover but declined to say when he registered with the NHS. ""In principle, he believes that the personal health details of individuals should remain private, but given the level of interest and in the interests of transparency he has set out that he is registered with a NHS GP,"" she said. A newspaper report in November suggested Mr Sunak was registered with a private GP practice that offers on-the-day appointments and home visits. Latest NHS figures show that in November last year, 58% of NHS patients were not seen on the day they made an appointment. At the same time, a record high of more than seven million people are waiting for hospital treatment. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in response to Mr Sunak's comments that the prime minister ""will find out what it's like to wait on hold at 08:00 as you call for an appointment"". Sir Keir's spokesman confirmed the Labour leader had never used private healthcare. He said he was ""not going to comment on individual health choices"" and Labour was focused on ""ensuring we have the best possible NHS"" for everyone in the country. Sir Keir also clashed with Mr Sunak over the government's plan for new legislation to enforce minimum service levels in the NHS and other key sectors. The Tories had gone ""from clapping nurses to sacking nurses"", Sir Keir said, adding that nurses and ambulance workers would not be on strike if the prime minister had negotiated. The prime minister said Sir Keir would not agree to minimum service levels in the NHS ""because he's on the side of his union paymasters, not patients"". Mr Sunak added that he wanted ""to have constructive dialogue with the unions"" and had accepted the recommendations of independent pay review bodies. Earlier, health unions announced they are pulling out of the NHS Pay Review Body process to determine pay for next year. The 14 unions - representing more than one million ambulance staff, nurses and other NHS workers in England - have called for direct negotiations with ministers about pay. Mr Sunak's comments followed Health Secretary Steve Barclay confirming he used an NHS doctor. Pressed on whether he has NHS care during an interview on LBC, Mr Barclay replied: ""Yes, I don't subscribe to private provision. ""But I don't have a problem with people, with their own money, who wish to spend that money on private healthcare. ""I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing for people to want to do."" Some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have made a point of drawing attention to their use of the NHS when they were prime minister. David Cameron often spoke about how the NHS cared for his disabled son, while Boris Johnson said the health service saved his life after he fell seriously ill with Covid. But when Mrs Thatcher was prime minister she was candid about her use of private health insurance, which she said was vital for her to ""go into hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want"".",PMQs: Rishi Sunak says he is registered with NHS doctor,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64237830?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Mr Kerr slammed the SNP for treating experienced workers as being easily replaceable after the report stated “the age profile of oil and gas workers means a significant proportion are expected to retire” during the First Minister’s acceleration of closing the industry. The energy strategy added it is positive that fewer young people were entering the sector, stating 12 per cent of the oil and gas workforce is under 30. This is despite warnings from the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board that more workers are required to meet future levels of labour demand. But the SNP’s aim of closing down the sector is at odds with what their Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, believes after he said last year that investment in North Sea oil and gas was vital for jobs in Aberdeen. Mr Kerr, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for net zero, energy and transport, said: “The SNP is threatening to destroy the lives of oil and gas workers with its uninformed intention of closing down the sector at its earliest point. “The assertion that the majority of these workers will be retiring is utterly reckless and a slap in the face to those who have dedicated years of service to such a valuable industry to our north-east economy. “This report implies it is a good thing fewer young people are entering the sector when all the evidence points to the very opposite as more people are needed to cope with labour demand. “The negative narrative of this is putting our younger generation off from having a long, productive career in an industry which supports countries worldwide. “Oil and gas is essential to securing our energy supply while also protecting tens of thousands of Scottish jobs. Yet this SNP energy strategy completely undermines the sector which will result in us relying on more expensive imports which do more damage to the environment. “This last week, many north-east residents watched in horror as a baleful, unnatural force threatened to hamper the livelihoods of North Sea workers. “After Nicola Sturgeon’s bid to toss more than 70,000 oil and gas jobs in the skip and wreck the energy transition, they should probably give it another week before trying to watch The Rig as well.” Do you want to respond to this article?

Some are habits of mind, some are industry propaganda. Sometimes, the situation has changed but the stories haven’t, and people follow the old versions, like outdated maps, into dead ends. We need to leave the age of fossil fuel behind, swiftly and decisively. But what drives our machines won’t change until we change what drives our ideas. The visionary organiser adrienne maree brown wrote not long ago that there is an element of science fiction in climate action: “We are shaping the future we long for and have not yet experienced. I believe that we are in an imagination battle.” In order to do what the climate crisis demands of us, we have to find stories of a livable future, stories of popular power, stories that motivate people to do what it takes to make the world we need. Perhaps we also need to become better critics and listeners, more careful about what we take in and who’s telling it, and what we believe and repeat, because stories can give power – or they can take it away. To change our relationship to the physical world – to end an era of profligate consumption by the few that has consequences for the many – means changing how we think about pretty much everything: wealth, power, joy, time, space, nature, value, what constitutes a good life, what matters, how change itself happens. As the climate journalist Mary Heglar writes, we are not short on innovation. “We’ve got loads of ideas for solar panels and microgrids. While we have all of these pieces, we don’t have a picture of how they come together to build a new world. For too long, the climate fight has been limited to scientists and policy experts. While we need their skills, we also need so much more. When I survey the field, it’s clear that what we desperately need is more artists.” What the climate crisis is, what we can do about it, and what kind of a world we can have is all about what stories we tell and whose stories are heard. Climate change was a story that fell on mostly indifferent ears when it was first discussed in the mainstream more than 30 years ago. Even a dozen years ago, it was supposed to be happening very slowly and in the distant future. There were a lot of references to “our grandchildren’s time”. It was a problem that was difficult to grasp – this dispersed, incremental, atmospheric, invisible, global problem with many causes and manifestations, whose solutions are also dispersed and manifold. That voices from the climate movement have finally succeeded in making the vast majority understand it, and many care passionately about it, might be the biggest single victory the movement will have. Because once you’ve won the popular imagination, you’ve changed the game and its possible outcomes. But this was a long, slow, arduous process, and misconceptions still abound. A lot of people don’t know that we’ve largely won the battle to make people aware and concerned. The LA Times ran a well-intentioned editorial last year about how most Americans don’t care about climate breakdown. That was true once, but no longer is. A Pew Research poll in 2020 concluded that two-thirds of Americans wanted to see more government action on climate, but last summer the scientific journal Nature published a study concluding that most Americans believe that only a minority (37-43%) support climate action, when in reality a large majority (66-80%) does. That gap between perceived and actual support undermines motivation and confidence. We need better stories – and sometimes better means more up to date. Outright climate denial – the old story that climate change isn’t real – has been rendered largely obsolete (outside social media) by climate-driven catastrophes around the globe and good work by climate activists and journalists. But other stories still stop us from seeing clearly. Greenwashing – the schemes created by fossil fuel corporations and others to portray themselves as on the environment’s side while they continue their profitable destruction – is rampant. It’s harder to recognise a false friend than an honest enemy, and their false solutions, delaying tactics and empty promises can be confusing for non-experts. Fortunately, as the climate movement has diversified, one new organisation, Clean Creatives, focuses specifically on pressuring advertising and PR agencies to stop doing the industry’s dirty work. Likewise, climate journalists are exposing how fossil fuel money is funding pseudo-environmental opposition to offshore wind turbines. (As the climate activist and oil policy analyst Antonia Juhasz recently told me, the climate movement is now going after every aspect of the fossil fuel industry, including funding by banks and, via the divestment movement, shares held by investors; donations to politicians; insurers; permits for extraction; transport; refinement; emissions, notably through lawsuits concerning their impact; shutting coal-fired power plants; and pushing for a rapid transition to electrification.) But we still lack stories that give context. For example, I see people excoriate the mining, principally for lithium and cobalt, that will be an inevitable part of building renewables – turbines, batteries, solar panels, electric machinery – apparently oblivious to the far vaster scale and impact of fossil fuel mining. If you’re concerned about mining on indigenous land, about local impacts or labour conditions, I give you the biggest mining operations ever undertaken: for oil, gas, and coal, and the hungry machines that must constantly consume them. Extracting material that will be burned up creates the incessant cycle of consumption on which the fossil fuel industry has grown fabulously rich. It creates climate chaos as well as destruction and contamination at every stage of the process. Globally, burning fossil fuels kills almost 9 million people annually, a death toll larger than any recent war. But that death toll is largely invisible for lack of compelling stories about it. All mining needs to be done with respect for the land and people in the vicinity, but the impact of mining for renewables needs to be weighed against the far more devastating impact of mining for and burning fossil fuel. The race is on to find battery materials that are more commonly available and less impactful than lithium and cobalt, and some of the results look promising. Last summer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced an aluminium-sulphur battery is in the works, while a US company is developing one that stores electricity using iron – the so-called “iron-air” battery. Efforts to extract battery materials from longterm coal waste in West Virginia are among the many others under way. And the Inflation Reduction Act includes funding to research better battery materials and domestic US sources. Other stories of premature defeat are all too common. In the 400,000-strong 2014 climate march in New York City, one section marched behind a huge banner declaring “WE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS” – but many people still believe we do not. We have the solutions we need in solar and wind; we just need to build them out and make the transition, fast. Looking to wildly ineffectual carbon sequestration and other undeveloped technologies as a relevant solution is like ignoring the lifeboats at hand in the hope that fancy new ones are coming when the ship is sinking and speed is of the essence. One story I frequently encounter frames the possibilities in absolutes: if we can’t win everything, then we lose everything. There are so many doom-soaked stories out there – about how civilisation, humanity, even life itself, are scheduled to die out. This apocalyptic thinking is due to another narrative failure: the inability to imagine a world different than the one we currently inhabit. People without much sense of history imagine the world as static. They assume that if the present order is failing, the system is collapsing, and there is no alternative. A historical imagination equips you to understand that change is ceaseless. You only have to look to the past to see such a world, dramatically different half a century ago, stunningly so a century ago. The UK, for example, ran almost entirely on coal power until the 1960s, and if you had said then that it would have to quit coal, many would have imagined this meant an utter collapse of the energy system, not its transformation. Even in 2008, the organisation Carbon Brief noted, “four-fifths of the UK’s electricity came from fossil fuels. Since then, the UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy. Coal-fired power has virtually disappeared and even gas use is down by a quarter. Instead, the country now gets more than half of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear.” Scotland already generates nearly all the electricity it needs from renewables. While I often hear people casually assert that our world is doomed, no reputable scientist makes such claims. Most are deeply worried, but far from hopeless. There are already profound losses, but our action or inaction determine how much more loss will occur, and whose it will be, and some repair is possible. Efforts sufficient to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lower temperatures and reverse some aspects of climate breakdown. Even the journalist David Wallace-Wells, who rose to fame with a deeply pessimistic book about climate a few years ago, has shifted his view. He currently describes a future somewhere between the best and worst case scenarios, a future “with the most terrifying predictions made improbable by decarbonisation and the most hopeful ones practically foreclosed by tragic delay. The window of possible climate futures is narrowing, and as a result, we are getting a clearer sense of what’s to come: a new world, full of disruption … yet mercifully short of true climate apocalypse.” A climate story we urgently need is one that exposes who is actually responsible for climate chaos. It’s been popular to say that we are all responsible, but Oxfam reports that over the past 25 years, the carbon impact of the top 1% of the wealthiest human beings was twice that of the bottom 50%, so responsibility for the impact and the capacity to make change is currently distributed very unevenly. By saying “we are all responsible”, we avoid the fact that the global majority of us don’t need to change much, but a minority needs to change a lot. This is also a reminder that the idea that we need to renounce our luxuries and live more simply doesn’t really apply to the majority of human beings outside what we could perhaps call the overdeveloped world. What is true of Beverly Hills is not true of the majority from Bangladesh to Bolivia. When it comes to who’s harming the climate, it’s also been popular to focus on individual contributions. The fossil fuel industry likes the narrative of personal responsibility as a way to keep us scrutinising ourselves and one another, rather than them. They’ve promoted the concept of climate footprints as a way to keep the focus on us and not them, and it’s worked. Usually if I ask people what they’re doing about the climate emergency, most will talk about what they’re not consuming or doing – but these will never add up to the speed and scale of change needed to change the system. One of the goals of system change is to supersede individual virtue. Just as you no longer have to opt in to buying a car with seatbelts or ask for the no-smoking section on the train or restaurant, at some point in the near future you won’t have to opt into travelling in an electric car or bus, or living or working in all-electric buildings. Electrification will have happened because of the collective action that takes shape as policy and regulation. Last year, the veteran environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a brilliant analysis pointing out that if you have money in one of the banks funding fossil fuels – especially, in the US, Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, and Bank of America – your retirement funds or savings account may have a much larger climate footprint than you do. The impact of your diet and how you get to work may pale in comparison to the impact of your money in the bank. The vegan on the bicycle may still be contributing to climate chaos if her life savings are in a bank lending her money to the fossil fuel industry. Individual impact, leaving the ultra-wealthy aside, matters mostly in the aggregate. And in aggregate we can change that. On 21 March, McKibben, via his new climate group Third Act (on whose advisory board I sit), and dozens of other climate groups will be organising actions by people with money in, or credit cards from, the key US banks, to try to force those institutions to stop funding fossil fuels. Our greatest power lies in our roles as citizens, not consumers, when we can band together to collectively change how our world works. Various campaigns around the world have focused on fossil finance, with significant successes behind them, and much more to achieve ahead. The climate movement has become far more sophisticated and precise in its targets in recent years. It’s doing a brilliant job; it just needs enough people and resources behind it to be more powerful than the status quo. Last year, I took three activists who were formerly part of the Sunrise Movement, a youth group campaigning to address climate breakdown, to see the 1991 film Terminator 2 at a cinema. The film was as great as I remembered, not least because the lead character, Linda Hamilton playing a ferocious young mother, chooses as her motto “no fate but what we make”. In that movie, the future has come back to meddle with the present through the sci-fi technologies of time travel and robot-warrior terminators. We see how actions in the present shape the future through tremendous battles over what that future will be. This is, of course, just as true in real life. We don’t get terminators and other time-travellers to tell us what the consequences of our actions are, but they still have consequences. You ban the insecticide DDT, and a lot of bird species stop dying out. You ban chlorofluorocarbons, and the hole in the ozone layer stops growing. In another way, Terminator 2 is less useful as a lens for thinking about the climate crisis. It’s part of the conventions of storytelling in film – and comics, fiction, graphic novels and too many news narratives – that tells us that the world can only be saved by exceptional individuals, often loners, whose gifts are often the capacity to inflict and endure extreme violence. Linda Hamilton and co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot, clobber, crush, outrun and outfight everything thrown at them, and that’s their celebrated skillset, along with a bit of dry humour. Humour aside, this has little to do with how the world really gets changed most of the time. The skills of real-world superheroes are solidarity, strategy, patience, persistence, vision and the ability to inspire hope in others. The rescuers we need are mostly not individuals, they are collectives – movements, coalitions, campaigns, civil society. Within those groups there may be someone with an exceptional gift for motivating others, but even the world’s greatest conductor needs an orchestra. One person cannot do much; a movement can topple a regime. We are sadly lacking stories in which collective actions or the patient determination of organisers is what changes the world. Another thing we get from our films and fictions is the expectation of a single solution and a clear resolution to our problems: a sudden victory, a celebration, and the trouble is over. The climate crisis does not fit easily into this format. Ceasing to extract and burn fossil fuel is central, but there is no single solution. Protecting carbon-sequestering peat bogs, forests and grasslands also matters; so does transforming high-impact materials such as cement; implementing better design for buildings, transport and cities, and addressing soil conservation, farming and food production and consumption. There are milestones and important goals, but the familiar Hollywood ending – crossing the finish line to wrap up the story – doesn’t describe this reality. Change often functions more like a relay race, with new protagonists picking up where the last left off. In 2019, a Berkeley city councilwoman decided to propose banning fossil-gas connections in new construction, and it was passed by the council unanimously. This small city’s commitment to all-electric new buildings could seem insignificant, but more than 50 other California municipalities picked it up, as did the city of New York. The state of New York failed to pass a similar measure, but Washington state succeeded, and the idea that new construction should not include gas has spread internationally. Such relay races have long been how human rights campaigns work: a good protest, campaign, or even piece of legislation can introduce new ideas that do their own work in the world at large. Even failed campaigns may succeed in opening the path for later change. The Green New Deal did not pass in the US Senate, but it became a template for the Biden administration’s climate legislation, and shifted the conversation about what is possible. It led the way to the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate bill the US has ever passed. Opponents of environmental action often say it is killing jobs; the Green New Deal did a lot to change that story by portraying climate action as a job creator. Recognising the reality of climate breakdown means recognising the interconnectedness of all things. That connection brings obligation: to respect nature, to build domestic regulation and international treaties that protect what’s needed, to limit the freedom of the individual in the name of the wellbeing of the collective. This is, of course, a worldview in direct contrast with free-market fundamentalism and libertarianism. Even the facts of climate science are ideologically offensive to people committed to individual freedom without accountability, let alone the demands created by treaties and regulations. Responsibility and obligation are dismal words in mainstream culture, so perhaps there will be other stories that recognise this process as reciprocity and relationship, in which we give back, in gratitude and respect for all the Earth does for us. Even short of that, we can recognise our self-interest in maintaining the system on which life depends. If news is the daily report on what’s just happened, we need a way of pulling back from individual events, to see the broad context of how it happened. If you only tell short-term stories, it all becomes kind of meaningless. Martin Luther King Jr said: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” We’ve seen it bend a lot of ways in recent years, toward and away from justice, but it takes time just to see it bend at all. You need benchmarks or memories of how things used to be even to see change of any kind, including climate change. The South Pacific climate activist and poet Julian Aguon recently declared that Indigenous peoples “have a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory, and just might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect – for the Earth and for each other”. That emphasis on collective memory suggests that a strong sense of the past allows for a strong sense of the future, that remembering difficulty and transformation equips us to face them again. One of the things that buoys me up is the long arc of change in renewable technology. Mostly what you see in the news about renewables is short-term: stories on the latest drop in price, or proliferation of solar and wind over the past year or two. If you enlarge your time frame, you see that those annual changes have amounted to an astonishing plummet in prices and rise in efficiency and global use, compounded by innovations in materials and storage. Twenty years ago we did not have constructive ways to leave the age of fossil fuel behind. Now we do. And the solutions keep getting better. In 2021, the organisation Carbon Tracker put out a report that showed current technology could produce 100 times as much electricity from solar and wind than current global demand. The report concludes: “The technical and economic barriers have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political.” At the end of the last millennium, those barriers seemed insurmountable. The change is revolutionary, but the revolution was too slow to be visible to most. The report continues: “At the current 15-20% growth rates of solar and wind, fossil fuels will be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050. The unlocking of energy reserves 100 times our current demand creates new possibilities for cheaper energy and more local jobs in a more equitable world, with far less environmental stress.” We tend to think utopias are unbelievable, but this is a sober-minded thinktank focused on climate and energy politics. The report made little impact on the general public. Because the energy revolution has been incremental, there’s been no single breakthrough moment. Yet it adds up to an encouraging, and even astonishing narrative. On the other hand, people find grim narratives all too believable, whether or not they are grounded in fact. We are still inundated by harmful, as well as untrue, stories about climate and the future. Prophecies can be self-fulfilling: if you insist that we cannot possibly win, you pit yourself against the possibility of victory and the people trying to achieve it. There’s yet another narrative that’s persisted at least since the invention of compact fluorescent lightbulbs and the Toyota Prius: that we must renounce abundance and enter an age of austerity. It’s all in the telling. To consider our age an age of abundance, you have to be counting sheer accumulated stuff and ignoring how it is distributed. That is, we live in an age of extreme wealth for some, and desperation for the many. But there’s another way to count wealth and abundance – as hope for the future, safety and public confidence, emotional wellbeing, love and friendship and strong social networks, meaningful work and purposeful lives, equality and justice and inclusion. Early on, we heard that renewables were very expensive – this was part of the austerity narrative, or an excuse for not making the transition. But improvements in design and economies of scale are among the factors making them the cheapest form of electricity almost everywhere on earth. There’s no reason to think the innovations of design and economic improvements are all behind us; I suspect they’re mostly ahead of us. Engineer and energy expert Saul Griffith recently wrote: “Most people believe a clean-energy future will require everyone to make do with less, but it actually means we can have better things.” The old story was that we couldn’t afford to do what the climate emergency required. The new one is that it would not only be ecologically devastating, but more expensive not to. Renewables are on the way to being cheaper than fossil fuel; in many places, they already are. Texas and Iowa get a huge amount of their electricity from wind because it makes economic sense, not because these red states are passionate about addressing the climate crisis. Over their lifetime, electric cars work out to be cheaper than internal combustion cars because charging and maintaining them is cheaper. And of course these two examples don’t include the indirect effects of burning fossil fuels on human health and the climate. A lot of people tend to measure climate action in terms of huge national or international news events, but the change that matters is often happening at local and regional and other levels. A university divests; a state sets a date for ending the sale of new petrol cars; a city passes a measure mandating all-electric new buildings; ground is broken on a major solar installation; a state or country sets a new record for percentage of wind power in its energy mix; a pipeline or gas terminal or drilling site gets cancelled; a carbon-sequestering forest or peat bog gets protected status; a coal plant closes. This does not erase all the bad news, about continuing breakdown of natural systems and its toll on human lives and impact on a livable future, but it does contextualise them as crises we can respond to if we choose to. So much is happening, both wonderful and terrible, and it adds up to more stories than almost anyone can take in. But the overarching frameworks in which we receive them matter, and so do the critical skills to recognise, choose, and change stories. The climate crisis is a problem with no single solution, but many, just as there is no one saviour, but many protagonists in the struggle. In 2019, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said we must embrace “cathedral thinking”, adding: “We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.” The speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler included this passage in one of her essays: “OK,” the young man challenged. “So what’s the answer?” “There isn’t one,” I told him. “No answer? You mean we’re just doomed?” He smiled as though he thought this might be a joke. “No,” I said. “I mean there’s no single answer that will solve all of our future problems. There’s no magic bullet. Instead there are thousands of answers – at least. You can be one of them if you choose to be.” This is an edited version of a speech given at Princeton University in November 2022","‘If you win the popular imagination, you change the game’: why we need new stories on climate",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/12/rebecca-solnit-climate-crisis-popular-imagination-why-we-need-new-stories

If its construction goes to plan, a €2.5 billion (£2.18 billion) undersea pipeline will convey “green hydrogen” from Spain to France from 2030. In the US, some power stations are being upgraded to allow hydrogen to be blended with fossil gas, and the Norwegian oil company Equinor is teaming up with Thermal SSE to build a 1,800 megawatt (MW) “blue hydrogen” power plant in Britain. Meanwhile, China unveiled a plan in March which includes deploying 50,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2025 and early December saw the first hydrogen-fuelled tractors and forklifts leave the assembly line at a new plant in Guangdong province. Hydrogen is produced in multiple ways. A colour spectrum is used to render it simple. “Grey” and “brown/black” hydrogen come from fossil gas (methane) and coal (brown or black coal) respectively – a process that, for every tonne of hydrogen, emits between ten and 12 tonnes of CO₂ for grey hydrogen and 18 to 20 for brown. “Blue” is the same process except the carbon dioxide is supposed to be captured and stored underground. And “green” hydrogen is conventionally defined as generated from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. But only 0.04% of hydrogen is green, and blue hydrogen is less than 1%. The rest is grey or brown, most of which is used in oil refineries and for manufacturing ammonia and methanol. It’s an enormous industry which emits more CO₂ than all of Britain and France combined. It is widely hoped that a silver lining of today’s high gas prices will be green hydrogen becoming a cost-competitive alternative to dirty fuels in boilers, shipping tankers and steelworks furnaces. Unfortunately, without electricity market reform, this opportunity is likely to be squandered. And while the buzz around the hydrogen economy intensifies, a closer look suggests the fuel is less a spearhead for a green transition and more the subject of an elaborate bait-and-switch operation by oil companies. Hydrogen’s true colours Green hydrogen is essential for decarbonisation: to replace fossil fuels in steelmaking, ammonia production for fertilisers and possibly shipping and trucking – processes which are difficult to electrify. Some green hydrogen is crosshatched with dirtier hues. So it’s not simply that in its production a lot of energy is wasted in the double transformation from electricity to gas and then fuel. But burning hydrogen also emits nitrogen oxides, air pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain. If green hydrogen production is scaled up to play a significant economic role by 2050, its freshwater demand will exceed one-quarter of today’s global annual consumption, risking water scarcity in some regions. Above all, hydrogen is meaningfully green only if the renewable energy that generates it cannot be fed into the grid to replace power from gas or coal plants. Blue hydrogen relies on a similar – but much more harmful – trick of the light. For hydrogen to be true blue, the emissions must be captured and securely stored. In theory, carbon capture and storage works but nearly all plants use the captured carbon to pump more oil and many have been shut down as failures. Only a handful store carbon indefinitely and even these consume lots of energy and capture only some of the CO₂, which can leak. Blue hydrogen’s main source is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is notorious for escaping drilling wells and pipelines. Research suggests that these issues make blue hydrogen worse for the climate than fossil gas. In the EU, as in many economies, electricity pricing is based on the principle of marginal costs, which means that the most expensive source (typically fossil gas) sets the wholesale power price. During sunny or windy spells, a glut of renewable energy generation can slash electricity prices, freeing them from the grip of natural gas prices for a few hours at a time. This is often not enough to justify investments in the electrolysers which produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen won’t gain the necessary price advantage over blue hydrogen and fossil gas until electricity markets are restructured. Meanwhile, the high price of oil and gas has turbocharged the industry’s expansion. The US government is exhorting oil and fracking firms to “drill baby drill”. Britain’s government is to award more than 100 licenses to drill for oil and gas and colossal new fossil fuel investments have been announced across the Middle East and Africa. In a few years when these new sources come onstream, and particularly if economic growth continues to slow and depress energy demand, gas and oil will become cheaper again – until the next price spike prompts new rounds of investment, and the infernal cycle continues. The owners of newly-built wells, pipelines and terminals will fight to defend those assets and stall decarbonisation. Now fossil-fuel firms are rebranding themselves as agents of “carbon management.” The aim is to prevent their assets from getting stranded by repurposing them, presenting a largely fictional substance, blue hydrogen, as a low-carbon “bridge” to an unspecified green future. Other sectors have joined the oil-led coalition. As the engineer Tom Baxter observes, gas network operators and boiler manufacturers see their survival in this ploy. Utilities are similarly keen, as hydrogen’s inefficiencies allow them to sell more power. Tackling this stalling operation requires public policy. Governments will need to regulate or tax carbon out of the market while simultaneously ramping up renewables. The approach to electricity pricing also needs to shift, to decouple the prices of electricity generated from renewables and fossil gas. The marginal pricing system hugely benefits renewable project owners, since they profit from high electricity prices and effectively zero input costs. An alternative market structure would set rewards for generators according to their average costs plus a slight surplus which could be reinvested into deploying more renewables and other green technologies, providing consumers with cheap electricity. This can only be achieved through a robustly regulated market or by nationalising energy companies and setting prices and production. These interventions would give green hydrogen a competitive advantage over blue or grey variants, one that could be furthered with other subsidies, such as tax credits on the model of the US Inflation Reduction Act. Above all, energy demand must be reduced to ease upward pressure on price. In any future energy system, hydrogen will have a role. But its expansion must be carefully designed, to prevent the promise of green hydrogen disguising the risks of its blue and grey cousins.

The company, which is part of Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, will begin consultations over 440 redundancies and said it will idle its plant at West Bromwich and convert another in Newport, Wales, into a storage facility. Jobs are also likely to be lost at its Rotherham plant after Liberty said it became “unviable” to produce cheaper steel products, “due to high energy costs and imports from countries without the same environmental standards”. The firm will now focus on steel for defence, energy and aircraft-making clients in a bid to regain profitability. Jeffrey Kabel, Chief Transformation Officer for Liberty Steel Group said: “While our action is expected to regrettably impact the roles of some of our workforce we will provide a level of guaranteed salary and placement opportunities.” He added: “We remain committed to our longer-term growth plans in the UK including our plan to grow Rotherham into a 2 million tonne green steel hub.” Cheap imports from China, where European producers say lax pollution regulations make the material cheaper to make, are squeezing margins on cheaper steel products such as the thick rebar staves used to reinforce concrete in the construction industry. But Britain is also at a disadvantage to European producers, according to UK Steel, the industry group. It estimates that German producers will pay £107 per megawatt hour of electricity in the coming financial year compared to £174 for UK steel mills. Electric furnaces are seen as the future of many UK steel mills as wind power becomes an increasing part of power supply. The steel sector employs 34,500 people directly in the UK and supports a further 43,000 in supply chains. The jobs are often in areas with few other skilled careers and they offer a salary averaging £37,629, 45pc higher than the UK national average. Alun Davies, Community steelworkers' union national officer, said: “This announcement is a body blow to Liberty Steel’s loyal UK workforce, who couldn’t have done more to get the company through an exceptionally challenging period.” Liberty Steel, the UK’s third-largest steel maker after Tata and British Steel, employs 1,900 people in the UK as well as 5,000 contractors. It said Rotherham could lose 185 jobs, while 121 were at risk in Newport, where the company makes thin plates of steel known as hot rolled coil. West Bromwich could lose 99 jobs, and 35 could be lost in Tredegar in South Wales. Both sites make steel tubes. Liberty was hit by the collapse of Greensill Capital from which it borrowed $5bn (£4.1bn). Mr Gupta’s businesses had borrowed from ventures founded by Australian entrepreneur Lex Greensill, which loaned money to companies short term. It collapsed after one of its insurers refused to renew cover. In November, Liberty reached an understanding with creditors to Lex Greensill’s former lending empire including Swiss bank Credit Suisse, in what it called a major step in refinancing the troubled businesses.",Liberty Steel to make over 400 staff redundant as energy costs hammer industry,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/12/liberty-steel-make-400-staff-redundant-energy-costs-hammer-industry/

Thursday saw several developments in Britain’s many industrial disputes as it emerged the ambulance union will meet next week to consider six more strike days. Staff at more than 150 universities across the country are demanding that employers push up their offer of a 3 per cent pay rise after more than a decade of below-inflation increases, the union said. “The clock is now ticking for the sector to produce a deal or be hit with widespread disruption throughout spring,” UCU general secretary Jo Grady said. Meanwhile, around 100,000 civil servants have also decided to go ahead with a walkout next month after failed talks with the government were dismissed as a “total farce”. Doctors’ unions told health secretary Steve Barclay that he must address the “workforce crisis” at a meeting on Thursday, during which there was no movement on pay demands, while a ballot of a teacher’s union failed to meet the threshold for strike action. Talks aimed at resolving the long-running rail dispute were also set to continue following meetings between unions and employers on Thursday. Further ambulance strikes loom as figures showed emergency response times had fallen to their worst on record, with more than one in 10 people left waiting for paramedics for more than three-and-a-half hours after calling, including with serious illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of damaging the NHS. Speaking in Belfast, he said: “The most important thing is that these strikes are ended. They will only be ended if the government gets in the room and negotiates and so instead of grandstanding, they need to govern.” Mr Barclay was given a “very clear message” that it would not be enough to focus on next year’s NHS settlement with doctors without a shift on current wages, union leaders said. Representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA), hospital doctors’ union the HCSA, and the British Dental Association (BDA) all met Mr Barclay on Thursday at what was described by both sides as a “constructive” meeting. A strike by 100,000 civil servants will go ahead next month after talks with the government aimed at resolving a bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions broke down. Cabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin met with union leaders to discuss growing industrial unrest after weeks of stoppages across the country, including by Border Force staff over Christmas. Unions had made it clear more money would have to be offered to head off an escalation of stoppages. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), said: “This meeting was a total farce. Despite being well-trailed by the government as a chance to resolve the crisis, it was nothing of the sort because the minister had nothing to offer. “He didn’t deny our members were being offered less than anyone else, he didn’t deny tens of thousands of our members only get a pay rise because of the rise in the national minimum wage but he refused to give us a pay rise now.” Nine out of 10 members of the Nasuwt teachers union in England and Wales voted for strikes over pay but the turnout was 42 per cent, falling short of the 50 per cent legal requirement. Nasuwt general secretary Patrick Roach said the union remains “in formal disputes with ministers and employers and will be continuing to take forward our campaigning for a Better Deal for Teachers. He said: “The readiness of our members to support industrial action demonstrates the anger of the profession and the need for governments in England and Wales to engage in meaningful negotiations to address the deep concerns of our members. “Our campaign to fight for the real-terms pay awards that teachers and headteachers deserve continues.” Leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) met separately with the Rail Delivery Group on Thursday. Both sides said detailed discussions were held and they were working towards a revised offer. Strikes have been held since last summer in the row over pay, jobs and conditions, causing huge disruption to services. No more strikes have been called. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said: “We have been in detailed discussions with the Rail Delivery Group for the train operating companies. We are working jointly towards a revised offer for their section of the dispute. “We’ve agreed that over the next couple of days we’ll continue to work on that through discussions, and we’ll see what comes of it.” Additional reporting by Press Association.",University staff to walk out for 18 days as ambulance workers consider further strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/strikes-ambulance-trains-nhs-teachers-b2261200.html

The James Hutton Institute has signed construction contracts with McLaughlin & Harvey worth £28.7m for the next stage of the ongoing redevelopment of its Invergowrie estate. This new contract comprises the construction of a combined Advanced Plant Growth Centre (APGC) and international barley hub (IBH). The new building – with the APGC downstairs and the IBH above – will be full of the latest state-of-the-art scientific equipment. This will include computing facilities, imaging technology, sensor-based systems, robotics and controlled environmental cabinets for growing plants. The project, funded by £62m from the Tay Cities Deal, is part of a masterplan to create two institute-led innovation centres at Invergowrie. It will help establish Scotland as a leader in global food security and crop resilience. Enabling works are ongoing on-site. A number of older buildings are being demolished to make way for the new facility. It will be built in the heart of the Invergowrie Campus and is due to be completed in early 2024. A ‘significant milestone’ for £62m project James Hutton Institute chief executive Colin Campbell hailed a “significant milestone” for the project. He added: “It aims to futureproof the barley sector across Scotland and the UK. “This new facility will serve as the key research hub. “It is set to bring around £60 million benefit and over 1,200 jobs to Scotland over the next 10 years.” UK Government Minister for Scotland Malcolm Offord said the facility will support “the future prosperity of our farming industry”. He also welcomed the creation of jobs in the region. Mr Offord said: “The UK Government is investing £45m at the James Hutton Institute through the Tay Cities Deal. “These new facilities will undertake vital research that will support food security and the future prosperity of our farming industry, while also creating new jobs for the region. McLaughlin & Harvey’s operations director Robbie Clark said the firm was delighted to be working on the project. He said: “Having recently completed the state-of-the-art Barley Field Centre facilities, our highly experienced project team will now move seamlessly on to the delivery of the new Advanced Plant Growth Centre and International Barley Hub.” Newly filed accounts for its commercial arm, James Hutton Limited, show it made pre-tax profits of over £600,000 for the year to March 2022.

At first, there is often outrage that the usual supremacy of bosses over workers has been suspended. Preserving such hierarchies is one of Conservatism’s main aims. But then there is sometimes a sense of opportunity: a belief that the strikers and their supporters may fall into a familiar trap, set by decades of anti-union legislation and press propaganda. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have believed that strikes can be used to make Tory governments look tough, and to discredit Labour and the wider left. The succession of aggressive, deliberately provocative anti-strike measures announced over the last six months by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak all reflect an assumption that taking on the unions is one of the few remaining strategies that might get the Conservatives re-elected. Yet there is also a third, almost forgotten Tory approach to strikes. Before the Thatcher government, her predecessor as Conservative premier, Edward Heath, faced with strikes that, like today’s, were highly disruptive and yet had considerable public support, was sometimes forced to negotiate and make concessions. As the leader of an unpopular government presiding over a fragile economy that the strikes were weakening further, Heath reluctantly accepted that the unions could not all be beaten. The briefly more constructive tone of some of this week’s talks between ministers and union leaders could be a sign that Sunak, too, will ultimately have to concede at least partial victories to some of the strikers. Like Heath, he is not a dominant or charismatic enough prime minister to change the national conversation about strikes and unions, as Thatcher did. His administration could finally mark the beginning of the end for the version of union-bashing Conservatism she invented, which seems increasingly irrelevant to today’s world of poverty wages and modest union memberships. Alternatively, the industrial relations of Sunak’s premiership could be much messier. Like the party he leads – for now, at least – the prime minister’s political thinking is an unstable, quite possibly unsustainable mix, including a desire to be pragmatic and “reasonable”, a dogmatic belief in markets as the best distributors of economic rewards, and an elite remoteness from ordinary working lives. His government’s attitude to the strikes is to be more conciliatory and more confrontational at the same time. Some strikers may be offered one-off bonuses and better pay rises; others, if they refuse to provide so-far-undefined “minimum service” in sectors from health to education may in future be sacked – despite being participants in walkouts that were democratically agreed and wholly legal when launched. For days now, the government has presented this minimum service legislation as an even-handed measure, to “restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption”. But claiming that a better “balance” between trade unionists and the public is required – rather than acknowledging that in millions of cases trade unionists and the public are the same people – has been a partisan Tory ploy for decades. British life has been tilted against unions since the 80s. And the Tories have never shown any interest in balancing the relationship between the public and other, more powerful and disruptive, but right-leaning, economic protagonists, such as the City of London. The disingenuous and vaguely worded minimum service bill also echoes recent draconian legislation aimed partly at road-blocking climate activists, “to balance the rights of protesters against the rights of others to go about their daily business”. Sunak may present himself as a centre-right technocrat, but partly out of panic at the mounting opposition to his government and Conservatism in general, he is increasingly ruling as an authoritarian. The government insists it supports the right to strike. The business secretary, Grant Shapps – often selected to try to make extreme policies sound moderate – said on the BBC’s Today programme earlier this week that the “ideal outcome” of the bill would be for the government “to have the power” to set minimum service levels “and never have to use it”, because unions would voluntarily set their own. But this scenario is less reassuring than it was meant to sound. If strikes in much of the economy are required to come with their own strike-breaking operations, of a size dictated directly or indirectly by the government, something fundamental to workplace politics has been altered. It’s possible that the bill may never become law, since it seems to contravene protections for unions in the European convention on human rights. And even if the legislation survives challenges in the courts, the Commons and the Lords, and on the streets (the TUC has announced a “national right to strike day” on 1 February) it may be hard to implement. Minimum service levels will have to be defined for a vast range of different workplaces, and then enforced without sacking too many essential staff or creating too many union martyrs. Yet to focus on such difficulties, enormous though they are, is to miss part of the point of this latest attack on strikers. Like many Tory policies since and including Brexit, the bill is meant to be symbolic and divisive as much as practical, to create bogeymen and energise Tory supporters. If inflation falls as expected between now and the election, and the strikers’ pay claims therefore seem less justified to many voters, then a continuing anti-union culture war might be timely. Without a Thatcher, fresh rightwing ideas or much remaining administrative energy, today’s Tories probably can’t run a reforming government that really hurts the left – but they can pretend. The problem with this impersonation of radicalism, though, is that it requires enough voters to be taken in. And Johnson’s drifting premiership, Truss’s shambolic tenure and now Sunak’s tone-deaf performance in 10 Downing Street have removed the Conservatives’ credibility as a governing party. Even the union-hating press hasn’t given the minimum service bill as much coverage as you might expect, which suggests uncertainty about its significance. Half a century ago, as well as negotiating with unions, Heath’s government also tried to weaken them through legislation. The 1970 industrial relations bill eventually became law despite huge protests. But it was widely flouted, and he lost the next election. If you’re a struggling Tory prime minister, victories on paper over the workers probably won’t save you.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded an increase of 0.1% as the services sector remained in growth despite the soaring cost of living. Experts at the ONS said the slight rise was supported by the technology sector and a strong showing by pubs and bars amid a boost from the winter World Cup in Qatar. It nevertheless represented a slowdown in growth after GDP increased by 0.5% in October. Analysts had predicted the economy would shrink by 0.3% for November. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy grew a little in November, with increases in telecommunications and computer programming helping to push the economy forward. “Pubs and bars also did well as people went out to watch World Cup games. “This was partially offset by further falls in some manufacturing industries, including the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, as well as falls in transport and postal, partially due to the impact of strikes. “Over the last three months, however, the economy still shrank – mainly due to the impact of the extra bank holiday for the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in September.” Consumer-facing industries were the biggest growth driver of the month, witnessing a 0.4% increase amid a lift from higher food and drink sales during the World Cup. The service sector also grew by 0.2% as more punters visited pubs and other venues, although this still reflected a slowdown from a 0.7% rise a month earlier. In November, the construction sector saw growth fall away as it stayed flat for the month following a 0.4% rise in October. Elsewhere, manufacturing was the main cause of a 0.2% decline in the production sector for the period. The ONS added that GDP still contracted by 0.3% over the three months to November despite the latest growth. The economy also declined by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2022 and would therefore enter a technical recession if a further fall is recorded for the final quarter of the year. Economists have suggested that the latest data makes it less clear whether the UK will have entered a recession at the end of last year. Kitty Usher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “This is stronger activity than was expected for November and so will further contribute to the improvement in market sentiment we have seen in the last few weeks. “Given we know the economy also grew in October – albeit driven by a rebound from the period of state mourning – it is no longer certain that the economy will meet the technical definition of a recession when the final data for 2022 is in.” It comes as inflation started to cool down in November, dropping to 10.7% from a 41-year-high of 11.1% a month earlier, and it is expected to drop further through 2023. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said: “We have a clear plan to halve inflation this year – an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world. “To support families through this tough patch, we will provide an average of £3,500 support for every household over this year and next – but the most important help we can give is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year so we get the economy growing again.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow Chancellor, said: “Today’s results are just another page in the book of failure that is the Tory record on growth. “The news of further economic pain will be deeply concerning to families already struggling with the soaring cost of living.”",UK economy unexpectedly grows in November,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/gdp-jeremy-hunt-rachel-reeves-institute-of-directors-b2261459.html

They want senior managers at tech firms to face two years in jail if they breach new duties over acceptable content, which includes posts promoting self-harm, depicting sexual violence or facilitating suicide. Labour is expected to support the amendment. Currently the proposed laws would only make bosses criminally liable for failing to give information to media regulator Ofcom and firms would face higher fines. Culture secretary Michelle Donelan has said she is “not ruling out” changes to legislation in the face of the major backbench rebellion. Dame Andrea said in its current form the bill is just asking companies “nicely” to protect children online. She told BBC Radio 4: “There should be this backstop that if you, as a senior tech director, or manager, knowingly allow harm to be caused that results in suicide, pornography, child abuse online and so on. “If you let that happen, there should be a backstop that you can be criminally prosecuted.” Dame Andrea added that in many other businesses, including in the financial and construction sectors, directors will face prosecution if their practices cause significant harm to someone. She said: “Yet here we have in this wild west of online, the most incredible harm every single day of the week being committed to young children and yet we stand by and we just ask nicely, and then we punish you if you refuse to cooperate.

The winning bids were revealed in a joint announcement by the UK and Scottish governments. The special economic zones north of the border are being created under a scheme agreed by the two governments. The successful applicants will be able to offer tax incentives and lower tariffs in the zones. A total of five bids for green freeport status were submitted, with North East Scotland, Orkney and Clyde missing out. Each had to set out how they would regenerate their area, create high-quality jobs and support transition to a net-zero economy. The Forth Green Freeport bid was led by Forth Ports, which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland. In submitting its bid, Forth Ports said it had the potential to create up to 50,000 new, high-quality jobs in renewable energy, manufacturing, sustainable fuels and construction. Its activities will focus on renewables, advanced manufacturing, alternative fuels, carbon capture utilisation and storage, shipbuilding, logistics and the creative industries. The Opportunity Cromarty Firth consortium - backed by Port of Cromarty Firth, Global Energy Group, Highland Resources and Port of Inverness - said it could create 25,000 jobs. The Inverness and Cromarty Firth bid aims to build a ""world-beating"" floating offshore wind manufacturing sector, with sites in the Cromarty Firth, Invergordon, Nigg and Inverness. Also called free trade zones, freeports are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in a zone receive tax waivers or tax breaks on National Insurance contributions, Land and Buildings Transactions Tax, business rates and capital allowances. The Scottish ""green freeport"" model includes commitments to meeting net zero targets and supporting fair work practices. The UK government has committed funding of £52m to the project and bidders had to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. Scotland's deputy first minister, John Swinney, described the creation of green freeports as a ""milestone achievement"". He said: ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport and Forth Green Freeport will support businesses to create high-quality, well-paid new jobs, promote growth and regeneration, and make a significant contribution to achieving our net zero ambitions. ""The successful applicants showed a strong determination to embed fair work practices, including payment of the Real Living Wage, and to enshrine net zero initiatives in their work. ""We look forward to working closely with them to ensure they deliver maximum positive impact and become operational as soon as possible."" The UK government's Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the green freeports would ""undoubtedly be transformative for future generations"". He added: ""Scotland has areas of outstanding opportunity but there are also places that can benefit from more investment to truly level up communities that have been overlooked. ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Firth of Forth are fantastic areas for these new green freeports to set up, ensuring the benefits are felt right across Scotland. ""This will help to create exciting new jobs, boost business and encourage investment in the local areas and beyond."" Scottish Renewables said it was pleased that the freeports would have green energy as a focus. Its head of energy transition and supply chain, Emma Harrick, said they would ""help Scotland compete on the international stage as offshore wind develops to become the mainstay of electricity generation in the UK"". The Scottish and UK governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border, after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later said they would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. The SNP's partners in government - the Scottish Greens - do not support the freeports, arguing they are likely to result in ""greenwashing"" rather than genuine action on sustainability. Greens MSP Ross Greer described freeports as a ""Thatcherite gimmick"" and voiced concern about potential abuse by criminals. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""We've consistently across the world seen freeports attract a lot of criminal activity, particularly money laundering and smuggling, because of the customs arrangements that are in place for them, because they are about deregulation, they are about making it 'easier', particularly for international trade."" Paul Swinney, director of policy research for think tank Centre for Cities, said it remained to be seen how much impact the new freeports would have. He said: ""With freeports, the government has dressed it up as saying we are going to make them into centres of innovation and hotbeds of new ideas. ""But the reality is that the tools that are that on offer make these schemes very attractive to low-skilled businesses rather than high-skilled businesses.""",Cromarty Firth and Forth to host first green freeports,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64248082?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Among the communities and organisations benefitting from funding awards in 2022 were Belhelvie Community Council, the East Grampian Coastal Partnership and Newburgh’s Udny Arms Hotel development for the construction of two retail ""pods"" which will be available for rent to local businesses. Mr Thomson said: “I’m delighted to see a number of community groups and organisations benefit from funds which now rightly flow into coastal communities following the Scottish Government gaining control of the Crown Estate Scotland’s revenues. “I would encourage coastal communities and organisations with a link to the coast to consider how they could make use of the sums available.” Grants are being targeted at community groups, third sector organisations and small businesses on Aberdeenshire’s coastline, and can fund a range of activities with positive economic, social or environmental impacts. This year’s grants will be targeted towards activities or infrastructure which meet the following priorities: Supporting the development of active travel routes along, to and from the coastline. Developing the coastal economy and sustainable tourism. Creating or enhancing community, leisure and recreational facilities. Safeguarding, restoring or enhancing the coastal environment. Grants between £10,000 and £50,000 will be available, while applicants must make a minimum 10 per cent match funding contribution to projects. Small business applicants must contribute 50 per cent match funding. Due to budget conditions, all projects must be completed within the 2023-24 financial year.

The Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) bid is a collaboration of more than a dozen organisations representing industry, academia and the public sector around the Easter Ross and Inverness area. The aim is to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity in manufacturing, and from local and inward investment, innovation, skills development and employment. READ MORE: Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport officially confirmed by Scottish and UK Governments The OCF area has been highlighted as the main location for the UK to benefit from floating wind manufacturing. Reacting to the news, HIE’s chief executive Stuart Black, said: “We congratulate Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) on their successful bid. This is fantastic news. “Our collective belief in the region and the key ports’ capacity and capability to play an essential role in offshore wind and green hydrogen delivery has been confirmed by the dedication, commitment and resolve shown by the bid partners. ""This paves the way for even greater industry collaboration. The consortium’s physical assets, natural resources, experienced supply chain, and can-do people have proven to be a winning combination that can lead to future success. “The Highlands and Islands will play a critical role in meeting the challenging net zero targets at both Scotland and UK levels. Green freeport status for the Cromarty Firth will be a huge asset, driving collaboration between industry, academia and the public sector to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity, investment, innovation and skills development. “It will attract large-scale manufacturing and create thousands of green jobs that complement the skills of the local workforce and accelerate Scotland’s and the UK’s progress to achieving net zero targets. “A green freeport will also build on recent significant investments made in ports and harbours across the region and the historic and ongoing strengths here in energy, engineering and life sciences. “It will be a key enabler for supply chains of the future, rapidly accelerating domestic manufacturing capacity in an area with a long-standing industrial heritage. “We very much look forward to our region working in partnership with OCF, as we seek to secure maximum socio-economic impact, not just around the Cromarty Firth and Inverness but throughout many parts of the Highlands and Islands.” Sheelagh Cooley, real estate partner in the Edinburgh office of law firm Shoosmiths, also welcomed the successful bid. She said: “The confirmation of two green freeports in Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Forth represents an opportunity to drive forward new development, regeneration and economic growth in Scotland. “The potential impact of these projects, however, must not be limited to the immediate vicinity of the green freeports. Rather, true success hinges on the ability to also revitalise surrounding towns and cities, many of which are economically deprived. “In Inverness and Cromarty Firth, the introduction of a green freeport is said to have the potential to unlock £2.5bn of new private sector investment – creating up to 25,000 jobs. This is alongside developing wind power technology, with its port facilities already supporting offshore wind projects. “While the introduction of green freeports is governed by UK legislation, the model’s legislative structure is subject to devolved and reserved powers. The sites are intended to be secure custom zones where business can be carried out inside a land border, but where different custom and tax rules apply - offering various regulatory and financial incentives. “From a planning perspective, the green freeports are likely to operate under extended permitted development rights. Combined with a streamlining of the consenting process for development, this type of relaxed planning regime could, in theory, allow schemes – residential, commercial and infrastructure - to be brought forward at speed and avoiding certain barriers. “Unlike the UK government’s freeport model, and investment zone proposals, Scottish green freeports are subject to additional requirements, including on carbon neutrality and paying the real Living Wage. “The Forth green freeport could act as a catalyst for the manufacture of offshore wind turbines, shipbuilding and energy systems. It encompasses several ports, industrial and logistics sites, as well as Edinburgh Airport, with the consortium behind the bid outlining that it could lead to a boom in job creation and economic growth that is rooted in renewable energy and decarbonisation. “The successful bidders will now work with the Scottish and UK Government to determine a governance structure for each site. A process that must balance deregulation and economic growth with protecting the environment and assisting the transition to net zero. “Subject to compliance with the regulatory controls, green freeports should provide a welcome opportunity for growth in the Scottish economy, especially in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.” Dr Liz Cameron CBE, Chief Executive, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, also welcomed the award. She said: “It is great news for Scottish business that the UK and Scottish Governments have finally confirmed the sites of the two winning bids. It’s important now that both governments act swiftly to ensure that the successful sites are operational at the earliest opportunity, we are all competing to attract investment and trade. “Whilst it will be very disappointing for those areas who were not successful, we would urge both governments to now consider, in partnership with the business community, other incentives and initiatives which could be developed from the innovation demonstrated by the other bidders.” Professor Chris O’Neil, principal and chief executive of UHI Inverness, said: “The awarding of Green Freeport status to Inverness and Cromarty Firth will have a transformative impact on the economic fortunes of the community we serve. ""We are poised, together with our UHI partners, to meet the subsequent skills and knowledge demand. “We have the expertise in engineering, research, technology, design and construction to provide a highly-skilled and aspirational workforce, including trainees, apprentices, graduates and researchers. “As well as being well-placed to meet the associated need for talent, we also have the established industry links and capacity for knowledge exchange to make valuable collaborative contributions to the creation of a global green hub. “Our talented and committed students have proved their resilience by studying while coping with the consequences of a pandemic and then a cost-of-living crisis, and this announcement is significant in that it represents an improved future and enhanced opportunities for many of them. “Current and upcoming students will complete their learning journey knowing there is the potential for attractive employment on our doorstep in an expanding industry. These prospects will help retain local talent and will also appeal to a generation of students who are environmentally conscious and willing to embrace a sector that supports their values.” Do you want to respond to this article?

Josh Self,87322068,https://www.politics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PA-68183790.jpg,en,2023-01-13 16:13:37,-0.024,GB,"Rishi Sunak is a hyper-aware, even self-conscious prime minister. Since taking post in October, he has worked assiduously to present a “slick” image to the media, undertaken multiple U-turns to halt backbench rebellions and tried at every turn to position himself positively against Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer. The tricky technocrat in No 10 is obsessed with good press. It is an approach that bares stark contrast to the days of Liz Truss, who showed little concern for how her policies might be received amid her deeply misguided ideological crusade. Unlike his predecessor, therefore, you can take for granted that when Sunak announces a new policy, there will be a hefty amount of calculated politicking involved. In this way, November’s Autumn Statement was strategically orientated to exploit traditional Conservative strengths and traditional Labour weaknesses. Sir Keir, ever-keen to present Labour as a responsible party after the Cobrynite experiment, was challenged to disagree with Sunak’s proposals. In the end, Labour’s inability to sign up wholeheartedly to the new fiscal orthodoxy exposed, in chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s analysis, a deficit of common sense in Labour ranks. When it comes to the government’s new anti-strike bill, the political thinking is essentially the same. Setting a trap… The new anti-strike legislation was introduced to the House on Tuesday by business secretary Grant Shapps. Citing risks posed to NHS patients, Shapps outlined that the new bill would require public sector services to run minimum levels of provision on strike days — essentially forcing a certain proportion of an industry to work or face the sack. The move harks back to a “golden age” of Conservative power over industrial relations. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have viewed strikes as a way to make their party look tough and discredit the Labour Party alongside the wider left. To be sure, we have already seen Starmer encounter some political difficulty in this latest wave of industrial action. In the summer, he chose to sack one-time frontbencher Sam Tarry for standing alongside picketing workers. For the Labour leader — intent on distancing his party from the unions — Tarry had crossed a very literal red line. But even if Starmer wants to downplay the connection, there is no escaping the fact that the Labour party is associated politically and financially with the trade union movement. With the new anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak hopes to implicate Labour in an upsurge of union militancy, thus slowing Starmer’s inexorable march towards Downing Street. It was telling that ministers chose to announce the new strike legislation within hours of the Labour leader’s “New year, New Vision” speech last week. Shapps’ pledge stole Starmer’s limelight and Labour’s newly announced “take back control bill” secured a grand total of zero newspaper front pages the following day. The politics of the new legislation also dominated Starmer’s post-speech press conference. Under a barrage of questioning, the Labour leader confirmed that his party will vote against the plans and repeal the Act if he takes power at the next election. It was all going to plan for Sunak. He had goaded Starmer out of hiding and forced the Labour leader to share an ideological platform with that favourite Conservative bogeyman: the so-called union “baron”. The PMQs’ attack lines wrote themselves. However, few would deny that the prime minister is playing a high-stakes political game with his new anti-strike bill. Although Starmer’s reaction could be accounted for, the government risks running into a hostile public backlash. Now a week on from when the legislation was announced, and many view the new proposals as needlessly and deliberately obstructive. Risk 1: The government is viewed as needlessly obstructive Although Conservative MPs imagine Mick Lynch as the new Arthur Scargill, the infamous union “baron” who led opposition to Margaret Thatcher, the general public is not so convinced. Instead, the political posturing around the new anti-strike bill may be viewed as deepening the industrial relations crisis and prolonging our winter of discontent. Furthermore, the new bills’ parliamentary progress is set to be slow, with a difficult House of Lords stage beckoning. And when/if the bill does eventually pass, its key provisions will unquestionably be tested in the courts before they can take effect, just as is the case with deportations to Rwanda. So with the proposed legislation unlikely to do anything to solve urgent disputes, the public may well wonder want the point is at all — if not to be deliberately coercive and punitive. Risk 2: Labour exploits support for striking nurses Another risk for Sunak is that by focussing on risks posed to NHS patients during the strikes, he ventures onto territory where the Labour Party is traditionally at its strongest. It is telling that Starmer has focused his attacks on the part of the bill which would allow employers to sack workers who defy a “work notice” by striking. At PMQs on Wednesday, Starmer accused the government of going from “clapping the nurses to sacking the nurses”. On Thursday came a new widely-shared graphic by order of Labour Party HQ, which accused Sunak of planning to give striking nurses “the finger”, Alan Sugar-style. This attack line works because it is not very far from the truth. As a result of the proposed law, individual nurses could be prosecuted and even jailed. These are the same people Sunak was pictured clapping for, as chancellor, throughout the pandemic. Risk 3: Sunak is viewed as a rigid, uncompromising ideologue Sunak’s desire to be seen as pragmatic and “reasonable” may be fundamentally undermined by the passage of this bill. In pursuing the new legislation, Sunak has abandoned his “managerialism” and political prudence, territory where the risk-averse Starmer is comfortable, in order to set up a battle over principles, territory where Starmer is not. Honing in on fundamental Labour-Conservative differences in a bid to exploiting the Labour leader’s risk-averse nature, Sunak hence risks exposing the worst aspects of Conservative ideology. While the prime minister may point to a more conciliatory tone in negotiations, there is no hiding that the new law is an act of explicitly Thatcherite homage. It is as provocative and divisive as much as practically possible, drawing on Conservatism’s collective memory of disputes in the 1980s. However, you cannot help but think that in picking a fight with NHS nurses, Sunak has chosen the wrong moment to abandon his “problem-solving” priorities and get dug in with Conservative dogma. One recent YouGov poll found that 64% of the public support the striking nurses. Rather than introducing anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak’s political future may be better served by getting around the negotiating table and constructively ending the industrial dispute once and for all. So with imagery of nurses in handcuffs circling — and with ordinary Britons desperate for some degree of normalcy to return, Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes looks destined to fail.",Week-in-Review: Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes is destined to fail,https://www.politics.co.uk/week-in-review/2023/01/13/week-in-review-sunaks-attempt-to-trap-starmer-on-strikes-is-destined-to-fail/

As energy experts focused on how data can be used in the transition to a low-carbon economy, we have closely followed how this volatility has played out in Britain. Full data for the year 2022 is now available and here are a few things we have noticed. Britain (we talk about Britain and not the UK, as Northern Ireland is part of an integrated Irish electricity grid) saw a 4% drop in electricity demand from 2021 – that’s the third largest year-on-year reduction after 2008 (caused by the shock of the global financial crash) and pandemic-affected 2020. It takes Britain’s overall electricity demand back to values last seen in the 1980s, an 18% reduction from its peak in 2005. This time two years ago, we stated that COVID lockdowns meant electricity demand would never be so low again. We got it wrong. In fact, 2022 was the lowest year by some margin (2% lower than 2020). We believe the main factors for this drop were the significant increase in prices, the wider media attention on this, and the wider cost of living crisis. From importer to exporter The earliest undersea high-voltage direct current cable (known as an interconnector) from Britain to another country’s power grid was laid in 1961 across the Strait of Dover to France. In the years since, another seven have been constructed: two to Ireland, one to Belgium, one to the Netherlands, one to Norway and a further two to France. More interconnectors are under construction or proposed, including a connection with Denmark due to go live at the end of 2023. Since 1978, Britain has always used these cables to import more electricity than it exported over a given year. Over the past decade, an average of 5% of the country’s electricity has been imported, helping to reduce the amount it needed to generate itself. However, net imports swung to net exports in 2022 for the first time in 44 years. Looking at the individual interconnectors, it was the link to France that caused this significant change. In 2021, there were 14 terawatt-hours (TWh) of net imports from France whereas in 2022, there were 10 TWh to France. This is an enormous swing of 24 TWh from a single point of connection, and represents the largest annual change in a single electricity source since the shift from coal to gas in 2015/16. To put 24 TWh in context, this is broadly similar to the amount of electricity Scotland uses each year, or the annual output from Britain’s onshore wind generation. So what happened? Over the past year, French nuclear power stations had many maintenance problems which led to significant reductions in their output. In August, 57% of the country’s generation capacity was not being used. Despite a modest recovery, as of January 2023, 15 of its 56 reactors were closed for repairs. All this meant nuclear-reliant France had to import electricity from neighbouring countries. This led to more electricity being generated in Britain than would otherwise have been the case, to satisfy the additional demand from France. So while Britain’s renewable generation was at a record level, its fossil fuel generation was also higher than in the previous year. Without the problems in France, 2022 could have been the first year that Britain’s wind, solar and hydro combined generated more electricity than its fossil fuels – a milestone that will happen anyway over the next couple of years. Wind is cheap, but your electricity isn’t Wind generation also recovered from its relatively poor output in 2021 to reach a record generation of 77 TWh. That’s a 24% increase on the preceding year, when capacity increased by just 11%. This sudden increase highlights the year-to-year variations that need to be planned for to have a robust and resilient decarbonised power system, including longer duration energy storage. Renewables (including generation from biomass) contributed nearly 40% of Britain’s total generation in 2022. This progress, along with the lower demand for electricity within Britain, meant emissions from the power sector were broadly similar to previous years (though would have been lower if imports from France had continued). The rising prices of electricity and gas have contributed to a cost of living crisis, putting millions in fuel poverty. And though renewables and nuclear together provided over half of Britain’s electricity in 2022, the system is still overwhelmingly influenced by prices set by fossil fuel plants. Reforms are urgently needed here to decouple the price of low-carbon electricity from that of fossil fuels.",Britain is a net electricity exporter for first time in 44 years,https://theconversation.com/britain-is-a-net-electricity-exporter-for-first-time-in-44-years-197506

The Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the BBC's Today programme and the rest of the doomsters may be convinced that we face some terrible economic apocalypse. But the facts refuse to oblige. Confounding all expectations, output in Britain grew by 0.1pc in November, leading financial analyst across the City to upgrade forecasts. That means we're not in a recession after all. And it could get even better when we see the official December data. In spite of all the doom and gloom about a disastrous seasonal shopping season British consumers did what they do best and opened their wallets. The result? Retail sales soared — right in the midst of the 'cost of living crisis'. Growth in November was driven by the UK's resilient services sector — everything from haircuts and shopping malls to the banks and legal services of the City, as well as entertainment and communications. It accounts for nearly 79 per cent of our national output. (Construction was flat, hindered by rising interest rates, while manufacturing dipped.) So in spite of months of bad news from Downing Street in the form of tax hikes and budget cuts — as well as a seemingly never-ending stream of headlines about soaring energy bills, rampant inflation and relentless strike actions — Christmas 2022 brought excellent economic news. From the high street to the retail park, sales were brisk. Shopping boomed across the country, with almost every category in the sector — be it supermarket groceries, beauty products at Boots, or Nike Air Force trainers — keeping the tills rattling throughout the festive period. Marks & Spencer, far from being the busted flush of popular imagination, saw turkeys and sparkling wine help to deliver a 6.3 per cent gain in sales through its food halls. Mid-market Sainsbury's, thought to be a victim of competition from German value retailers Aldi and Lidl, also defied the odds with a 7.1 per cent rise in sales over Christmas. High street giants Tesco, Next and Lidl have all done impressively, too. as have local favourites Greggs and Boots. Corks were also popping at the UK's biggest wine retailer Majestic, where price cuts brought shoppers through the doors in droves. Stunningly, sales were 21.1 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. JD Sports, meanwhile, recorded a 20 per cent lift in sales over the holiday period, driven by 2.6 million pairs of Nike trainers. But it's not just shops. In aviation, passenger numbers at Heathrow were up 90 per cent on the 2021 festive period — when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 blighted festive getaways — defying industrial action by border staff. Elsewhere, in spite of this week's aborted Virgin Orbit launch in Cornwall, the UK's space sector is booming, with Germany's Rocket Factory Augsburg signing a multi-year partnership for a planned launch on the Shetland Islands. The industry generates £16.5 billion of income. And, in another boost, this week's news of a gas find in the southern North Sea by a Shell-led consortium has been hailed as 'fantastic'. The good tidings continue. The Office for National Statistics reported this week that, in 2021, UK output per hour worked 'had the fastest growth of the G7 countries'. Not something likely to lead BBC headlines. Banking giant JP Morgan Chase says that about three-quarters of its mid-size UK business leaders (the backbone of our economy) plan to grow their enterprises this year — and have no plans to shed jobs. So, when all this is accounted for, and despite all the dire talk from the Bank of England and others about the longest recession in our history, things could be turning out far better than expected. And saying this matters. Because drumbeats of bad economic forecasts can fast become self-perpetuating, ramping up the gloom and helping to delay our recovery. Even Doomster-in-Chief — Chancellor Jeremy Hunt — now believes that the economic slow-down will be milder than forecast. So why isn't he — and, indeed, our glum Prime Minister — leading by example and shouting the positive news from the rooftops? After all, it is the Conservative Party's 'energy price guarantee' on people's bills (established under the Liz Truss debacle and largely embraced by Sunak and Hunt), along with targeted help for the poorest families unveiled by Sunak when he was still at the Treasury, that together have taken the sting out of household gas and electricity costs. And that's in addition to the recent sharp fall in the price of wholesale gas, as a result of the extraordinarily mild European winter — one of the warmest in half a century. This has reduced demand and lowered tariffs, further helping to cut the cost of living. Yet despite these successes, Nos 10 and 11 have echoed the pessimistic economists who were still insisting at the end of last year that consumers as well as retailers were bound to suffer badly this winter. The British Retail Consortium's Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said in early December that 'the cost of living crisis means many families might dial back their festive plans'. She could not have been more wrong. It's clear then that, while cost pressures are real, people have not stopped spending. How is this possible? Amid the purported misery, it seems families are still determined to enjoy themselves. My view is that the soothsayers have underestimated two post-pandemic factors. That big savings balances approaching £200 billion, built-up during the pandemic, have been sitting around ready to be spent. And that, ahead of the holidays, fewer credit cards had been swiped to their limits than in previous years. The British Retail Consortium continues to warn that because of further rises in the cost of living, retailers face headwinds in 2023. Maybe so. But inflation is forecast to fall dramatically, wholesale gas prices have tumbled and the employment market remains strong, with more than 1 million vacancies. The pessimism is being overdone.

Here, we look at all the exhibitions locals and visitors alike will be able to see at the popular Schoolhill venue. These include exhibitions which opened in 2022 but will remain in the gallery for some part of 2023. Pavlovka Pinhole Photography Festival (until February 12) The Pavlovka Pinhole Festival was established in 2017 in Kyiv, Ukraine, to celebrate the playfulness, surprise and magic of pinhole photography. Organised by curator Yuliia Belska, the festival aims to unite international photo artists who use the world’s oldest photographic tradition in their work. Jerwood Art Fund Makers Open (until March 5) A collaboration between Jerwood Arts and Art Fund in partnership with Aberdeen Art Gallery, the exhibition celebrates work by early-career artists and makers Anna Berry, Cecilia Charlton, Jahday Ford, Vicky Higginson, Francisca Onumah and Helena Russell. Showcasing a broad range of material disciplines, including glass, textiles, silversmithing and sculptural installation, the five commissions provide a snapshot of some of the most exciting new work being produced by UK-based artists and makers. Lilli Geissendorfer, Jerwood Arts’ director, said: “Jerwood Art Fund Makers Open creates a vital space for early-career artists and makers to experiment, learn, and take risks with their work. “We have been delighted to co-fund a dedicated curatorial role held by Svetlana Panova to guide this project, investing in essential talent development opportunities in the curatorial sector.” Shadows and Light – The Extraordinary Life of James McBey (February 11 – May 28) The celebrated Aberdeenshire-born artist and adventurer James McBey (1883-1959) was noted for his etchings and dry point engravings, and was once described as the “heir to Rembrandt”. This small-scale exhibition is curated by author Alasdair Soussi to coincide with his recently-published biography of McBey. The author’s research drew on the unparalleled archive of the artist’s personal collection of artworks, sketchbooks, scrapbooks, diaries and letters in the Archives, Gallery & Museums’ collection, a selection of which will be on display. Alasdair Soussi will give a talk at Aberdeen Art Gallery on Saturday April 15. Travelling Gallery (March) The contemporary gallery in a bus will be parked up in Aberdeen with a new two-person exhibition by artist Emmie McLuskey and choreographer Janice Parker which explores movement, bringing dance and people together in different ways and art forms. Look out for Travelling Gallery in locations across the city in March. The Testament of Alexander Jaffray (March 4 – September 3) 2023 marks the 350th anniversary of the death of Alexander Jaffray, twice provost of Aberdeen and representative of the burgh in the Scottish Parliament. This prominent member of the community later became a Quaker, at a time when doing so would mean persecution. This exhibition uses the manuscript of Jaffray’s last testament, acquired by Aberdeen City & Aberdeenshire Archives in 2022, as the starting point for a closer look at the man himself and the persecution. Where Ideas Are Born – an exhibition by Magnum Photos (April 1 – June 11) This exhibition brings together works by over 20 photographers from the celebrated Magnum agency, including Inge Morath, Eve Arnold and Robert Capa. Around 70 photo portraits of internationally renowned artists capture the moment in their studios. Making a Splash!

Quentin Blake – Illustrating Verse and Book Covers (July 8 – September 17) Two exhibitions under one roof at the Art Gallery will celebrate the unique talent of Quentin Blake, the UK’s best-loved illustrator, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday. Illustrating Verse brings together for the first time a selection Blake’s sketches and illustrations for a range of poetry, from comic nonsense poems to poignant ballads by writers including William Shakespeare and Roald Dahl. Book Covers demonstrates how Blake’s illustrations have grabbed the attention of readers of all ages over the past 60 years. The exhibition includes reproductions of cover artwork and rough sketches which give insights into Blake’s unmistakable and ever-popular way of working. Constructed Narratives: Lennox Dunbar, Ian Howard, Arthur Watson (October 14 – January 28 2024) This exhibition brings together three of Scotland’s foremost artists – Lennox Dunbar, Ian Howard and Arthur Watson. The Aberdeen-born contemporaries were educated at Aberdeen Grammar School, where art teacher Charles Hemingway encouraged them to spend time with the collection of contemporary art at Aberdeen Art Gallery. All three have key early works in the Aberdeen Art Gallery collection, which will be displayed here along with more recent pieces. Over their careers Dunbar, Howard and Watson have exhibited extensively across Europe, the United States and Asia, both together and as solo artists. Provost Skene’s House in 2023 More than 100 remarkable individuals from Aberdeen and the north-east are showcased in new interactive displays.

The Tolbooth Museum – temporarily closed The museum hasn’t reopened since it was shut at the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown in March 2020. A large crack had been discovered in an archway on the ground floor, risking the health and safety of visitors. As more investigations were carried out, more problems were found, including rusting metal embedded in the stonework. Councillors gave the go-ahead to all the necessary works, which would total £1.36 million, in early December. Click here for more information. Aberdeen Maritime Museum – temporarily closed Aberdeen Maritime Museum tells the story of the city’s long relationship with the sea. The venue closed in late November and will remain closed until spring 2023 while “essential repairs and maintenance” is carried out.

It's the opportunity of a lifetime for a business owner, and the 18 entrepreneurs are all hoping to win the £250,000 cash injection and invaluable advice from Lord Sugar. The full line-up for the show has been released ahead of it's return on Thursday and this year's looks more entertaining than ever before. This year's group features nine men and nine women who will all do their best to impress Lord Sugar and his advisors, Baroness Karren Brady, Tim Campbell and Claude Littner. The hit BBC show is now in its 17th season, and marks the first in person launch since 2019 due to the Covid pandemic. It began in 2005 as a groundbreaking show which featured some of the country's best young business minds hoping to secure a job with the then Sir Alan. However the programme has slowly turned into a more reality TV-inspired fare, with big personalities gloating irreverently about their skills in business. Among them are two sweetshop owners, two hairdressers, a martial arts instructor, and a pest control company owner and they will be put through their paces through a series of tricky tasks, with the first set in Antigua. The 20th anniversary of the series will air next year, with Lord Sugar saying he would do 20 years and then retire, having invested over £3million of his own money over the years. Meet all 18 candidates hoping to secure an investment for their business ideas. AVI SHARMA 'Some say I'm delusional, I prefer the term optimistic.' Avi is this year's youngest candidate, and works as a city banker in London. He describes himself as 'confident' and 'optimistic' and says he can 'bring a smile to the most miserable face!' He wants Lord Sugar's investment to help get him out of the 'rat race' of a banking job, boasting: 'I'm the hardest working rat he'll ever meet.' BRADLEY JOHNSON 'I have a business plan that will see us turn over seven figures after year three and who knows where else that could take us.' Bradley is a self-made businessman, who is the director of a construction company in North Yorkshire. He prides himself on his work ethic and drive which he claims has allowed him to create a business that turns over half-a-million after being made redundant just four years ago. He admits that his biggest weakness is public speaking, confessing: 'I was always the shy kid at school, I hated having to stand up and read in English lesson'. DANI DONOVAN 'My biggest weakness is also my biggest strength.' Dani owns a hair salon in Hertfordshire, which she started as a teenager and believes the key to business is 'passion'. She says she has a 'unique' personality and describes herself as 'a different kind of business owner, which is a lot more relatable to people.' Her self-confessed weakness, is 'that nothing is ever good enough and that I always want more. This is a weakness because then I'm never content with what I have achieved. But it's also a humongous strength – it is what has pushed me to come so far.' She believes she deserves to win the programme because her business fills a 'huge gap' in the market, saying: 'It baffles me that no one has done it yet!' DENISHA KAUR BHARJ 'I have always known what I wanted in life. I know the dreams I want to achieve. There's only one Denisha Kaur.' Denisha works as a financial controller in Leicestershire and says she's not afraid of getting out of her comfort zone. She describes herself as 'strong, motivated and hard-working' and says she can work under pressure, overcoming both professional and personal tests to reach success. Denisha says she wants the investment opportunity because she wants to 'be mentored by the best to be the best.' She argues she deserves it, because: 'I'm a woman who wants to create an empire and have it all; to be able to provide for my family and to be an inspiration to young women. I dream big, but I work extra hard and know everything is possible.' EMMA BROWNE 'I am disgustingly competitive. I will go to any lengths to win this investment.' Emma is a senior account executive in County Kildare and says she is 'extremely competitive' and a 'workaholic' who will 'do anything succeed'. She has over five years of hands-on sales experience and says she wants to ensure she will win tasks by being honest about her opinions. Describing her business idea, she says: 'I am confident that whether I win the investment from Lord Sugar or not, I am going to make my company one of the most successful ideas to ever come out of The Apprentice. Watch this space. GREGORY EBBS 'My biggest weakness, some could call a strength in my opinion, is sometimes being a little too unusual.' Gregory is the owner of an online antiques marketplace based in Shropshire and is also a local coucillor, while he previously worked as a professional cannon-firer. He says his USP is 'my ability to think outside the box and try out new and different things' and confesses to being 'slightly more unusual than most'. He says: 'I would say, a willingness to try different things and not being afraid to be slightly different is one of my biggest strengths. Speaking on his business idea, Gregory said: 'I think the chances of making this business super successful is greater than anybody else’s, because it’s such a fantastic principle.' JOSEPH PHILLIPS 'If Lord Sugar wants to invest in a business to help save the ocean, one lip balm at a time, then I’m his guy.' Joseph is a safari guide in South Africa, from Worcestshire and he believes that gives him the edge to be 'unique enough to succeed in the process', describing himself as the 'James Bond of the business world'. He admits that his biggest weakness is his dyslexia and say he 'struggled to keep my head above water' at school and keep up with his peers. But Joseph said the diagnosis has now become a driving force to succeed and go further as he wanted to prove that you can still be anything you want to be with dyslexia. He graciously adds: 'I don’t deserve Lord Sugar’s investment more than anyone else in the process, but I do think I have something that they don’t.' KEVIN D'ARCY 'With Lord Sugar as my business partner, I know we can ride that wave into the UK and beyond…' Kevin is an accountant from Dublin who began his water sports equipment business during lockdown while juggling his job. He claims his business has turned over just under half a million in two years and says that combined with his 10-year career in financial service sets him apart from the rest. Kevin admits his biggest weakness to be: 'I can be a little outspoken, so probably not knowing when to shut up.' MARK MOSELEY 'If Lord Sugar doesn’t pick me, then he’s missing a trick.' Mark is the owner of a pest control company in London, arguing that Lord Sugar can invest because the industry is worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year in the UK. He is also a former soldier who has worked all over the world in remote and hostile environments, meaning he should be right at home in the boardroom. He describes himself as 'very talkative with the charm to match – I can sell to anyone' and claims to have met celebrities and members of the royal family. Mark confesses he can be 'a little bit over-confident from time to time' but explains that 'people buy into confidence'. MARNIE SWINDELLS 'I have fought tooth and nail to get to where I am today with my business.' Marnie is a court advocate in London who is also a gold medal-winning boxer and imaginative businesswoman who is ready to face off against the other candidates. She says her USP is her 'imagination and creativity' but admits her passion and eagerness can sometimes translate as being too 'headstrong'. She says she deserves Lord Sugar's investment because: 'I think that taking the experience I have in the boxing industry and all the experience that he has in the business industry, together we would be a winning combination.' MEGAN HORNBY 'I think that no matter what situation I am thrown into, I will always give one hundred percent truth, even if it’s hard to hear.' Megan is the owner of a sweet shop and café in East Yorkshire and says her business has a 'real niche' in a gap in the market. She says her biggest asset is her honesty, saying it's the 'most important thing in business'. Her biggest weakness is her ambition, confessing: 'I can take too many things on, and sometimes I need to focus on certain aspects.' She says she should have the £250k because: 'I really think that with Lord Sugar’s investment, my business could be nationally recognised'. REECE DONNELLY 'I'm going to be turning over a million pounds before I’m thirty.' Reece is the owner of a performing arts school in Glasgow who is determined to become the first Scottish candidate to secure Lord Sugar's investment. He says he is the youngest CEO of a further education college in the UK and says he has 'all the experience, drive, and personality' to succeed. He admits that he can be guilty of neglecting the grunt work, saying: 'Admin or accounting tasks aren’t quite for me' but that this makes him a better leader who is able to delegate. Reece says he wants to prove: 'Scotland is filled with forward-thinking entrepreneurs and that we are not in fact a haggis-eating, kilt-wearing nation.' ROCHELLE ANTHONY 'I’m always being compared to the Kim Kardashian of the business world because I’m doing business with a hint of glam.' Rochelle owns a hair salon and academy in Bedfordshire and has compared herself to Kim Kardashian in the business world. She describes herself as 'tenacious, fierce and determined' and says together with Lord Sugar they would be 'an absolute force to be reckoned with.' According to Rochelle, her biggest weakness is she doesn't like the word 'no' and can't let go, instead turning it into a 'not yet', but learns from her mistakes. SHANNON MARTIN 'Lord Sugar needs to be my next business partner, so I can make him millions.' Shannon is the owner of bridal boutique from West Yorkshire and is hoping to be the first business partner to bring Lord Sugar into the lucrative bridal industry. She admits she struggles to prioritise and plan because 'I want everything now' and that it can cause a bit of stress. She believes she deserves the investment because: 'There are not many other businesses that design, and manufacture wedding dresses made solely in the UK, which is exactly what my business plan is.' SHAZIA HUSSAIN 'I don’t need any friends in business. I am here to win this.' Shazia is a technology recruiter in London and wants to inspire a varied representation of diverse women in the world of business. She says her ADHD is both her USP and biggest weakness, saying she can process information faster, react quicker and see things differently, but can lose concentration quickly. She says she should get the win because: 'It’s important to see a varied representation of women, including women with neurodiversity in business, as people with neurodiversity are linked to being increasingly successful within the corporate sector. I hope that I’ll encourage more people like me not to be ashamed of their difference.' SIMBA RWAMBIWA 'My USP is myself. If people can’t buy into you, they’ll never buy anything from you.' Simba is a senior sales representative from Birmingham and says he's a perfectionist as he always wants to 'get things right'. He says he deserves the investment opportunity because his business guarantee prpfit, 'but also guarantees to improve the quality of peoples’ lives'. SOHAIL CHOWHARY 'I am calm and collected, but if they do come at me? I will bite and I will sting, and I will leave my mark.' Sohail owns a martial arts school in Southampton and wants the otehr candidates to be 'wary' of him. He says his biggest asset is 'turning my laziness into a positive by creating smart solutions and simple shortcuts to difficult problems.' He admits his biggest weakness is not listening to others when 'on the very rare occasion I might be wrong' but says: 'I’ll always be the person that looks out for the little guy and sometimes that means that I will put emotions before business.' Sohail is proud to have grown up in a council house and worked his way up and adds: 'Owning a martial arts business means Lord Sugar can learn how to kick ass for free.'

Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. “We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love. And so our public services can start to improve for everyone who relies on them.” The move by Mr Nowak, in the first week as TUC general secretary, came as rail workers launched a 48 hour strike, with more stoppages planned this month in the transport industry, NHS and civil service.",New TUC boss calls for urgent meeting with Prime Minister,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/new-tuc-boss-calls-for-urgent-meeting-with-prime-minister-b2255515.html

Around half of Britain’s railway lines are closed and only a fifth of services are running as tens of thousands of workers at Network Rail and train operators walk out on the second day of the strike with bus drivers joining them. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction and said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline,” he wrote. Transport for London has revealed that bus strikes will take place today and tomorrow on Abellio bus services. There will still be buses available on the affected routes in south and west London, but not in their usual numbers. Meanwhile, industrial action by the UK-wide National Highways and Rural Payments Agency staff will continue. Recommended Who’s on strike today?

But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Commuters on their way to work cross London Bridge in central London on 3 January 2023 (AFP via Getty Images) Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. “We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love.

Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. It comes as rail workers continue a 48 hour strike, with more stoppages planned this month in the transport industry, NHS and civil service.

It wasn’t until this past year watching Musk, Johnson, Trump, King Charles, Truss, Clarkson (who is not out of the woods, however much cover The Sun give him) etc that it occurred to me that, if you are patient enough and prepared to witness massive collateral damage and waste of resources and unnecessary heartache, worsening socio-economic inequality and the debasement of living conditions for the most vulnerable – “they” implode...

Rishi Sunak has been warned that his “high risk” strategy on public sector pay rises could backfire, as an exclusive poll for The Independent showed strong public support for fresh strikes in 2023. Almost two in three voters would back NHS nurses taking more strike action next year if their pay demands are not met, the Savanta poll found, with only 24 per cent opposed. In addition, more voters expressed support for fresh industrial action by rail staff, bus drivers, postal workers and teachers than those who said they were opposed to further strikes. Adam Forrest reports: What does Britain really think about the strikes? As unions and government continue their stand-off, voters are still backing the workers who have chosen to walk out, polling finds – and they support more strikes in the new year, Adam Forrest reports Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 02:48 1672796880 As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be a good year for the unions After decades when it was – sadly – usually safe to ignore the pronouncements of union leaders, the most widespread outbreak of industrial action since 1979 has meant that they are household names once again. Not yet as familiar as, say, Mick Lynch, is the brand new general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, who formally takes over from Frances (now Baroness) O’Grady on 1 January. He is, though, making a somewhat loud entrance. He told The Independent that the strikes could carry on throughout 2023 if the government refuses to negotiate over pay rises. If we take ministers at their word, that they won’t do so until at least the new public pay body recommendations arrive in April, then the country is in for a prolonged period of conflict. Writes Sean O’Grady: As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be good for the unions The economic reality is on the side of the unions, and Rishi Sunak lacks Thatcher’s sharp political instinct, writes Sean O'Grady Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 01:48 1672793280 I’m a nurse – this is why I voted to strike Ever since I was a young child, I dreamt of being a nurse that worked for the NHS. Twelve years ago, after lots of hard work and determination, I achieved that goal. There were lots of sacrifices from my family, who supported me throughout my course. I currently work as a deputy sister in an NHS hospital in Lincolnshire. My role is as part of an acute cardiology team that has face to face contact with patients that attend the hospital after having heart attacks and following cardiac arrests.

RCN members in England will continue their strike. 23 January Unison members working for five ambulance services in England will stage another walkout. 25 January London bus workers at Abellio will go on strike. 26 January London bus workers at Abellio will continue strike. Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 23:34 1672786137 Who is striking this winter and why? Workers in several of Britain’s key service sectors are striking in what is being called the new “winter of discontent” as cost of living pressures clash with below-inflation pay offers. Many strikes, such as that of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), have been going on for months, with warnings union members will vote to take their fight far into 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the highest monthly total since November 2011 saw mass public sector walkouts over pension reforms. Liam James reports: Who is striking this winter and why? Workers are walking out in droves over the coming weeks Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 22:48 1672783170 Bus strikes planned for Wednesday TfL has said that strike are planned for Wednesday and Thursday on Abellio bus services. On the strike days, TfL writes that they intend to run as many services as possible, but expect disruption. Routes affected by the strikes are, for the most part, in west and south London. Other bus services will not be affected.

The wild salmon is one of Scotland’s most iconic species, earning its place alongside the red deer, the golden eagle, and the Scottish wildcat. But, like so many other animals, its numbers have been in decline for decades. The population of wild salmon is diminishing on the west coast of Scotland, and even faster on the east coast. Reasons for the fall are many and varied, but a key cause is habitat loss and rising river temperatures, due to climate change. The Scottish Government has also identified other pressures facing wild salmon, including predation by fish, birds and seals, as well as the non-native plans that erode riverbanks. Man-made barriers to migration, such as weirs and bridge foundations, lead to further challenges for the fish, impeding their migration to spawning grounds and increasing the likelihood of them being eaten. The sad truth is that a wild Atlantic salmon now has a miniscule survival rate of only around 1-2%. That contrasts sharply with farm-raised salmon, where the survival rate is around 85% over their two years in the cold seas off Scotland’s west coast. Daily animal husbandry from our salmon farmers, supported by the best vets in the land, has developed world-leading expertise in hatching and rearing salmon that thrive at sea. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part There are a handful of vocal activists, often from urban centres far from rural Scotland, determined to shut down salmon farms – which would make 12,000 people unemployed amid a cost of living crisis – who mistakenly believe that this would somehow help wild salmon. They have no explanation, of course, for the fact that wild salmon numbers are declining at the same rate on the east coast, where there has never been any salmon farming. What is needed is collaboration, not confrontation. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part in finding solutions, engaging constructively with the wild fish sector, and taking meaningful action to save wild salmon. They are determined, for example, to share their knowledge and experience to support wild fisheries with restocking. Fortunately, most people in the fisheries and angling sectors in the Highlands and Islands recognise the importance of a healthy, shared environment, ensuring fish can thrive in our waters. People like Jon Gibb, a fisheries manager based in Fort William, get that. He has long championed a constructive relationship between the farm-raised salmon sector and fisheries and angling groups, arguing that “both the farmed and wild salmon sectors have a common interest to thrive in our shared space”. I agree, which is why I’m delighted that Jon has agreed to coordinate our revamped £1.5 million “wild fisheries fund”, which is paid for directly by Scotland’s salmon farming companies. Funding to protect our salmon heritage The Scottish salmon sector has already funded projects to save and restore a historic dam in the Western Isles that assists wild salmon to progress to their spawning grounds, as well as restoration projects across Scotland that will reduce riverbank erosion and provide tree canopy and in-stream cover for young salmon. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks In the coming year, £145,000 will be available to a broad range of organisations and projects. Applications are invited from fisheries organisations, including local angling clubs, fishery boards and other community associations. The revamped fund will prioritise applications of a practical nature, which aim to protect and enhance wild salmon populations and local angling opportunities, recognising that salmon and trout fishing is at the cultural heart of many Highland communities, and provides human health benefits. Projects could include removing migration barriers, evidence-based and authorised restocking programmes, hatchery-based operations using contemporary techniques, such as genetic screening, and freshwater habitat improvement, like spawning gravel creation. Money is also available for improvements to angling facilities, including riverside paths, boats and buildings, as well as initiatives to support young and disabled anglers. Scottish salmon is part of our national story. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks. We recognise that today’s Scottish salmon farming sector enjoys its strong reputation and success partly due to this heritage. It is in all of our interests to ensure that we protect our freshwater and seawater environment so that one of Scotland’s most iconic species can recover and thrive.

Hardies Property & Construction Consultants is currently renovating its offices in the city. Once the offices on Albert Square are ready, bosses plan to have staff from Hardies and its sister company Shepherds working under the same roof. They will be joined by workers from the recently-acquired John Duguid Partnership. Hardies investment in Dundee offices Gareth Cordiner, the firm’s north division managing partner, believes this will make a real difference. He said: “It’s hugely important especially after Covid. We do have a flexible working policy but we’ve found people want to be back in the office and back together. “The amount of information you share from hearing it across the room, it makes a big difference. “From a mental health point of view it’s brilliant. You see relationships building again, so there’s huge benefits.” Douglas Smith, who was appointed Dundee partner recently, added: “We’ll have our one-stop-shop under one roof and that’s really exciting. “It needs to be a more modern way, with collective thinking.” Mr Smith also outlined his ambition for Hardies to become the go-to business for anyone’s surveying requirements in Dundee. “It’s a pretty exciting time for Hardies in Dundee,” he said. “We’ve got a fairly big team that are looking to make giant strides in the Tayside area moving forward. “We’re trying to build the Hardies brand. “In Dundee, we’re trying to make it a one-stop shop surveying service across all disciplines – building surveying, quantity surveying, you name it, we’re doing it. “We’re going to target sectors we want to work in.” Tayside offices crucial for Hardies Mr Cordiner said its presence in Tayside and Fife – the firm also has offices in Dunfermline, St Andrews and Perth – are key to the business. He added: “Dundee and Perth work closely together as the Tayside region. “Historically in Dundee quantity surveying-wise, we’re historically very strong and very well known. “Joining up with the John Duguid Partnership we’re keen that we become the strongest quantity surveying team in Tayside. “I don’t think we’re far off that at the moment.” Mr Smith said the firm’s progress would be based on “considered and selective movement”.",Dundee property firm looking to make &#8216;giant strides&#8217; in Tayside,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/business-environment/business/4001080/hardies-dundee/

Achieving this will need an energy revolution in this country requiring millions of tonnes of steel to build new energy generation projects. ""A strong domestic and secure steel industry is also fundamental to delivering the UK Government’s ambitious energy plans. “But if British manufacturers are to supply the essential steel and continue to employ many thousands of people in this country, we need to invest and transform this strategically-important industry so it can make carbon-neutral steel. “Similarly, our steel industry is at a crossroads – if we do nothing, we risk it declining and drifting away to other countries. Down the other path is a new era in which we transform the steel production process to make it fit for the 21st Century.” Henrik added: “Geo-political events and disruptive trade issues in recent years have reminded us of the importance of being self-sufficient in essential products like steel, a product critical for the UK’s infrastructure projects, manufacturing industry and national security.” Roy Rickhuss CBE, General Secretary of Community and NTUSCC Chair, said: “The green energy revolution presents a huge opportunity to build a robust British supply chain based on the supply of top-quality domestic steel.""

British wrestler Zack Sabre Jr, who has been vocally anti-Tory in the past, stepped out for a high stakes match at New Japan Pro Wrestling’s (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom 17 event in front of a packed Tokyo Dome crowd. With a global audience tuning in to see former WWE superstar Sasha Banks make her heavily rumoured debut, the 35-year-old grappler took his opportunity to shine a light on the action being taken by the Royal College of Nursing (RNC). Back in November, for the first first time in its 106 year history the RNC voted in favour of strikes, as walkouts affected hospitals across the country with more set to take place on January 18 and 19. Zack has joined those criticising the government over the dispute, and he sent a very blunt message for the Prime Minister as he made his entrance on Wednesday (January 4). Looking straight down the camera, he said: ‘Hey Rishi Sunak! Pay nurses, d**khead! Pay nurses a living wage!’ Zack has a message for the prime minister pic.twitter.com/ECbWf0EX1O— Elijah (@eli1ah) January 4, 2023 Zack Sabre Jr has fans around the world (Picture: Etsuo Hara/Getty Images) Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said last month that the union had ‘no choice’ but to arrange the upcoming strikes. She said: ‘The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January. ‘The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.’ The union is campaigning for a five percent pay rise above inflation to help nurses overcome those real-terms pay cuts, to support nursing staff through the cost of living crisis and recognise their critical skills. There are also record nursing vacancies, with 25,000 nursing staff having quit in the past year, but Mr Sunak previously said while the government was open to talks, a demand for a 19% pay rise wasn’t affordable. He told BBC News NI in December: ‘The health secretary has always been clear that his door is always open for talks – we want to be reasonable, we want to be constructive. ‘We’ve got enormous gratitude for all public sector workers for the job they do, and I know things are difficult right now.’ Got a story?

Al-Quds reported that they had been deported for a range of reasons, including drug abuse, theft, expiration of residency and acting against the public interest. Egyptians are the largest expat group in Kuwait, constituting 24 per cent of the workforce, though that number looks set to reduce as the government works on controlling the labour market and reducing the number of expats across all sectors, particularly within the government. In 2018 Kuwait's Civil Service Commission issued a decree to replace expats in government jobs with Kuwaitis over the next five years. Since then, authorities have rolled out a series of measures aimed at reducing foreign workers in the country. In 2020 Kuwait's parliament said it wanted to reduce the number of Egyptians in the country to ten per cent and introduced a draft law to that effect. In December this year the Kuwaiti government imposed new conditions on Egyptian workers wishing to travel to the Gulf State including a $100 entry fee, an increased work permit documentation fee and a medical examination. READ: Kuwait: death sentence for man who killed woman who refused his advances At the time, Deputy Prime Minister Talal Al-Khaled suspended a 2018 memorandum of understanding which was originally signed to facilitate recruitment between the two countries but did not officially inform Egypt it was being terminated. Four months earlier Kuwait announced that it would lay off 250,000 Egyptian workers and suspend all contracts with non-nationals as 500,000 other Egyptians were already set to lose their jobs. Egyptians have suffered racism in the Gulf country with a video of a Kuwaiti customer slapping an Egyptian cashier two years ago going viral. One influencer called Egyptians ""filthy servants."" Even though they are the largest expatriate group in Kuwait, Egyptians lack employment rights and safety provision. In November last year an Egyptian construction worker was killed in Kuwait allegedly after his colleagues dumped rubbish on him from the third floor after not realising he was below them. A 2015 report on migrant rights found that industry corruption, including overextending project timelines and using cheap materials, put construction workers at risk.

Members of Aslef in 15 train operators will walk out, leaving large parts of the country with no trains all day.Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan told the PA news agency it was “inevitable” that further strikes will be held unless there is a breakthrough to the long running row.He warned that strikes could escalate, saying train drivers wanted to go “harder and faster” after years of not receiving a pay rise.His comments came as train passengers suffered more disruption on Wednesday because of the second day of a 48 hour stoppage by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) in a separate dispute over pay, jobs and conditions. Another RMT 48 hour strike will start on Friday, ending a week of travel chaos on the railways,On Wednesday, around half of Britain’s railway lines were closed and only a fifth of services ran as tens of thousands of RMT members at Network Rail and 14 train operators walked out.Mr Whelan told PA he felt rail employers and the Government were “playing games” rather than making any serious attempt to resolve the pay dispute.“The situation is getting worse and my members now want to go harder and faster because of the lack of progress.“We are in a weird world where the Government will do anything to keep private companies in the industry.“It is inevitable that more strikes will be held and probably escalate.“The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us.“We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing, and that is unacceptable.”Among the operators which will run no trains all day on Thursday are Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Northern, Southern, Southeastern, Thameslink and TransPennine Express.Rail links to the UK’s two busiest airports will be cut, with Gatwick Express and Heathrow Express shutting down.Areas where trains will run on Thursday include: Wales; the Central Belt, Fife and the Borders of Scotland; and parts of the South Western Railway network.Services will also operate on London Overground and the Elizabeth line.Around 20% of normal services will run, according to the Rail Delivery Group. Companies affected by the strike are Avanti West Coast; Chiltern Railways; CrossCountry; East Midlands Railway; Great Western Railway; Greater Anglia; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; London North Eastern Railway; Northern Trains; Southeastern; Southern/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway (depot drivers only); SWR Island Line; TransPennine Express; and West Midlands Trains.New TUC leader Paul Nowak has written to the Prime Minister calling for an urgent meeting to discuss the wave of industrial disputes across the country including on the railways, NHS and civil service.He called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions.In the letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing”.He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline.“Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it.“This is simply unsustainable.“But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes.“That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.”Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now.“Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution.“In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers.

Next, we need to stop seeing education is something that ends at age 18 or that sees university as the only option with more technical education, lifelong learning and apprenticeship,” he said. We're holding the first BUSINESSiQ Awards - to nominate someone, CLICK HERE He told an audience in Stratford: “One of the biggest changes in mindset we need in education today is to reimagine our approach to numeracy. Right now, just half of all 16 to 19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills, is letting our children down.” Rishi Sunak (Image: PA) Grant Glendinning, Chief Executive and Group Principal at Education Training Collective (Etc.), replied: “I fully agree with the Prime Minister, opportunity is intrinsically linked with education – ensuring that learners have access to the best possible learning experiences. However, while maths, and English, are important and critical foundations of any education pathway towards employment, they do not work in isolation. ""Skills as a whole, starting with English and maths, developed from primary into secondary education, supported by additional learning and development in further education or in the workplace as part of an apprenticeship or T Level, are what will see our young people best positioned to take advantage of the careers and opportunities they pursue, supporting the economic growth of our country. Grant Glendinning (Image: Press release) It will be interesting to understand how this will be rolled out, but with the best interests of our learners and our communities firmly at the heart of Etc. colleges, it is difficult to see how enhanced skills development can be anything but a positive.” Zoe Lewis, Principal and Chief Executive of Middlesbrough College, told us: ""The UK is one of the few developed nations that reduces the time spent in education from around 25 hours per week from the age of 5 to 16 years old to around 16 hours per week between the ages of 16 and 18. Zoe Lewis (Image: Press release) ""We would welcome any opportunity to increase the hours available to continue the development of key skills required for life and the workplace in our young people, whether this be mathematics, English, digital, physical education or employability skills. ""Whilst we would not necessarily single out mathematics from the list of priority skills, we would very much support any increase in investment between in the ages of 16 and 18, alongside a clear plan as to how we can develop and train the increased numbers of teachers that would be required, in light of the current shortages across the sector."" Henri Murison, Chief Executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership said businesses needed young people who were ready for work: ""The Prime Minister is right to be concerned about the progress made by disadvantaged children in this country,"" he said. ""It is simply not good enough that 60% of children do not receive a high enough grade at GCSE in maths to make it on to a T-Level course or other vocation routes to further study. Henri Murison (Image: Press release) ""However it's worth noting that already many young people are studying maths post 16 through resits, in order to get the grade they need to make it through to the system to achieve a higher level of skills.

After the disappointments of the previous decade, this was to be the time when the global economy powered up and got going again. There would be a flowering of new technologies and a colossal boom. It would be the roaring 20s all over again. It hasn’t worked out like that. Instead, the world faces the grim prospect of a second recession in three years. The three biggest economies – the United States, China and the European Union, which between them account for roughly half of all global output – are slowing at the same time. That’s unusual and troubling. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, says a third of the world economy will be in recession in 2023, and even for countries that manage to keep growing it will feel like a recession. The IMF has got it wrong – sometimes seriously wrong – in the past but even so, Georgieva’s pessimism is warranted. Just about every indicator of looming recession is flashing red. Prices are rising faster than wages, reducing consumer spending power. Corporate profitability is being squeezed by rising costs and weakening demand. Developing countries that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are now finding their debt burdens unmanageable. The two big asset bubbles of the post-pandemic era – crypto-currencies and tech stocks – both collapsed in 2022. Central banks are raising interest rates, exposing the vulnerability of “zombie” companies that have survived only thanks to a prolonged period of low interest rates. It is a lot cheaper in the US to borrow money for 10 years than it is to borrow money for one year. In the past this unusual phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale sign of a recession in the offing. China hauled the global economy out of its last serious downturn but is in no shape to do so this time. House prices have been rising at double-digit rates for the past three decades but are now falling in many cities because the boom has led to more and more homes being built. Politically, President Xi Jinping cannot afford a house price crash so he can bring demand and supply back into balance only by curbing property construction. That, coupled with the increase in coronavirus cases since the end of the zero tolerance approach to Covid-19, means China is the country to watch in 2023. The IMF says that for the first time since the early 1990s, China will grow less quickly than the global economy as a whole. It could be worse than the IMF envisages. So, the big question is not whether the global economy is in for a rough year in the 12 months ahead, because that is clearly the case. There may be one or two countries that buck the trend, but the UK is not going to be one of them. Another year of underperformance will keep the debate about Brexit alive, even though adjustment to life outside the EU is not the only – let alone the principal reason – for the UK’s current predicament. This is a global rather than a UK-specific problem, and it predates Brexit. Nor is the question why the bounce-back from the Covid-19 pandemic has been cut short, because that too is obvious. The post-lockdown recovery was built on the shakiest of foundations. Shortages led to a burst of inflation, amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks in the west found themselves powerless to combat a cost of living crisis other than by jacking up interest rates. The recessions or near recessions that will be seen in the US, the EU and the UK this year are no accident. They are a deliberate act of policy, which central bankers justify by saying it is a choice between pain now or more pain later. No, the real issue is whether the roaring 20s have been delayed or will never arrive. Put another way: is the global economy facing a temporary, if nasty, period of stagflation (a combination of weak growth and high inflation) or something deeper: a crisis of capitalism? And if it is the latter, what can be done about it? History may well repeat itself. The 1920s began with a pandemic, an inflationary boom and a deep recession. It took a while for better times to arrive, and when they did the driving force was a wave of new inventions, first developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but which took time to reveal their full potential. Techno-optimists say artificial intelligence and biotechnology will be to the 2020s what radio and the motorcar were to the 1920s: the catalyst for a period of markedly faster growth. They believe a period of abnormally lower interest rates has held back a fourth industrial revolution by allowing no-hoper companies to stagger on. A period of creative destruction will see this misallocation of capital end, leading to higher investment in the industries of the future. But the global economy has now been in the doldrums for 15 years. Money has been cheap and plentiful ever since the banks nearly went bust during the global financial crisis. There is not much evidence to suggest that the fourth industrial revolution is being held back by a shortage of capital. Rather, there has been a reluctance by both governments and the private sector to invest. Governments could have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs to rebuild clapped-out infrastructure, but failed to do so. The private sector preferred to use profits to buy back shares rather than taking a punt on new products. Financial engineering proved lucrative for elites, who assumed – quite wrongly – that because the system was working for them it was working for everybody. In one respect, the roaring 20s have already returned. While living standards are being squeezed for the many, for the super-rich it is a new gilded age. Three factors were behind the massive jump in productivity in the middle decades of the 20th century: ideas, investment and the struggle against inequality. Economies only really started to motor when new products were available to the masses through policies that encouraged full employment, collective bargaining and rising wages. Currently, there are plenty of ideas but the other two factors are missing. Until that changes, the global economy will be stuck in its low-growth rut.

It is estimated just 10% of services will be running on one of the worst days of action for decades. Around 12,500 train drivers from 15 firms will take part in the mass walkout. It comes as over the last week we have seen strike action from 40,000 workers on Network Rail and 14 train operating companies who have continued to strike. RMT members were on strike for 48 hours causing travel chaos for people across the UK. But today it is the turn of Aslef – which represents 96% of the train drivers in England, Scotland and Wales – who will continue into their second day of strikes in two days. Rail workers on the picket line at Grand Central Station in Birmingham yesterday (Picture: PA) MORE : What strikes are planned around New Year 2023? Trains, London buses, road workers and more The strike will bring services on affected lines to a halt and comes as more and more people in many different sectors of the economy are withdrawing their labour as employers refuse to help their employees during the cost-of-living crisis. But it’s not the end, as those from The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers are also set to walk out tomorrow and on Friday. It includes train drivers at 15 rail operators and is likely to shut down much of the country’s rail network. On all five days of action, trains will start later and finish much earlier than usual, running between 7.30am and 6.30pm, National Rail has warned. Tickets for 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 January can instead be used the day before the date on the ticket, or up to and including Tuesday 10 January.

Train drivers are joined today by London bus workers at Abellio, who are striking for eight days in total this month. Abellio buses have been affected on strike days – with other buses running but busier than usual. The action started back on December 8, but the bus strike dates around New Year included today and yesterday. Dozens of buses in London are going to be impacted by strikes. Rural Payments Agency (RPA) staff will also resume their strikes. Driving tests have likewise been disrupted today – with DVSA driving examiners’ strike starting in London, the South East, South Wales and the South West. ‘We don’t want to go on strike but the companies have pushed us into this place,’ said Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He added: ‘They have not offered our members at these companies a penny – and these are people who have not had an increase since April 2019. ‘That means they expect train drivers at these companies to take a real-terms pay cut – to work just as hard for considerably less – when inflation is running at north of 14%.’ Mick said: ‘The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us. ‘We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing.

The latest statistics on Scotland’s energy production (not oil and gas reserves) showed that over the first nine months of 2022, generation was up 34.7% compared to the same period in 2021 Final figures for 2021 show that the equivalent of 85.2% of all electricity used in Scotland (total generation minus net exports) came from renewable sources. Due to slightly better weather in 2021 this was actually a slight decrease, but has bounced back up again with the 2022 figures. The energy that is generated in Scotland is exported into the UK National Grid. Consumers in Scotland then buy it back. The further north you go in Scotland the tariff paid for buying it back, increases. So although places like Orkney and the massive windfarms in the north of mainland Scotland are producing well over their own needs in renewables, they are also paying the highest prices to buy back their own locally produced power. Scotland produces most of its renewable energy through wind but hydro is also very important. The future with wave and tidal power makes Scotland’s future as a producer of clean energy very bright. Oil and Gas in the UK Scotland still produces large amounts of fossil fuels through its existing extensive oil and gas fields. The income generated from these sources goes into the UK Exchequer. The UK Government is also very keen to open up more oil and gas fields. Figures from the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) The oil and gas industry plays a central role in the economy of the United Kingdom. Oil and gas account for more than three-quarters of the UK’s total primary energy needs. Oil provides 97 per cent of the fuel for transport, and gas is a key fuel for heating and electricity generation. Transport, heating and electricity each account for about one-third of the UK’s primary energy needs. Oil and gas are also major feedstocks for the petrochemicals industries producing pharmaceuticals, plastics, cosmetics and domestic appliances. Wikipedia Click on this link for more information on UK Oil and Gas: North Sea Transition Authority Scotland’s Renewable Production Energy is mostly a reserved power to the UK Government. The Scottish Government has planning power over the development of wind farms as we have seen recently in Orkney (OIC Faray Windfarm Approved by Scottish Government Despite Reporter’s Recommendation to Refuse ) and licences to develop offshore wind. (Islanders Attend Consultation Events for the West of Orkney Windfarm) There is a major expansion of the wind generation sector in Scotland. In the last twelve months, renewable electricity capacity has risen, up 11.7% from September 2021 to 13.6 GW in September 2022. As of September 2022, 397 renewable electricity projects with a capacity of 17.1 GW are being progressed. 3.4 GW of these are under construction, most of which are offshore wind farms off the Moray Firth. 6.8 GW are awaiting construction and 6.9 GW in planning. The generation and use of energy is a complex picture in Scotland. As part of the UK and with a devolved system of government, control over energy is mostly reserved to the London Government. Oil and Gas is a major sector. The UK Government intends to expand both this and Nuclear production. As well as producing energy we also need to use less but as the weather in 2022 was better for renewable generation it also made our homes and businesses harder to heat. Fuel poverty should not exist in a country which generates so much energy – but it does because we do not control the price or have the means to do so. Scottish Government funded schemes to make our homes and businesses more energy efficient are extremely important (more about that here, Home Energy Scotland). But Scotland still relies very much on fossil fuels.

There is a cost to our landscape and seascape. But, in a climate emergency why is the UK Government developing non-renewable energy sources? And where is the hope for Scots struggling to pay their energy bills when they pay the highest rates in the UK to buy back that same power they see being generated where they live?

The Department for Transport (DfT) rejects the accusation, saying ministers have held “polite, constructive meetings” with union bosses. Train drivers employed by 15 rail firms have walked out for 24 hours in a dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions. It is the sixth Aslef drivers’ strike since summer 2022, and is bracketed by 48-hour stoppages by the main rail union, the RMT. Many operators will run no trains on Thursday. Ahead of the walk-out, Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, blamed ministers for triggering the strike. He told The Independent: “We currently have government that seems to want to destroy the railway and put it into managed decline, alienate the workforce, drive passengers off it by increasing fares on a regular basis and causing the problems that are currently there. “We find ourselves in a cycle of – I can only say – corruption, really. The government destroying the railway. The government’s caused this, the government can solve it.” The Department for Transport (DfT) rejected the comments, saying that the transport secretary Mark Harper and rail minister Huw Merriman had been talking to union leaders about their desire for a thriving railway. A spokesperson for the DfT said: “The transport secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long-term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation, and costing every household an extra £1,000.” When Mr Harper entered office 10 weeks ago, he said his top priority was to end the long and bitter tangle of rail disputes between Network Rail, the train operators and the unions. Another two-day RMT strike begins at midnight, causing the cancellation of four out of five trains across Great Britain and disrupting services until Sunday. Network Rail says footfall at its 20 managed stations on Tuesday morning – the first day of this week’s RMT walkouts – was down by five-sixths on normal levels.",Government seeking to ‘destroy the railway’ says train drivers’ union boss,https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/government-rail-train-driver-union-strike-b2256387.html

The events were created by Developing the Young Workforce (DYW) Inverness & Central Highland, in collaboration with the UHI Inverness college and Skills Development Scotland. They gave S2-S4 Inverness school pupils the opportunity to engage directly with NHS Highland workers and other employers, in a bid to help them make better informed decisions about their future careers. NHS Highland hosted stalls centred around a range of different professions under the health and care umbrella including healthcare science, medical, nursing, dental, midwifery, pharmacy, and adult social care. At each stall teams carried out different interactive “hands-on” activities with young people to provide some experience and educate them about the different services and job roles. Activities showcased included basic life support, clinical skills demonstrations, birthing activities, mental health awareness and dementia awareness with insights into the challenges posed for older adults, and much more. Lori Pattinson, workforce planning manager for NHS Highland was delighted. “We were so excited for our employees to have the chance to meet and engage with young people in order to inspire and inform them about future career opportunities in health and social care within NHS Highland,” she said. “We hope we’ve been able to encourage these young people to pursue a career in health or social care, and become a part of our future workforce.” Three events held at Inverness Royal Academy, Culloden Balloch Baptist Church and Millburn Academy, attracted about 1500 young people to meet with local employers and key sectors most important to the Highland economy, including construction, engineering, hospitality, retail and STEM, as well as health and social care.

Train drivers who are members of the Aslef union working for 15 different companies have walked out for 24 hours, leaving very few trains between England and Scotland running. Among the operators that will run no services at all on Thursday are Avanti West Coast, TransPennine Express, East Midlands Railway, Great Northern, London Northwestern, Northern, Southeastern, Southern, ThamesLink, West Midlands and CrossCountry. Chiltern Railways will not run any services on either Thursday or Friday, while Southwestern’s Island Line will not run on Thursday. Areas where trains will run on Thursday include: Wales; the Central Belt, Fife and the Borders of Scotland; and parts of the South Western Railway network. Rail links to the UK’s two busiest airports will also be cut, with Gatwick Express and Heathrow Express shutting down. The Stansted Express will run just one train per hour on Thursday. On London North Eastern Railway (LNER), the London King’s Cross to Edinburgh route will operate with just five trains in each direction. It is the sixth Aslef train drivers’ strike since summer 2022, and is bracketed by 48-hour stoppages by the main rail union, the RMT, scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday of this week.

Danske Bank has revised its previous forecast of a 0.5% annual fall in economic activity in 2023 downwards and now expects output to contract by about 1% next year. It believes the retail sector will be worst affected by recession, shrinking by 4.5% in 2023, more than twice a predicted contraction rate of 2.2% for this year. Conor Lambe, Danske Bank chief economist, said: “The UK economy contracted in the third quarter of 2022 and we think that economic activity in Northern Ireland is also likely to have declined. Output is then projected to fall further in the final quarter of the year and through most of next year, with both economies experiencing a period of recession as a number of factors adversely impact activity levels. “Inflation is expected to decline gradually during 2023 but remain elevated and weigh down on household purchasing power. Consumer confidence is also particularly low and monetary policy is tightening. “Looking forward, and while noting the considerable uncertainty around the outlook, we expect annual output in Northern Ireland to decline by around 1% next year.” But the bank has forecast that the economy will have grown by around 4% by the end of this year, reflecting a relative improvement on the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses and consumers have been hit by rising costs throughout 2022, with inflation prompting the Bank of England to increase interest rates to 3%. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK economy shrank by 0.3% over the three months to October, although there was a rebound in October itself. As well as retail, other consumer-facing sectors such as accommodation and food, along with arts, entertainment and recreation, are also predicted to take heavy hits during 2023. Danske Bank forecast declines of nearly 4% for both sectors. And output for manufacturing companies is also expected to shrink next year, with a 1.1% fall in output, while the construction sector is tipped for a similar rate of contraction. However, slight growth is predicted for the world of information and communication, as well as scientific and technical services. And education and administrative and support services are also predicted to avoid decline.",Northern Ireland facing continued recession in 2023,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/ulsterbusiness/news/northern-ireland-facing-continued-recession-in-2023-42264137.html

Children in years 1, 2 and 3, between the ages of five and eight, will be given age-appropriate lessons designed to introduce them to different careers, training and skills, and inspire them about the world of work. The £2.6m initiative will be introduced across 55 education investment areas, or “cold spots”, where school outcomes are the weakest, targeting 600,000 pupils in more than 2,200 primary schools. Pupils will get the chance to meet employers and “role models” from a range of industries, to try to raise aspirations and link learning to future jobs and careers they may pursue. They will be introduced to careers in the green economy, technology, engineering, construction, Stem, creative industries, aerospace, hospitality and healthcare. The Department for Education (DfE) said evidence had shown that children started to form ideas about their future when they began primary school, yet most careers guidance took place in secondary schools. In addition to the primary careers programme, the DfE also gave details of a new requirement for secondary school pupils to be given greater exposure to providers of technical education, so they know about alternatives to a traditional academic route. Under legislation that came into force at the start of the year, schools will be required to give all pupils in years 8 to 13 at least six opportunities to meet a range of providers of technical education, including apprenticeships, T-levels and higher technical qualifications. Robert Halfon, the minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said good careers advice was vital to open up opportunities for young people from all backgrounds and create the future workforce the UK needed. “The changes we are making to boost our careers programme will raise ambitions from an early age for thousands of children in primary schools across the country, while providing opportunities to unlock talent, think about skills, engage with employers and discover different workplaces.” Oli de Botton, a former headteacher who is chief executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company, which will coordinate the primary careers programme, said: “Our new primary programme will bring careers inspiration to children early in their school life by connecting them with role models and showing them how different subjects relate to jobs.” The education charity Teach First will help train primary school teachers in disadvantaged areas where the scheme will be introduced. Dominic Wyse, a professor of early childhood and primary education at University College London’s Institute of Education, said the initiative’s success would depend on how well it was delivered. “It does worry me it could be terribly dull. There’s a real question – will it motivate children, will it motivate teachers, and is it the sort of push that’s needed right now?” Sarah Hannafin, a senior policy adviser for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), whose members mainly work in the primary sector, said it was right that careers education should not be left to secondary schools. However, she added: “All schools must be provided with the resources they need to provide high-quality careers education, but current provision remains underfunded. Schools will find it challenging to meet increasing requirements and expectations with no additional resources to deliver them.”",Children as young as five in England target of new careers programme,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/05/children-young-five-england-urged-think-about-careers

RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: “Curtailing workers’ freedom to participate in lawful industrial action is always undemocratic and we will look closely at what the Government releases. “We will meet with ministers to see their evidence for the pay process. However, only negotiations on our dispute can avert the planned action this month and I urge the Prime Minister to show a renewed sense of urgency, grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses without further delay. “As for minimum staffing, last month’s action was safe for patients because of detailed discussions we chose to initiate with the NHS to protect emergency services and life-saving care. The public respected that and even ministers acknowledged our constructive approach. “Safe staffing levels that are set in law are what we want to see year-round not just in these extreme circumstances. “We’ve long campaigned for governments to be accountable for safe and effective staffing levels in NHS and social care to prevent one nurse being left with 15, 20 or even 25 sick patients. “The evidence is unequivocal – safe staffing saves lives and having the right number of registered nurses on duty has a direct impact on the safety and quality of patient care. Today’s highly unsafe situation is what is driving our members to say ‘enough is enough’.” Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect said: “This hollow invitation ignores the fact that a majority of public sector workers are not covered by a pay review body, including nearly all civil servants. We have been calling for years for this to be rectified, something which the Government has consistently ignored. “These workers have been some of the most harshly treated over the past decade of real-terms pay cuts, and now the Government is signalling its intent to leave them out once again. “Our members have already indicated their willingness to take industrial action and there is nothing in this announcement that will persuade us not to proceed to a formal ballot as planned.” Unison’s assistant general secretary Jon Richards said: “Ministers should focus their time and energy on rebuilding trust and relationships with workers, not silencing and suppressing them. “Minimum staffing levels in the NHS would be welcome by the public and health staff every single day of the week. That could avoid people being left lying in agony on A&E floors or dying in the backs of ambulances. “The NHS is on its knees because of record vacancies. The idea of limiting legal staffing levels to strike days and threatening to sack or fine health workers at such a time shows proper patient care isn’t ministers’ priority. “The Government is picking ill-advised fights with NHS employees and unions to mask years of dismal failure to tackle pay and staffing.” TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “This is an attack on the right to strike. It’s an attack on working people, and it’s an attack on one of our longstanding British liberties. “It means that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don’t. That’s wrong, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal. “The announcement offers nothing more to help with this year’s pay and the cost-of-living crisis. “The only offer of talks is for next year. But we need to resolve the current disputes and boost the pay of public sector workers now. “The Prime Minister said yesterday his door is always open – if he’s serious, he should prove it. He should take up my offer to get around the table to improve this year’s pay and end the current disputes. “There is a world of difference between promises of jam tomorrow with technical discussions about pay review bodies, and proper negotiations on pay in the here and now. “Our public services are already deep in a staffing crisis. But this Government has gone from clapping key workers to threating them with the sack if they take lawful action for a pay rise. It will only push more people away from essential jobs in public services, harming the whole nation.” Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said: “Just when you thought the Government could go no lower, ministers say they’re looking to deal with strikes by making them illegal, rather than negotiate with unions. “PCS members are on strike because they cannot afford the cost of living. We view any attempt to outlaw strikes as an attack on the trade union movement and we will resist that at every stage.” Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said: “This is an empty offer from the Tory government, and a meaningless stunt from Grant Shapps. “Firefighters and other key workers are facing a ‘real-terms’ pay cut, against a backdrop of rising food and fuel prices during the cost-of-living crisis. “Nothing in this statement from Grant Shapps seeks to address the ‘in work’ poverty faced by these workers who kept our public services going during the pandemic. “They were the Covid heroes. “This grandstanding from Grant Shapps is badly misjudging the public mood. “The Government should call off all pay cuts and we’ll call off strikes. “Grant Shapps should stop telling workers to accept falling real wages.” Claire Sullivan, director of employer relations and union services at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Imposing new anti-strike legislation in a country which already has some of the most onerous strike laws in Europe is unnecessary, weak and unworkable. “The Government is well aware that the proposed ‘voluntary agreements’ in the NHS are already in place due to health workers’ commitment to providing ‘critical to life’ cover. “The way for the Government to avoid current and future workplace disputes is through ongoing, meaningful dialogue and by working in partnership with trade unions. The CSP and other health unions have been warning of the developing NHS crisis for a decade and calling for urgent pay talks for several months, only to be met repeatedly by a complete block from Government.”",Government pressing ahead with ‘minimum safety levels’ legislation,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/unions-government-grant-shapps-nhs-prime-minister-b2256705.html

The official government forecasts from HM Treasury show a fall in UK economic output (gross domestic product, GDP) of 0.8 per cent in 2023. The Scottish Fiscal Commission are predicting a 1.2 per cent fall in Scottish economic output. There are no official forecasts for the Highland economy but it is very likely that the GDP performance will be even worse, with probably a fall of about 1.5 per cent. The reasons for that include the greater importance of the tourism industry. Inflation in 2023 is forecast to be about five per cent. That implies an annual fall in personal incomes of about 6.5 per cent in the Highlands. That means another substantial reduction in personal spending, which will have serious negative implications for local shops and other businesses. Looking further ahead, 2024 will almost certainly be better but there can be little doubt that 2023 will be another bad year for the local economy. The world economy had a very bad 2022 because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and an inflation rate exceeding 10 per cent. The huge increase in oil and gas prices has badly affected the output of many industries and also consumer spending. There is little expectation of an improvement until later in 2023, as the above forecasts show. The Highlands have a diversified economy, dominated by the service sector, including tourism in normal years. The manufacturing sector is relatively small but includes important industries such as offshore oil and gas production, renewable energy, Scotch whisky and fish processing. Public sector employment has held up well, because of the importance of bodies such as the Highland Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, NatureScot and the Crofting Commission. However, all their budgets have been under severe pressure and that will continue during 2023. Tourism is very important for many parts of the Highlands. It had a very bad 2022 and unfortunately there are few signs of a significant improvement in 2023. There were big falls in visitor numbers last year because of the various Covid restrictions, which resulted in similar falls in revenue for local hotels, B&Bs and many local shops. Hopefully there will be a revival during 2023. Some industries have done surprisingly well, such as Scotch whisky. New distilleries and expansions are currently under construction in various parts of the Highlands. It is a very strange time for the energy industry in the Highlands, including offshore oil and gas, wind farms and other renewables. Oil and gas production is declining steadily but the recent huge increases in world oil and gas prices have helped existing fields and will possibly lead to a few new developments, despite environmental opposition. In contrast, there has been disappointing progress with renewable energy developments and there are few reasons to expect 2023 to be better. A few local businesses, notably Global Energy at Nigg, are doing very well from wind farm contracts but the overall growth has been much less than predicted. The fishing industry should have a better year because of recent international agreements on fish catches. It and the local fish farms have also benefitted from the rises in consumer prices. Most other local businesses have been badly affected by the huge rises in energy prices. However, world oil and gas prices have fallen significantly in recent weeks. Consumer confidence is low and I expect that to continue during the first half of 2023 at least. The lower consumer spending will have negative impacts for shops and other service sector businesses. More closures seem inevitable. There can be little doubt that the first half of 2023 will be another bad time for the Highland economy. I hope there will be a big improvement during the second half of the year but the current indications are not promising. Tony Mackay is an Inverness-based economist.

Morris Leslie, the company behind the West Kinfauns plans, won planning permission in principle in August. 2022? The proposal is for a four-star, four-storey hotel as well as holiday lodges, transport museum and shops. Cafes, restaurants, bakeries and a cycle repair shops could also form part of the development, which could create up to 130 full-time jobs. Next steps in Perthshire leisure hub Morris Leslie’s group operations director Graham Ogilvie has revealed the next steps for the development. Reflecting on a year of progress, he said: “2022 has all been about getting the consent. 2023 is working through the consent and splitting the development into different parts. “The lodges will be the first part of the development. We will progress with the applying for detailed consent and then construction will commence. “This is something we will do ourselves. In the past 18 months we have created our first holiday park at Alyth. This would also be done under the Morris Leslie Villages banner. “It will be around 50 lodges on site. This part of the project alone would be an investment of around £10 million.” Hotel operator sought Morris Leslie is best known for hiring construction equipment, but also has auction and property interests. It also has its headquarters on the site it acquired from Edrington in 2019. However, the company is not going to be a hotel operator. Armed with the outline planning permission from Perth and Kinross Council it will be marketing the hotel opportunity. “There have been discussions with operators that are ongoing,” Mr Ogilvie said. “Getting the brand is the easier bit, it’s the funding and development of the construction project where there are negotiations and discussions ongoing. “I’d like to think we’ll have an operator on board in 12 months’ time.” He warns that the quoted £33.8 million cost is likely to be far higher due to inflation. “The build costs from when we started the project to where we are now have moved significantly but room rates for hotels have moved higher as well,” he said. The park and ride facility, museum and retail elements of the project are likely to come at the later stages of the development. Neighbouring the site is a new 15-home development by Ogilvie Homes who won permission on appeal to the Scottish Government. Morris Leslie hopes around 80,000 people a year could be attracted to the site, boosting the local economy by £4m.

Comment No one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are The dysfunctional rail system can only be fixed if rail pensions are also sorted out John Ralfe 6 January 2023 • 9:35am 350,000 people are part of the Railways Pension Scheme Credit: Jacob King/PA Wire New Year, new rail strikes, new chaos for rail passengers. Although unions have been locked in a bitter dispute with government and rail companies for months, over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions, we haven’t heard much about pensions. Perhaps this is because no one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are? Pensions for train operating company staff are still based on final salary, and most still have a retirement age of 60. Even public sector pensions are now based on career average salaries, with a higher retirement age. The average salary for a train driver with 10-20 years experience is reported to be £55,000, so a driver retiring at 60 with 30 years pension would get an average inflation-linked pension of £22,000, plus a £33,000 cash lump sum. Train company accounts show the annual cost of new pension promises is around 60pc of salary – a huge part of overall pay – even after employee contributions. Rail pensions have a unique “cost sharing” arrangement, with all regular and deficit cash contributions split 60/40 between employers and employees, which may explain the reluctance to increase annual cash contributions. Each train operating company is part of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), set up at privatisation in 1994. It is an industry-wide scheme with over 100 legally separate sections, including Network Rail, and freight, engineering and maintenance companies. At privatisation, all pensioners and deferred members were transferred to a new section with a “crown guarantee” underwritten by taxpayers. RPS is one of the UK’s largest pension schemes, with £37bn of assets at December 2021, and 350,000 members, including 100,000 current employees. Each RPS section has a three-year valuation but the December 2016 valuation for train operating companies have still not been agreed with the Pensions Regulator, way, way beyond the legal deadline. Although the established rail franchising rules mean train operating companies must pay cash contributions over the life of a franchise, they have no liability for a deficit when the franchise ends. The deficit is simply passed on to the next company taking over the franchise, in a game of pass-the-parcel. If no one is prepared to take on the franchise, it reverts to the Government. The latest accounts for each of the train operating companies show the combined pension deficit is around £8bn. We know the effective re-nationalisation of the train operators in 2020 means all the industry’s annual losses are paid by taxpayers. But re-nationalisation also means taxpayers are on the hook for the pension deficit, which has been hidden from taxpayers. The dysfunctional rail system can only be sorted out if rail pensions are also sorted out. Despite the threat of further strikes, this means closing the expensive and risky defined benefit pension and moving to defined contribution. The good news for rail staff is that some of the cost savings can be used to increase monthly pay. Defined contributions would still leave the £8bn deficit to be paid, partly through higher fares, but with taxpayers left picking up most of the bill.

The British Medical Association (BMA) warned of three days of further disruption for the NHS if health secretary Steve Barclay continues to refuse to negotiate over pay demands. It comes ahead of a ballot opening on 9 January, when 45,000 junior doctors in England will be asked whether they want to strike in the row over pay. The BMA claimed that Mr Barclay was making attempts to find a negotiated settlement impossible by ignoring “all calls and letters” despite the prospect of strike action. “Pay erosion, exhaustion and despair are forcing junior doctors out of the NHS, pushing waiting lists even higher as patients suffer needlessly,” said Dr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Robert Laurenson, co-chairs of the BMA junior doctors committee. They added: “The government’s refusal to address fifteen years of pay erosion has given junior doctors no choice but to ballot for industrial action. If the government won’t fight for our health service, then we will.” The union said successive governments have overseen 15 years of real-term pay cuts for junior doctors, saying it amounted to a “staggering and unjustifiable” 26.1 per cent decline in pay since 2008-09. But the government has awarded only a 2 per cent pay rise for junior doctors, and Mr Barclay has continued to point to the recommendation of the independent pay review body as a reason to avoid negotiations. The BMA said it was “particularly galling” to see Rishi Sunak and his ministers refer to the pay review body. “The reality is that the doctors’ pay review body has been constrained by political interference for more than a decade,” said the union’s co-chairs. The prospect of fresh NHS disruption comes as ambulance staff prepare to walk out on 11 and 23 January, while nurses will strike again for two consecutive days on 18 and 19 January. The government has vowed to press ahead with plans to introduce new legislation to enforce “minimum safety levels” in the NHS and five other key sectors during industrial action. Health unions reacted with fury to the move, saying it would do nothing to resolve the disputes breaking out across the country. The Royal College of Nursing, GMB and Unison – leading the walks-outs planned for nurses and ambulance staff later in January – also vowed to opposed “desperate” anti-strike legislation. The government also urged union leaders to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about public sector pay settlements for 2023-24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged strikes. But unions bosses said ministers must engage on pay demands for the current year, with the GMB health union accusing the government of trying to “kick the can down the road”. The BMA and other health bodies have warned of an “exodus” of NHS staff as industrial dispute rumbles on. Four in ten (40 per cent) of junior doctors plan to leave the health service as soon as they can find another role, a survey carried out by the BMA last month found. Low pay and poor working conditions were the main reasons cited for wanting to leave, with the union warning that the NHS “would not be able to cope” without two-fifths of its junior doctor workforce. It comes after Mr Barclay appeared to blame high numbers of flu, Covid and Strep A cases for the particular pressures the NHS faced over Christmas – a claim refuted by health leaders who pointed to long-term struggles. Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA’s consultants committee, said the government’s refusal to admit that the NHS is in a state crisis was “simply delusional”.",Junior doctors to vote on plans to hold three-day strike in row over pay,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/junior-doctors-strike-nhs-march-b2256855.html

The latest S&P Global/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI), closely watched by the housebuilding sector, scored 48.8 in December, down from 50.4 in November. Any score below 50 indicates that construction sector output has shrunk, and December’s score marks the first contraction since August. It also came in broadly in line with the consensus, with analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics predicting PMI would fall to around 48.5. The sector has suffered the knock-on effects of a slowing housing market, with mortgages becoming more expensive for home buyers resulting in fewer house sales, economists said. Yet construction firms continue to face higher inflation, pushing up the cost of raw materials and transportation, and the looming threat of a recession. As a result, builders are feeling downbeat about the future of their businesses, the survey revealed. December saw confidence among businesses in the outlook for the year drop into negative territory for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and for only the sixth time on record. Dr John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: “The construction sector was stuck in the mud in December with the steepest fall in activity since the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020 and a similarly fast drop in pipelines of new work. “Housebuilding saw a notable change of direction, with a mix of higher inflation for raw materials and transportation and the squeeze on affordability rates for mortgages resulting in fewer house sales.” The commercial sector marked a “bright spot” in the survey, with activity growing fractionally, with a score of 50.3. But it was offset by contractions across the residential and civil engineering sectors in December. Dr Glen added: “Civil engineering, responsible for larger projects, continued to be the weakest performer again, with a sixth month in the doldrums as uncertainty about the UK economy reared its ugly head again and customers hesitated.” Furthermore, the survey suggests that builders are reining back on recruitment amid a hesitancy to spend too much when the future of the economy is uncertain.

Any score below 50 indicates that construction sector output has shrunk, and December’s score marks the first contraction since August. It also came in broadly in line with the consensus, with analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics predicting PMI would fall to around 48.5. The sector has suffered the knock-on effects of a slowing housing market, with mortgages becoming more expensive for home buyers resulting in fewer house sales, economists said. Yet construction firms continue to face higher inflation, pushing up the cost of raw materials and transportation, and the looming threat of a recession. As a result, builders are feeling downbeat about the future of their businesses, the survey revealed. December saw confidence among businesses in the outlook for the year drop into negative territory for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and for only the sixth time on record. Dr John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: “The construction sector was stuck in the mud in December with the steepest fall in activity since the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020 and a similarly fast drop in pipelines of new work. “Housebuilding saw a notable change of direction, with a mix of higher inflation for raw materials and transportation and the squeeze on affordability rates for mortgages resulting in fewer house sales.” The commercial sector marked a “bright spot” in the survey, with activity growing fractionally, with a score of 50.3. But it was offset by contractions across the residential and civil engineering sectors in December. Dr Glen added: “Civil engineering, responsible for larger projects, continued to be the weakest performer again, with a sixth month in the doldrums as uncertainty about the UK economy reared its ugly head again and customers hesitated.” Furthermore, the survey suggests that builders are reining back on recruitment amid a hesitancy to spend too much when the future of the economy is uncertain.

Speaking on a visit to a school in Battersea, south-west London, the Prime Minister said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday.” Pressed whether the talks would include discussions on this year’s pay, the Prime Minister did not rule this out, saying: “What we have said is we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation with all union leaders about what is responsible, what is reasonable, and what is affordable for our country when it comes to pay. “I’m hopeful that those talks can be constructive and we can find a way through this.” Asked whether he could meet the nursing union’s demands “halfway” after it suggested a pay rise of ten per cent rather than nearly double, the PM added: “We have always been clear that we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation, a two way conversation with union leaders.” The Standard understands that the move is a new approach by the Government, with Cabinet ministers, not the PM, meeting the unions that their departments work with, and that the Government aims to talk about pay deals for 2023/24 rather than this year. However, the stand-off between the Government and unions has escalated after ministers proposed bringing in legislation to force some sectors such as health and transport to continue delivering a “minimum service” during industrial action. Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation. Asked a second time whether people could be sacked for not going to work under the new law, the premier said: ""I fully believe in the unions' role in our society and the freedom for them to strike. ""I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption. ""That's why we're going to bring forward new laws, in common with countries like France, Italy, Spain and others, that ensure that we have minimum levels of safety in critical areas like fire, like ambulance, so that even when strikes are going on you know that your health will be protected. ""I think that's entirely reasonable and that's what our new laws will do."" Labour has said it would repeal the “minimum service” laws, if they are passed before the General Election, and if it wins the poll expected next year. Britain is being hit by a wave of strikes including by rail workers, nurses, paramedics, postal workers, border staff and civil servants.","Rishi Sunak invites all union leaders for ‘grown-up, honest’ talks on Monday in bid to end strikes",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/strikes-rishi-sunak-unions-talks-rail-nurses-b1051247.html

The Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure vital public services maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike.

Speaking from the picket line at Euston station on Friday, Mr Lynch told BBC Breakfast that the Government is trying to “close down” the unions with the new legislation. “What this is a symbol of is that the Government are losing the argument,” he said. “They’ve lost the argument on austerity and pay, and the state of our national public services. “And instead they want to close that argument down by closing down the unions and stopping us from campaigning against poverty.” He said the Bill is a threat to sack union members if they refuse to go to work. “What they are saying is that they will sack our members if they don’t go to work,” he said. “They are going to conscript our members. “We have to name who will go to work, and if those members in a lawful manner don’t want to cross our picket line they can be dismissed individually and the union can be fined. “So we will have to see what the law says.” It comes as services have been crippled by the walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) at Network Rail and 14 train operators on Friday. The action will last for 48 hours and follows a stoppage on Thursday by train drivers in the Aslef union which caused widespread disruption.

Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a school in south-west London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had invited union leaders for what he hopes will be a “grown-up” conversation on Monday about what is affordable. The Prime Minister was asked if proposed legislation could see nurses sacked for striking, and if it was his ambition to go further and make some more strikes in critical services illegal. Mr Sunak said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday. “We incredibly value the important work that our public sector workers do, especially our nurses, and we want to have an honest, grown-up conversation about what’s affordable, what’s responsible for the country. “Those invitations have gone out and I’m hopeful that those meetings can happen on Monday so we can have a productive conversation and find a way through this.” Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation.

As many projects were pushed back last year, the beginning of 2023 will be marked by a steady pipeline of work. However, this optimism will be short-lived. Recessionary forces will strike and work is expected to tail off at the back end of 2023. No one feels confident. It is a nervous period to operate as a business, and the sector must stay alert. For the housing market, demand is falling amidst the cost of living crisis, job insecurity and the recession. Declining property prices should stabilise by Spring 2023 yet only those not bound to the difficulties of securing a mortgage or with sufficient savings will be able to afford the luxury of entering the property ladder. The government could help stimulate demand in the housing market by introducing a reduced stamp duty rate for first-time buyers and those wanting to downsize to a smaller property. Confidence in the market will return, but it will take time. Ultimately while the best-run construction companies will survive, partly due to their inherent financial strength, others, including good contractors who may be dependent on third parties, will unfortunately fail. The recession and cost of the living crisis will continue to bite hard. The sector must brace itself for a challenging and uncertain 2023.","UK building sector activity falls, as house prices drop again; eurozone inflation down – business live",https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jan/06/uk-house-prices-fall-us-jobs-eurozone-inflation-train-strikes-business-live

Luke Counter, owner of the multi-award-winning Counter Interiors, which now occupies a new 1,500 sq ft mezzanine showroom, said: “I can’t speak highly enough of the Malton Enterprise Park, which is the perfect base for us. The flexibility of the mezzanine unit which we occupy means that we now have an extensive showroom, storeroom and offices. “We are based in Clifton in York, but quite a few of our customers are from the Malton and Ryedale area, so it made sense for us to open another showroom here. The location, just by the A64, is ideal, with easy access to the rest of the county. The whole park looks magnificent, which creates the perfect atmosphere for businesses here to flourish.” Meanwhile Bella di Notte, the popular women’s fashion retailer, which originally moved to the Malton Enterprise Park four years ago, has recently taken extra space to accommodate its growth.

Just this week, Amazon said it was axing 18,000 workers, or 6% of its office staff, while business software firm Salesforce said it would reduce its workforce by 10%, or roughly 8,000 people. That followed announcements from dozens of other firms including big names such as Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, hardware heavyweight Cisco, and payments firm Stripe. Despite the belt-tightening seen in Silicon Valley, the world's largest economy soldiers on. Employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, according to the latest official figures. Although that was slower than gains seen in 2021, when activity roared back to life after the pandemic, it was still strong by most standards. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, returning to historic lows. The economy is widely predicted to slow in the coming months as rising prices weigh on consumer spending. Firms are also grappling with higher borrowing costs after the US central bank hiked rates rapidly last year. So are the cuts in the tech industry a warning sign for others? ""I don't think people should be worried,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. ""What we're seeing right now seems to be... a correction, not the start of an ominous, systematic recession."" Many tech executives making the announcements have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic, when more activity moved online and business boomed. Funding for smaller start-ups has also dried up due to higher interest rates and the sharp downturn in the US stock market in 2022. Big hits some firms have taken from the meltdown in the crypto sector have not helped the mood either. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM, said the wave of tech cuts represented a ""necessary and expected"" adjustment after a generation of rapid growth, fuelled in part by low interest rates, which culminated in the pandemic frenzy. ""An era of excess has come to an end,"" he said. ""Firms and individuals should be prepared to reset expectations about growth, employment and investment across what continues to be a very solid industry."" He suggested that tech firms will no longer be insulated from ups and downs in the wider economy, including the expected downturns in Europe and the UK this year. But he added that the job losses should not be ""over-interpreted"", noting that many of the workers affected, at least in the US, appear to be finding new jobs quickly. The latest jobs report from the Labor Department showed that payrolls in the information sector - which includes much of the tech industry - shrank by just 5,000 from November to December. That's despite thousands of job cuts being announced in recent months and compared to a year ago, employment is up. ""It's probably a canary in the coal mine for the global economy more than it is for the American economy,"" he added, noting that many of the tech cuts have hit foreign staff. Last week, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that a third of the world would likely be in recession in 2023. That will hurt tech firms, many of which do big business overseas. But for now, the US labour market has remained unexpectedly resilient, making some hopeful that the country will be able to fend off a harsh downturn, despite the central bank raising interest rates to try to cool the economy and price rises. Nearly every sector in the US economy added jobs last month, with bars and restaurants, health care firms and construction businesses helping to drive the gains. Although job losses are rising - especially in sectors vulnerable to higher interest rates like housing, banking and tech - the figures overall remained near historic lows last year, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has been tracking such announcements since the 1990s. ""We are seeing the labour market cooling,"" he says. ""It's a slowdown but I don't think I could say at this point whether or not it's a panic situation."" Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, said he worries many of the layoff announcements reflect peer pressure, as executives feel compelled to copy other firms making cuts - even as they continue to churn out healthy profits. If that sentiment spreads, as he expects, it risks turning the forecasts of economic hardship into reality. ""Companies do what other companies do,"" he said. ""This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because if everybody lays somebody off, the unemployment rate will go up and we will in fact have a worse economy.""",Are tech job cuts a warning for the wider economy?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64189106?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Rebecca Morelle,85546280,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F74F/production/_128211336_virgin-orbit-88.jpg,en,2023-01-07 04:12:22,-0.019,GB,"The first-ever orbital rocket launch from British soil is set to blast off on Monday, marking the start of the UK's race to space. The ambition is to turn the country into a global player in space - from manufacturing satellites, to building rockets and creating new spaceports. But can the UK carve out a place in an increasingly crowded market - and why try to reach for the stars? ""We are the guinea pigs,"" says Melissa Thorpe. ""It is the first time any of us have done this, so it's been quite a learning experience."" Melissa is in charge of Spaceport Cornwall, which is about to attempt its very first foray into space. She's showing me around their base at Newquay Airport. There's all the usual hubbub of activity: passengers arriving, suitcases being loaded, planes being fuelled. But there's also something more surprising on the tarmac: a 21m-long rocket. A team is busy prepping it for the first ever launch from UK soil that will take satellites into orbit around the Earth. But this is a blast off with a difference. There won't be a vertical launch from the ground. Instead, the rocket is fixed underneath the wing of a modified jumbo jet. Once the plane is mid-air, the rocket will be released and fire its engines to head into space. Setting up the UK's first spaceport has taken years and a lot of hard work, plus an entirely new regulatory framework to ensure these launches are safe. The hope is it will make a difference to the local area, one of the poorest in the UK, by bringing in new companies and creating new jobs. ""I think it's the next chapter for Cornwall,"" Melissa says. ""We were at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. We're not new to pioneering technologies."" But there's a wider ambition too. If this succeeds, it should help to position the UK as a leading place for space. However, this isn't the first attempt at creating a British launch industry. A white and red rocket, nicknamed ""the lipstick"", was supposed to be the start of something big for the UK. It blasted off in 1971, sending a satellite into space. The programme was called Black Arrow, and this was the first British-built rocket to deliver a British-built satellite into orbit - although it took off from Australia. But the costs were deemed too high by the government, so that first launch turned out to be the last. The UK's launch industry hit a long pause after this, but another aspect did take off in Britain - satellite building. And this has helped to drive a thriving space sector, which, according to a recent government report, is worth £16.5bn a year to the UK economy and employs nearly 50,000 people. ""We absolutely knock it out of the park when it comes to small satellite manufacture,"" says Dr Alice Bunn, CEO of UKSpace, the trade association of British space companies. Until now, she says, satellites built in the UK have had to be shipped abroad to get into space, but this first launch will change that. And it comes at a time when satellites have become integral to our lives - although Alice says most people are unaware of how dependent we are on this technology. ""Think about satellite navigation systems, environmental monitoring, emergency response - let alone all the telecommunications capability - that we can provide from space. It really is a running thread through our lives,"" she says. And some companies have big plans with this technology. The Cardiff-based company Space Forge thinks a whole host of new materials can be made in orbit. In a cleanroom, one of their small satellites is being painstakingly prepared for its journey. It's one of nine being sent into space by the Cornwall launch. Space Forge describe their shoe box-sized satellites as mini factories. ""In space, with the absence of gravity, you can mix together any different materials you want,"" says Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bacon. ""So if you take the whole periodic table, and start putting things together - like lead, aluminium, rubidium, einsteinium - there are billions of new alloys that you can now make that you couldn't make on Earth."" The new materials could be used in electric vehicles, green technology or computing, he explains. And he thinks there are some big advantages to launching these satellites close to their Welsh base. ''The fact that we can just drive down the road for a couple hours to get to our spaceport is a huge impact,"" Andrew says. But it's not just Cornwall racing to space. Amidst the bleakly beautiful undulating hills and jagged cliffs of the Shetland island of Unst, there's a hive of activity as diggers and dumper trucks come and go. The team here is celebrating because an important milestone has been reached. The concrete is setting on their first launch pad, one of three planned at the site. The SaxaVord Spaceport is being constructed on a peninsula jutting out into the sea, at the northernmost tip of the UK. ""I think the first response from the locals was that maybe it was an April Fool or something like that,"" says Debbie Strang, SaxaVord's chief operating officer. ""And then, as they've seen the progress and the development, there's been real excitement about what we've been doing."" There's a good reason why they've chosen such a remote place, where sheep and Shetland ponies outnumber the inhabitants. ""It's the safety element for us,"" says Debbie. ""What we're doing needs to be as far away as possible from population centres, so that when the rocket leaves, there's no real danger to people nearby."" SaxaVord is aiming for the UK's first vertical rocket launch to take satellites into orbit, with up to 30 launches a year once it's fully up and running. It's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland. Others are planned in Sutherland in the Highlands and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. The hope is that these could all boost local economies, and that's especially important in Unst. ""This island's suffered quite badly from depopulation over the last 20 or 30 years,"" explains Scott Hammond, the deputy CEO of SaxaVord. ""There was a small airfield here that used to be the third busiest heliport in the UK. And then they also had an RAF station here. ""When that left, it halved the population of the island and it clearly had a massive economic impact."" He hopes the spaceport could give the island a boost. ""We'll have more and more service jobs, during the fuelling of the rockets, for example, putting the liquid oxygen into the rockets. And those of course, will be highly paid, highly skilled jobs."" But if you're building a launchpad, you also need rockets - and SaxaVord is working with several companies looking to use Unst to blast off. One of these is Skyrora, based in Cumbernauld, just outside of Glasgow. Inside their vast hanger, the team is busy working on different rocket parts, from nose cones, to engines and containers for propellants. The company is making smaller prototypes, before building a larger rocket, Skyrora XL, that they plan to eventually launch from the Shetland Islands. ""You do a full design on paper and then you start building it. You build prototypes, you do tests, you go back to the drawing board and see what needs to be fixed,"" says Ahsan Zaman. He's just finished his aerospace degree, and says the new push for space in the UK is opening up opportunities for science and engineering graduates. He's proud to be working on the project. ""If we're successful, then we'll forever be known as the first people to do it in the UK. So yeah, it is an honour as well as exciting."" While the launch industry is just starting to come together in the UK, it's much better established in other parts of the world. And one company in particular now dominates the market: Elon Musk's SpaceX. With their reusable rockets, the company has massively cut the price of sending satellites into space. Can the raft of small new rocket companies compete? Skyrora's CEO Volodymyr Levykin says he wants his rockets to offer a more bespoke service. ""We want to be like a satellite taxi service,"" he explains. ""To launch whenever the customer wants us to launch and deliver them to an exact position they need to be in orbit."" He thinks because more and more small satellites are being built, the market to launch them will grow - but not every company will make it. ""Some of us, of course, will fail,"" he says. ""But there are some who are believers in this emerging market. And we decided to invest earlier rather than later, to be ready when the market actually will start to boom."" The UK government says it wants to push the space sector, and is investing in research and development. But UKSpace's Alice Bunn says the support needs to be long term. ""You will not become a global space player by investing in research and development alone. There has to be some kind of government commitment to ongoing operational capability."" She says this could mean the government signing up as a customer for launches, for example. ""We need to think a little bit creatively, industry and government working together, just to get us off the ground here."" All eyes are now on Cornwall, waiting for the first UK launch to blast off. It will be just the start for this new industry and there will be many challenges ahead. But as the well-known mantra goes, space is hard - and anyone working in this sector knows this. The hope is that with this high risk, comes the possibility of sky-high rewards. Follow Rebecca on Twitter.

In a sign of the scale of the problems facing the NHS, Rishi Sunak will spend Saturday focusing on how to ease the pressure on frontline services. But Mr Sunak has been warned that the rare weekend meeting is unlikely to reverse the NHS’ fortunes, which have been blamed on “years of inaction”. Senior doctors say the NHS is on a knife edge, with many A&E units struggling to keep up with demand and trusts and ambulance services declaring critical incidents. Discharge rates fell to a new low in England last week, with only a third of those patients ready to be released from hospital actually leaving. Mr Sunak, during a visit to a school on Friday, said he recognised that the NHS was “under enormous pressure”. No 10’s NHS Recovery Forum will see the Prime Minister hold talks with health experts about how to improve performance. Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Treasury minister John Glen, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden and the chief executive officer of NHS England Amanda Pritchard are also set to attend. The focus will be on four crucial issues: social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care, and primary care. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there were “no silver bullets” to solving the crisis currently being experienced at hospitals and other care centres. “This crisis has been a decade or more in the making and we are now paying the high price for years of inaction and managed decline,” said Mr Taylor. “Patients are experiencing delays that we haven’t seen for years. “High levels of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rising Covid levels are exacerbating the problem but the cause is decades of under-investment in staffing, capital and the lack of a long-term solution to the capacity-crunch facing social care. “None of these problems can be solved tomorrow.” The Prime Minister, in his first speech of 2023 on Wednesday, made reducing NHS waiting lists one of his key pledges before the next election, which is due to take place before 2025. Saturday’s Downing Street forum is expected to last most of the day. As well as ministers, attendees will include chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations, local areas and councils from across the country. Clinical experts from Royal Colleges and independent sector organisations working with health and social care services to deliver services for patients are also expected to join the Prime Minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “As the Prime Minister made clear this week, easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS is one of his key promises. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting branded the meeting a “talking shop”. The senior Labour figure said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor, a former Labour and Tony Blair aide, agreed with the criticism, saying the investment to improve discharge rates came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. He added: “Indeed, some local systems are still awaiting their allocation. “Any similar funding next year must be provided four to six months in advance so it can genuinely ease winter pressures.” On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet with union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year. However, Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen has told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” over the current settlement to prevent planned strikes. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll, of course, go to the meeting and make the case for nursing in all forums, but it’s sadly not what’s going to prevent strike action that’s planned for 10 days’ time. “I have put out an olive branch to get us to the table, I’m asking the Prime Minister now to meet the RCN halfway. The ball is firmly in the Prime Minister’s court.” A Department of Health and Social Care source said the Health Secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”.",Sunak to hold emergency No 10 talks in bid to ease winter care crisis,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/steve-barclay-matthew-taylor-nhs-wes-streeting-prime-minister-b2257731.html

The prime minister told health and social care leaders during an emergency summit in Downing Street on Saturday that it was a “collective responsibility” to free up hospital beds and slash ambulance waiting times. But Ms Cullen said his pledge will fail unless he gives her members a pay rise. She warned Mr Sunak the public would back nurses over the government if any were sacked as part of a new anti-strike crackdown and claimed the upcoming nurses’ walkout will be the biggest strike of its kind in the world. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Cullen also challenged the “out of touch” prime minister and health secretary Steve Barclay to work a 14-hour shift in a crisis-hit emergency ward. She said Mr Sunak could end the strikes this week if he takes up her offer to meet in the middle on pay, after saying she was willing to discuss a raise of 10 per cent instead of the 19 per cent originally asked for. During the crunch summit to solve the chaos engulfing English hospitals, Mr Sunak warned health leaders “business-as-usual mindset won’t fix the challenges we face”. England’s chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty and NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard were among those summoned for the rare weekend meeting. The prime minister is understood to be looking at ideas including the use of technology to help people stay out of hospital and increasing the number of “virtual wards”. He also highlighted that a small number of NHS trusts were responsible for a large proportion of serious issues, including long ambulance waits and waiting times for cancer care. Downing Street has said it will publish recovery plans to improve ambulance and A&E waiting times “in the coming weeks”. As Mr Sunak battles to bring the current crisis under control, Ms Cullen urged him to understand the scale of the upcoming nurses’ strike. A 48-hour walkout in England from 18 January will involve more hospitals than similar strikes last month’s action. She said: “We balloted around 320,000 nursing staff and my understanding is it has been the largest ballot of nursing staff in the world and it is the largest nursing strike in the world. We’ve also increased the number of organisations [such as NHS Trusts]. There are now 70 involved. First time around it was 46.” She also revealed that she had received messages of support from senior politicians in several European countries. December’s strikes were headline news in France, Italy, Spain and Austria among others. The world was “watching in dismay”, Ms Cullen said. She urged Mr Sunak to learn from the experience of other international leaders who were forced to back down in the face of ward walkouts, including Irish prime ministers in the first decade of this century. “What this government should look to is how the leader of [Ireland] stepped in very quickly and did not allow both of those strikes to go beyond the first few days,” she said. “And took immediate action. And that was because the public pressure was enormous.” On Wednesday, Mr Sunak set out his vision for the NHS, including a personal pledge to cut waiting lists. But he was criticised for offering nothing to end the current crisis or the strikes, which will also see ambulance staff take action later this month. “He made a broad, bold statement that he was going to cut waiting lists, but he won’t unless he addresses the crisis in nursing ... and the only way you are going to do that is to address the fundamental issue of nurses’ pay,” Ms Cullen said. Strike action will have to escalate if the government continues to ignore nurses, she said, although no decisions have yet been taken on what that would look like. Ms Cullen added: “He could bring it to a resolution this coming week – and avert industrial action. I will make myself available any night or any day. Let’s get round a table. Let’s have a discussion. “I think they owe that to the profession, to all those 320,000 nurses. And they owe it to every patient in this country, particularly those 7.2 million sitting on waiting lists year on year, to get around a table.” On Friday Mr Sunak refused to rule out that nurses could be sacked as part of his new crackdown, swerving the question in a broadcast interview. She described “any suggestion that they would sack any nurse… simply because nurses are standing up for their patients and the NHS” as “disheartening” given that there were currently 47,000 vacancies in the UK. Describing the prime minister as “out of touch” with the realities of the current crisis, she challenged Mr Sunak and his health secretary to work a 14-hour shift in an emergency department. She said: “From 7am to late into the evening, when a number of those hours will be unpaid, when the nurses should be off shift and home but they have no one to hand their patients on to. “They need to just walk in the shoes of those nurses for a few of those shifts. And I think that would make better decisions.” Leaving the NHS Recovery Forum on Saturday, consultant physician James Dunbar told reporters he was “confident that action will be taken” to address the crisis – but not optimistic it would be dealt with before spring. “These are difficult problems to fix though, so I think it’s unlikely we’ll have it sorted by the end of this winter,” he said. Dr Dunbar said that “a lot of” senior clinical leaders taking part were “saying the same thing”, adding: “The prime minister seemed to understand that.” Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Adrian Boyle meanwhile said the crisis is “fixable” and welcomed emergency care being “recognised as a priority”. A Downing Street spokesperson said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she added. A Department of Health and Social Care source said the health secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”. A government spokesperson said: “The health and social care secretary wants to have an honest conversation with unions, including the RCN, about what is affordable in pay settlements for next year during these challenging times, and is keen to meet for discussions as soon as possible. “We have accepted the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in full and have given over 1 million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. This is on top of a 3 per cent pay increase last year when public sector pay was frozen and wider government support with the cost of living.”",Rishi Sunak warned waiting list pledge will fail without NHS pay rise as he calls for ‘radical’ action,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/pat-cullen-nurses-rcn-strikes-b2257639.html

Here, we speak to just three of them. Volunteers at a vital community foodbank say that demand is surging with low-paid workers increasing reliant on it to make ends meet, writes Russell Blackstock. The facility at St Gregory’s Catholic Church, in Wyndford, Glasgow, is staffed entirely by unpaid helpers and is open five days a week. Unlike other foodbanks, St Gregory’s does not require users to provide a referral from an agency. It distributes free bags comprising up to 20 items including cereal, pasta, canned soup, tuna, tinned fruit, long-life milk and eggs. Toiletries, washing powder and washing-up liquid are also available. Co-ordinator Eileen Low said the number of people seeking help had soared by more than 30% since the pandemic’s peak while in the week before Christmas volunteers distributed a record number of bags. “We have just had our biggest ever week with 219 basic bags being handed out to help more than 500 individuals and families,” she said. “It is a grim new record to end the year with for us.” Low said that the foodbank’s clientele had also changed since the cost of living crisis started to bite this winter and many more working families were now seeking help. “When we started out five years ago, we were distributing between 30 and 40 bags weekly and it was usually to the most vulnerable people such as refugees, single pensioners and those with mental health or addiction issues,” she explained. “But now we are seeing more and more parents who have low-paid jobs such as cleaners and hospitality workers coming to us for help because they can’t pay the bills and feed their kids at the same time. “The working poor is a growing sector in our area and the government seems unable to do something constructive about it, so that’s where community-based charities come in. We are another safety net for people who are struggling financially and the authorities seem happy to let the likes of us pick up the slack. “It is obscene that this is happening in this day in age. At times we feel as though we are providing a new frontline service.” Ingrid Mitchell, who lives locally, has been volunteering at St Gregory’s for the past three years. She helps to shop for staples and hands out and delivers bags to foodbank users. The mother of two is a senior cabin crew member with a large airline, serving meals and drinks to passengers on transatlantic routes. She has been shocked by the surge in families seeking assistance from the foodbank. She said: “Many people feel embarrassed to ask for help but some have no other choice and they now rely on us. I have always been community minded and it is awful to see ordinary people in this situation. Sadly, I can’t see this crisis easing any time soon.” ‘We are warm and can offer a respite to what is going on’ No longer just a place to borrow books or study for exams, libraries are introducing a range of activities, clubs and groups to create “warm and welcoming spaces” that people can utilise during the cost of living crisis, writes Alice Hinds. From movie matinees and craft groups to mindful colouring-in sessions for adults and regular coffee mornings, library leaders say such innovative services provide a vital lifeline for people in the community who would otherwise struggle to find warm, comfortable and, importantly, free places to spend time during winter months. Ray Pattie, library adviser at Edinburgh Central Library, says the centres have always provided support for communities but new groups have become increasingly popular for people who may feel isolated or worried about spending money while socialising. “Our users see libraries as safe and reliable spaces,” he explained. “People just don’t have the disposable income now for sitting in Costa for hours and hours – that can turn into an expensive week, so they are looking for other things to do outside of the home. “That’s why we’re providing things like Knit And Natter, a weekly craft group, and adult colouring-in sessions, too. “The activities give people an opportunity to still come out and spend time with other people in a warm space but it’s more affordable than visiting a cafe. It’s an opportunity to meet new people as well. Since I’ve worked in libraries, it has very much been all about the community.” As well as introducing social groups, many of the Scottish capital’s libraries have also added social spaces to encourage people to visit for as long as they like. Replicating a living room with plants, comfortable seating, warm lighting and coffee tables, the areas also have free-to-use jigsaws and board games and a number of libraries have also included self-help guides on topics such as energy and money saving, and cooking on a budget. Hana Mackechnie, lifelong learning service manager for libraries in Edinburgh, said: “Some of our libraries are open 52 hours a week and you don’t need to come for a particular reason. “We’re finding that people want a space where they can spend a little bit longer, and somewhere they can also find signposting to benefits they might be entitled to, or get advice on how to access particular services. If you are a reader, you probably already feel like you’re welcome in a library but there’s so much more going on and we’re trying to introduce more activities.” Every weekday during winter, libraries across Edinburgh are also hosting movie matinees with free teas, coffees and refreshments, giving people another way to keep warm for a few hours. Acting library supervisor Natasha Gibson added: “We were already providing or about to introduce these initiatives but the situation now has brought more of a need for them and highlighted just how valuable they are for the community. “People are becoming more aware that, yes, libraries are also a place to come and be social and have a few minutes of respite from whatever is going on in life. “People do come to the library specifically to chat to people or get a change of scenery and at the moment it’s a much-needed place away from home that’s warm – both in terms of the physical surroundings and the people that are here.” ‘It is sad to see so many people struggling’ Demand for free furniture, school uniforms and even haircuts is on the rise at a community-based initiative in south-west Scotland, writes Russell Blackstock. The Furniture Project in Stranraer was originally set up to recycle, repair and provide refurbished household goods at affordable prices. But the charity, which has more than 20 volunteers and runs two shops, has also turned to providing household items and services for free to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. “We started running Freebie Friday events that are proving to be hugely popular,” said boss Paul Smith. “These include giving away items like furniture and household appliances and demand has been high. “So many low-income workers who wouldn’t normally be struggling are now coming to us because the price of everything has risen so much that they simply can’t make ends meet. “I suppose we are doing what the likes of parish organisations and local authorities might have done in the past.” Other popular services provided by the charity include organising free school uniforms and haircuts for children whose parents are struggling to get by. “A new school blazer alone can cost between £40 and £50 and if you have three kids in the house, that is a big expense for any family,” said Smith. “People can come to our shop and discreetly get a school uniform for nothing, and we run this service all through the school year. We have also started a project involving local hairdressers so that kids can get haircuts for free because, again, this can be expensive if you have a number of children in the house. “We try to help to make sure that these kids don’t feel any different from friends at school who come from better-off backgrounds. “It is sad to see so many people struggling financially at the moment but I grew up on a housing scheme that was regarded as being poor and we had to put up with hand-me-downs, so I know what that is like.” The organisation also recycles bicycles and gifts that would usually go to landfill, and sells them cheaply to people once they have been refurbished. Also, it provides a mentoring service that enables retired people to pass on skills and knowledge to youngsters so that they can find jobs in areas such as warehousing and customer services. Smith said even middle-income families were now using the project to inexpensively replace big-ticket household items such as fridges, cookers and furniture as the cost of living crisis deepens. He added: “Previously, you could almost categorise those using services like ours as being among the most vulnerable in our community but the financial pressures are now adding up for people right across the board. “We are now increasingly helping the sort of folk that we normally wouldn’t expect to see.”","Community foodbank: In this day and age, it is obscene we are so needed as a safety net for people",https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/foodbanks-warmbanks/

Being the prime minister, he must have thought, has to amount to more than acknowledging a terrifying array of looming crises. When asked what you hope to do with your time in office, you’ve got to give a more inspiring answer than “cope”, even if you’re fortunate in following a leader who didn’t even manage that. What would be a clear, constructive, positive, yet achievable, initiative? Nothing fun at this bleak time – any whiff of levity could be accused of trivialising people’s suffering. And nothing that sounds expensive. Also nothing that sounds too leftwing, what with the Tory right calling Sunak a socialist for failing to cut taxes. But nothing that sounds too rightwing either, what with the Labour party being so far ahead in the polls. Plus there are many subject areas to avoid: health, transport, defence, the economy… Probably best if it doesn’t touch on any other countries, what with Brexit being such a sore point and China getting horribler and Russia obviously. And there’s the whole illegal immigration shitstorm, so maybe steer clear of abroad altogether. Also food and fuel and housing would be good areas not to mention. Plus it shouldn’t be something that sounds difficult or people won’t believe it’s going to happen. And it shouldn’t be anything that anyone cares too much about because, its achievability notwithstanding, it still probably won’t happen. What should it be? I’d have been stumped. My best idea was: “Every hard-working family will be given a free cactus.” They could sit on kitchen tables, as symbols of bristly resilience, while people try to work out how to pay the mortgages on their freezing homes. Little green shoots of spiny recovery sprouting all over an economic wasteland. Sunak went another way. He fell back on something he could rely on, the solace of many a swot in the face of moral complexity, myself included: maths. You know where you are with maths. Maths doesn’t let you down. Maths doesn’t go on strike, or arrive uninvited on the south coast, or die because it couldn’t get an ambulance, or send bullying texts, or appear on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. Let’s do more maths! That was his new initiative. Everyone should be studying maths until the age of 18, he declared. Who can argue with that? Eight million adults in the UK are only numerate to primary school level. That’s bad. But brilliantly, all those potential voters, who presumably hate maths, won’t have to do any at all, but only agree with the principle that they should have done more previously. No one who can vote will have to do anything they don’t want to. This is an entirely inoffensive policy. The education secretary, who my investigations tell me is called Gillian Keegan, might feel aggrieved that it doesn’t leave her with much to say in her next speech. Michael Gove used to have great fun with that brief – handing out bibles and making everyone read Thomas Hardy and memorise dates – and even Gavin Williamson got to cancel everyone’s exams. The importance of maths should be something Keegan gets to bang on about to easy applause, but the PM has nicked it because every single other policy area has gone toxic. But he was determined to make it sound massive: “This is personal for me,” it was reported that he was “expected to say” in his speech. And he did! “It’s the single most important reason why I came into politics: to give every child the highest possible standard of education.” Wow – it turns out he’s a stealth educationist. He was also expected to say: “Just half of all 16-19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills is letting our children down.” Admirable sentiments, though the phrase “our children’s jobs” raises the spectre of child labour. An unfortunate slip when families are struggling to afford food and fuel and the sick are left untreated. It’s all getting a bit Dickensian. But perhaps it’s deliberate. Is this heritage austerity? Back to when Britain was great? Perhaps by “studying maths” he means “doing data entry”? Good work for children with their nimble fingers, and much safer than picking fluff out of an industrial loom, so we must count our blessings. It was a slip because, of all the things he was “expected to say”, the phrase about “children’s jobs” was the only one he didn’t. Very wise. Bless him, he just wanted to say “children” as many times as possible. A focus group must have generated that finding: saying “children” is a good look for him. Better than for Truss the malfunctioning robot or Johnson the philanderer, who just kept having children. Sunak’s children look nice – he’s shared some lovely photos – it’s a relatable family unit. Keep saying “children”, Rishi, and people will believe you care. I approve of the maths plan, but it’s such a tiny thought. In most countries that we increasingly laughably consider our equivalents, maths up to the age of 18 has long been compulsory. Rather than having an idea, he’s just picked one of myriad ways in which Britain is worse than elsewhere and resolved to correct it. It’s like saying: “We really ought to start brushing our teeth.” A small, long-overdue correction to our educational practices coming from the leader of a party that’s been in power for 12 years. It’s lame. And it won’t happen. Sunak says he “will work with the sector to move towards all children studying some form of maths to 18”. “Work with” to “move towards”. Christ. Don’t hold your breath. As Keegan’s shadow, Bridget Phillipson, put it: “He cannot deliver this reheated, empty pledge without more maths teachers, yet the government has missed their target for new maths teachers year after year.” More teachers requires more money. The money must either be raised or moved from elsewhere. That means fewer missiles or nurses or tax cuts or more taxes. Perhaps maths will let him down after all.",More maths?

RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Today I want to see the Government stop play-acting because the truth, written in black and white in their rail contracts, is that they’ve been in complete control of this dispute from day one. “The train operators cannot move without Government say-so. “Passengers, workers and businesses are suffering and even rail company managers are beginning to break ranks in despair at the Government’s approach. “The minister cannot hide behind this fairy story that he is just a facilitator. “His Government can end this dispute today by taking out the conditions they put in to torpedo a resolution and let the companies make a deal.” Meanwhile, Aslef leaders will consider an offer – made on Friday by the Rail Delivery Group on behalf of train operators – of a 4% pay rise for last year and 4% this year. Conditions were attached to the offer, such as speeding up the training of drivers, as well as over Sunday working arrangements. Rail union and industry officials will give evidence to the Transport Select Committee on Wednesday. A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The Transport Secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. “They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. “Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation and costing every household an extra £1,000.”",Union leaders to meet rail minister in bid to secure deal to end strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-mark-harper-mick-lynch-huw-merriman-rmt-b2258343.html

Last year was chaotic for domestic politics, with upheaval at Westminster and long-running argument at Holyrood on the constitution. Here are just five of the big problems and promises you want sorted for 2023. 1. Fix the NHS NHS Grampian took the desperate step of putting out an urgent social media appeal for staff off-duty or on holiday to come in to work over the festive period. And NHS Highland has warned Raigmore and Belford Hospitals are “very busy” and expressed concerns over a surge in flu patients. Patients across the north and north-east have also struggled to access their GP with one Aberdeen doctor revealing he is seeing three times the safe number of patients “on an almost-daily basis”. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf is facing mounting pressure to come forward with a recovery plan. He says Covid backlogs, rising cases of flu and Strep A, delayed discharged and cold weather are “all compounding” the usual pressures on the health service. The SNP minister is expected to deliver a statement addressing concerns at Holyrood on Tuesday. Meanwhile, NHS Grampian is waiting for an extra £7 million a year required to help more Moray women give birth in Elgin. Campaigners in Caithness continue to raise concerns over the lack of women’s healthcare in the county, with women facing 100-mile journeys to Inverness for treatment. 2. Will the A9 and A96 be dualled? It was confirmed just days before Christmas that a final decision on fully dualling the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness will not be made until well into next year. The SNP promised over a decade ago to dual the route by 2030. But this was thrown into doubt when the Scottish Greens were brought into government in 2021. An open survey of P&J readers, published on January 6, revealed the vast majority of respondents want the A96 dualled all the way. A project to dual the A9 between Inverness and Perth has also been hit by serious delays but the government has yet to give an update on its 2025 target completion date. Pressure on the SNP Government is intensifying after 13 people died on the stretch due to be dualled between the two cities. 3. We need better ferries Furious islanders from the Hebrides to Shetland have warned locals are packing up and quitting their communities in response to the “utterly chaotic” ferry system. The construction of two new ferries, MV Glen Sannox and Hull 802, is well behind schedule and over budget. The vessels, which were originally commissioned in 2015 from struggling shipyard Fergus Marine, are now years late and over a hundred million pounds over budget. The Holyrood inquiry continues but already the SNP is promising more. 4. Whatever happened to Freeports? Three locations across the north-east, Highlands and islands are vying for “green freeport” status from the UK and Scottish governments. Freeports get special tax status and are being promoted as job-creating goldmines. Others fear they are light on regulation and attractive to money launderers. A joint bid by Aberdeen and Peterhead ports is going up against bids by Cromarty Firth and Orkney for the two coveted spots. But bidders have been left in the dark since the summer over who will secure the special tax status, with Scottish Secretary Alister Jack admitting months ago that a decision has already been made. It is understood the ever-changing leadership of the Tory party delayed the announcement last year. 5. What is the future for oil and gas? The SNP conference in October seemed to finally push the future of oil and gas workers to the top of the agenda. Taking place in Aberdeen, Ms Sturgeon said her government has a “duty” to support workers into new green jobs. But there has been a lack of detail on the practicalities. Energy Secretary Michael Matheson is slated to deliver a statement on Scotland’s long-awaited energy strategy and “just transition” plan on Tuesday. The latter will focus on the offshore workforce, Mr Matheson told the Press and Journal last year. Energy policy is reserved to the UK Government and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will have a key role in charting the future of the oil and gas sector, from the licensing of future oil fields to the windfall tax.",5 problems people across the north of Scotland want politicians to fix in 2023,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/5243446/nhs-freeports-a9-a96-oil-gas-ferries/

The deck machinery specialist – based at Towie Barclay Works, near Turriff – is enjoying growth in the offshore floating wind market. Our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Alfie Cheyne, founder and chairman, Ace Winches. Growing demand in energy markets in both North America and the Middle East are also driving the business forward, it said. Ace Winches, whose many accolades over the years include prestigious Queen’s Awards in 2010 and 2013, has formed a subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates as part of its global growth strategy. And earlier this year it announced the opening of a subsidiary in Houston, Texas. Underlying earnings up 38% Chairman Alfie Cheyne said a strong financial performance during the 12 months to March 31 last year was a foundation “which bodes well for the future”. The company reported pre-tax profits of £4.5 million – down from £7.8m for the previous year, when results were boosted by the reversal of a £4.8m write-down. Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation raced ahead to £7.6m last year, up by 38% from £5.5m previously. Ownership tussle The most recent figure excludes one-off costs associated with a change of ownership, Turnover increased slightly to £28.3m, up from just shy of £28m the year before. Ace Winches’ 58-year-old chairman founded the business in 1992 but lost control of it to Balmoral Group in stages between 2017 and 2019. The relationship with Aberdeen-based Balmoral eventually turned sour and Mr Cheyne and his wife, Valerie, reacquired the firm in late 2021. Reflecting on 2021-22, Mr Cheyne said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. “It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is.” He added: “In this reporting period we have made an additional investment of £1.3m in our rental fleet in line with our twin objectives of diversification and geographic expansion. “It has been a year marked by significant growth and change – growth in the renewables market and a change in how we interact with our customers. “This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet, thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Green ambitions Mr Cheyne also highlighted the firm’s green credentials after it became carbon neutral. Operations at Towie Barclay Works are now powered by wind. On the firm’s wider green ambitions, chief commercial officer Gary Wilson said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East are indicators of our strategy going forward.” With more than 3,000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, Ace Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and other services in multiple sectors. Headcount averaged 155 during the 12 months to March 2022, down from 171 the year before. Mrs Cheyne, chief compliance officer, said the company was growing its workforce again. She added: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our graduate engineer numbers, providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.”",Ace Winches sets sights on global growth after &#8216;strong&#8217; results,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/local/5245423/ace-winches-sets-sights-on-global-growth-after-strong-results/

Earlier, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “happy to talk about pay” with unions as ministers held a series of meetings aimed at ending a wave of industrial unrest in the NHS and on the rail network. However, both the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” Unite said any suggestion that a one-off pay reward could be made in exchange for a boost in productivity was “absolutely ludicrous”. While other trade unions said that “progress” had been made, there was no sign that enough had been made for planned strikes to be called off. Unite negotiator Onay Kasab, speaking after a meeting with Mr Barclay, accused the Government of telling staff they would need to “justify” a payment through productivity. “This isn’t a factory we’re talking about, we’re talking about people who are working well beyond their contracted hours anyway just to get the job done because they care so much. “So, for the Government to be talking about productivity in exchange for a (payment) is an insult to every single one of our members.” Mr Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. Alongside talks with health unions, teaching unions were holding talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan ahead of announcements this week over whether their members will go on strike. Rail minister Huw Merriman called in train workers after sustained action crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Mr Kasab said: “I emphasise the thing to get out of today that is absolutely clear is that they want our members to give more in order for it to consider a payment. That is absolutely outrageous.” He said there had been no “detailed” discussion of what a pay settlement might look like, adding that the talks had left him “very angry”. He added: “The Government have missed yet another opportunity. We came here in good faith.” After the meeting, the GMB said that ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday, adding that the talks “fell well short” of anything needed to stop the walk-out. More than 10,000 GMB members are expected by the trade union to take to picket lines on Wednesday. “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis,” said Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary. “The public expects the Government to treat these talks seriously – it’s time they got on with it.” Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, told reporters that “progress” had been made but said there had been no “tangible” concessions. “It was a very civil meeting. We did actually manage to talk about pay – we didn’t get the tangible concessions that we might have hoped for that would enable us to call off the strikes later this week. “But it was definitely progress when you’re in a room with the Secretary of State talking about pay, I think. “He’s asked for our help to help with the Treasury to make the case for investment. We’ll certainly do that.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks. Elaine Sparkes, assistant director at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Although the meeting was more constructive this time, there is nothing tangible on the table. “As such, we’ll be announcing the first of our strike dates later this week as we continue to push for a fairer deal for our members and their colleagues.” The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement. On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”. “On pay, we’ve always said that the Government is happy to talk about pay demands and pay issues that are anchored in what’s reasonable, what’s responsible, what’s affordable for the country.” Downing Street earlier warned that concerns about inflation had not gone away as the Government prepares for the next round of pay talks for 2023/24. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Government was open to listening to trade unions’ concerns. “We are happy to listen to the pressures they think they are under, what they think is fair, responsible and affordable, and likewise we will provide detail about what we think is affordable, and also the challenge that inflation poses to all of this as well.” Elsewhere, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch dodged questions about progress in rail talks but said that further discussions would take place. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, gave a shrugging gesture as he left the Department for Transport but also declined to give any detail of the meeting. The National Education Union said that “no concrete progress” had been made in its talks with the education secretary. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “While there is the thought of further meetings, there is no sense of concrete progress as yet. There is no offer, there is no change. “There are further discussions to happen that we will engage in while still urging our members to vote in the ballot.” Mr Courtney added: “There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action because we think these meetings are only happening because of the threat of industrial action.” Business Secretary Grant Shapps has said ministers were seeking a more “collaborative approach”, telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “It is a new year. We are very keen to see these strikes come to a conclusion. We want to see a collaborative approach.”",Strikes set to go ahead after ‘insulting’ talks with Health Secretary,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/strikes-set-to-go-ahead-after-insulting-talks-with-health-secretary-b2258736.html

The company, which earlier this year announced the opening of ACE Winches Inc. in Houston, Texas, reported a pre-tax profit of £4.5m, while there was also a slight increase in turnover to £28.3m. ACE Winches Chairman Alfie Cheyne, who, in 2021, returned to the organisation he founded, said the performance gives the company a strong platform to build from. He said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone.

As part of that ambition, ACE has formed a subsidiary company in the United Arab Emirates, ensuring the range of high-quality services from concept design through to manufacture, equipment rental and further support, is delivered globally. Chief Commercial Officer Gary Wilson​ said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East, are indicators of our strategy going forward, as we place a focus on areas of opportunity where our capabilities and solutions single us out as a contractor of choice. “We have a strong reputation that has been built up through our commitment to innovation and investing in our people and services over the last 30 years, and we are looking forward to bringing that expertise to more of our customers in North America and the Middle East, as well as markets we already serve.” With more than 3000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, ACE Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and deploying solutions across multiple sectors.

The Jamesfield development is a joint venture with Harmony Energy, following TagEnergy’s acquisition of a 60% stake in the project in November 2021. It will use a system of Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries, together with Tesla’s Autobidder software for real-time trading and control. It is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter this year, with renewable energy company RES as asset manager. Franck Woitiez, chief executive of TagEnergy, said the company's third battery energy storage facility in the UK reinforced its commitment to the country and its green energy goals. “This is another important milestone in TagEnergy’s growth in the UK as we leverage our strong storage expertise to support the UK grid and propel the nation to net-zero carbon emissions by connecting more competitive renewable power. “We are excited to enter this next phase in the project in partnership with Harmony Energy and with the support of Santander UK as we grow our UK footprint to accelerate the energy transition.” Mark Cumbo, director of specialised and project finance at Santander UK, said: “This follows the funding we provided TagEnergy in 2021 to support Hawkers Hill Energy Park in Dorset, and to TagEnergy and Harmony Energy in 2022 for Chapel Farm near Luton. “Santander UK strongly supports clients such as TagEnergy and Harmony Energy that are bringing additional capacity to enable greater contribution from renewables to the UK’s energy sector.” Peter Kavanagh, chief executive of Harmony Energy, said: “We have been working on this site for over four years and are delighted to be progressing to this next stage with TagEnergy, following our partnership which was announced in 2021. “Securing debt funding from Santander UK demonstrates a growing appetite from institutions to support battery developments and we look forward to working with it.” Jamesfield is the third TagEnergy investment in battery storage facilities in the UK to reach financial close following its entry into the UK market in 2021. Commissioning of its first project, Hawkers Hill Energy Park, took place in September and construction of its second project, Chapel Farm, started last February. Jamesfield, Chapel Farm and Hawkers Hill, together with previously-announced projects Roaring Hill in Fife, Lakeside in North Yorkshire and more recently, Pitkevy in Scotland, take TagEnergy’s secured portfolio in the UK to date to 320MW/640MWh. TagEnergy partnered with Balance Power in October to build, own, and operate 500MW of Balance Power’s renewable energy pipeline requiring an investment of more than £300m over the next four years. Since its formation in 2019, TagEnergy has assembled a portfolio of close to 4GW based on solar, wind and battery storage technologies in the UK, Portugal, Spain, France and Australia.

The Health Secretary suggested that improvements in efficiency and productivity could “unlock additional funding” for the 2023/24 pay settlement, but unions want workers paid more now, raising the possibility of a one-off lump sum to help with the soaring cost of living.

In the Commons, Mr Barclay told MPs: “It is right that we are engaging with the trade unions, I was pleased to meet the staff council of the NHS today and indeed the chair of the NHS Staff Council, Sara Gorton, said the discussions had made progress. “Notwithstanding one trade union leader who wasn’t in the talks giving an interview outside the department to comment on what had and had not been said in those talks, but we want to work constructively with the trade unions on that.” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation.

It follows recent articles on inflation, energy, food and the cost of living. Canada: assertive unions getting results Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Canada’s trade union movement is among the more resilient in the OECD, the club of developed countries. This is related to laws that prevent “free riding”, which is where workers can benefit from collective agreements without being union members. Union density in Canada has been around 30% of workers since the turn of the century, although membership in the private sector is barely half that and slowly falling. In contrast, unionisation is high in public services (over 75%) and growing. This relatively stability has left Canadian workers better prepared to confront the impact of inflation on their wages. Unions made higher wage demands than in recent decades, and more frequently went on strike (continuing a trend from 2021). From January to October 2022, there were 145 strikes, and the final year tally will likely exceed the 161 in 2021 – itself a marked increase. A total of 1.9 million person-days of work were lost in strikes up to October (the highest in 15 years). Unlike in recent years, the majority were in the private sector. A spring wave of strikes in construction in Ontario (Canada’s most populous province) symbolised the increased militancy. At peak, over 40,000 workers downed tools for higher wages, including carpenters, dry-wallers and engineers. Tentative agreements reached by officials were sometimes rejected by members, prolonging the strikes. A second historic flash point came later in the year when Ontario’s right-wing government invoked a rarely used constitutional clause to override the right to strike for 55,000 education support workers. After unions in the public and private sector threatened a province-wide general strike, the government backed down. Meanwhile, employer lockouts have virtually disappeared. This tactic, in which employers suspend operations until workers agree to terms being offered, had only been used eight times by October, compared to 60 per year a decade ago. Annual wage growth increased modestly to an average of 5% by late in the year. That still lagged the 6.8% inflation, but closed the gap from 2021. It remains to be seen whether this union pressure can be sustained in the face of rapid interest rate increases, a likely recession in 2023, and continued government suppression of union rights in some provinces. United Kingdom: an olive branch for the health service? Phil Tomlinson, Professor of Industrial Strategy, University of Bath The UK’s latest winter of discontent is extending into 2023 as the country endures its largest wave of strikes in over 30 years. Most are in the public sector, where pay offers are well below inflation and significantly lag private companies. The sense of grievance is high following the austerity and real-terms pay cuts of the 2010s. Strikes – estimated to have cost the UK economy £1.7 billion in 2022 – are being co-ordinated across different unions, adding to the public inconvenience. The UK government has steadfastly refused to yield, however. It has hidden behind independent recommendations by public-sector pay review bodies, despite not always following them. They have also claimed that inflation matching public sector pay rises would cost each UK household an extra £1,000 a year, though this figure has been debunked. The Treasury also echoes Bank of England concerns about setting off a wage-price spiral. Yet this is unlikely, given the current inflation is largely down to supply shocks (from COVID and the war in Ukraine), while average wage growth is well below inflation. There is an economic case for a generous deal, especially in the National Health Service (NHS): with over 133,000 unfilled vacancies, better wages might help improve staff retention and recruitment. Of course, funding this in a recession involves tough choices. Higher taxes would be politically difficult with the tax burden at a 70-year high. Higher government borrowing could aggravate inflation if accommodated by the Bank of England increasing the money supply through more quantitative easing. Public opinion appears largely sympathetic to the strikes, especially in the NHS. But if the government relents in one sector, it sets a precedent for others, with potentially wider economic consequences. For the NHS, it may instead bring forward public sector pay review body negotiations for 2023 to allow for an improved deal – possibly alongside a one-off hardship payment. Elsewhere it will probably hold firm and hope the trade unions lose their resolve. Australia and New Zealand: strikes remain rare despite inflation Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Strikes in Australia have become very rare in recent decades, thanks to restrictive labour laws passed since the 1990s. Despite historically low unemployment and wages lagging far behind inflation, these laws continue to short-circuit most industrial action. In 2022, union density fell to 12.5% of employees, an all-time low. As recently as 1990, union density was over 50% of workers. Union members can legally strike only after negotiations, ballots and specific plans for action have been publicly divulged (thus fully revealing union strategy to the employer). Even when there are strikes, they tend to be short. A total of 182 industrial disputes occurred in the year to September. (The statistics don’t distinguish between strikes and employer lockouts, which have become common in Australia.) This is similar to the pre-COVID years, following a drop in 2020, and only a fraction of 1970s and 1980s industrial action. The only visible increase in strike action in 2022 was a series of one-day protest strikes organised by teachers and health care workers in New South Wales, the country’s most populous state. Having put up with a decade of austere wage caps by the conservative state government, they decided they had had enough as inflation picked up. Most other workers have been passive despite Australia experiencing among the slowest wage growth of any major industrial country. Nominal wages grew just 2% per year over the decade to 2021. That rose to 3.1% by late 2022, but it’s still less than half the 7.3% inflation rate. Australia’s newly elected Labor government did pass a series of important labour law reforms at the end of 2022, aimed at strengthening collective bargaining and wage growth. That might herald incremental improvement in workers’ bargaining power in the years ahead. The industrial relations outlook in New Zealand is somewhat more hospitable for workers and their unions. Union density increased in 2021, to 17% of employees (from 14% in 2020). Average ordinary hourly earnings grew an impressive 7.4% in the latest 12-month period – helped by a 6% boost in the minimum wage by New Zealand’s Labour government. Industrial action remains rare – perhaps in part because workers are successfully lifting wages via other means. No official strike data is available for 2022, but in 2021, just 20 work stoppages occurred, down sharply from an average of 140 per year in the previous three years. Indonesia: anger against labour law reforms Nabiyla Risfa Izzati, Lecturer of Labour Law, Universitas Gadjah Mada A few weeks ago, the government replaced its controversial “omnibus law” with new emergency regulation. This was in response to the Indonesian constitutional court finding it unconstitutional in 2021. Passed in late 2020, the omnibus law embodies President Joko Widodo’s ambition to attract foreign investors by slashing red tape at the cost of employees’ rights. It made it easier for businesses to lay off employees without prior notice. It also lowered statutory severance pay and extended the maximum length of temporary contracts, while ignoring worker safety. In 2022, its new formula to determine the minimum wage also resulted in the lowest annual increase ever. The law attracted much criticism from workers, activists and civil society organisations. The new emergency regulation is arguably even more problematic. The majority of its provision simply copies the omnibus law. Several changes and additional provisions are confusing and overlap with previous regulations, as well as leaving many loopholes that could be exploited in future. Yet despite complaints from workers and trade unions that the new rules were passed suddenly and without consultation, strike action is out of the question. Strikes are not popular because they can only be organised with permission from the company in question. If labourers hold informal strikes, employers also entitled to get rid of them. Public protests are the obvious alternative, though pandemic rules restricting mobility and mass gatherings have made these difficult. Nevetheless, thousands or perhaps even millions of workers staged protests in their respective cities in the second half of 2022. The workers wanted the omnibus law revoked, and for the government to not use the minimum wage formulations stipulated in the law. The demonstrations got more intense as the government raised subsidised fuel prices in September, which boosted already high inflation due to rising food prices. The government has since issued a separate regulation to determine the 2023 minimum wage, so the demands were successful, although both workers and employers are furious that the minimum wage rules have changed again under the emergency regulation. Clearly the protesters did not see the rest of the rules in the omnibus law removed. Some workers have been protesting on social media. This might not induce the government to change the law, but a few viral tweets have pushed several businesses to change abusive practices. The controversy is likely to continue in 2023 and into the election year of 2024, especially amid possible massive layoffs in the midst of a global recession. United States: worker protest showing signs of life Marick Masters, Professor of Business and Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Wayne State University US workers organised and took to the picket line in increased numbers in 2022 to demand better pay and working conditions, leading to optimism among labour leaders and advocates that they’re witnessing a turnaround in labour’s sagging fortunes. Teachers, journalists and baristas were among tens of thousands of workers who went on strike. And it took an act of Congress to prevent 115,000 railroad employees from walking out as well. In total, there have been at least 20 major work stoppages involving upwards of 1,000 workers each in 2022, up from 16 in 2021, plus hundreds more that were smaller. Workers at Starbucks, Amazon, Apple and dozens of other companies also filed over 2,000 petitions to form unions during the year – the most since 2015. Workers won 76% of the 1,363 elections that were held. Historically, however, these figures are tepid. The number of major work stoppages has been plunging for decades, from nearly 200 as recently as 1980. As of 2021, union membership was at about the lowest level on record, at 10.3%. In the 1950s, over one in three workers belonged to a union. The deck is still heavily stacked against unions, with unsupportive labour laws and very few employers showing real receptivity to having a unionised workforce. Unions are limited in how much they can change public policy. Reforming labour law through legislation has remained elusive, and the results of the 2022 midterms are not likely to make it easier. Nonetheless, public support for labour is at its highest since 1965, with 71% saying they approve of unions, according to a Gallup poll in August. And workers themselves are increasingly showing an interest in joining them. In 2017, 48% of workers polled said they would vote for union representation, up from 32% in 1995, the last time the question was asked. Future success may depend on unions’ ability to tap into their growing popularity and emulate the recent wins in establishing union representation at Starbucks and Amazon, as well as the successful “Fight for $15” campaign, which since 2012 has helped pass US$15 minimum wage laws in a dozen states and Washington DC. The odds may be steep, but the seeds of opportunity are there if labour can exploit them. This is an excerpt from an article published on January 5 2023. France: militant unions risk going too far Stéphanie Matteudi-Lecocq, Chercheuse au LEREDS, Directrice practice Chez Alixio, Université de Lille France in 2022 saw new industrial protests, from blockades of oil refineries, to unprecedented strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants, to rail workers staying at home on public holidays. TotalEnergies announced “super profits” in the second quarter of 2022 and increased CEO Patrick Pouyanné’s salary by 52% to €5,944,129. In September the militant CGT union demanded a 10% salary increase for workers and called for a strike at the group’s refineries. Five of Total’s refineries went on strike, joined by two owned by ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso. Esso was already talking to its unions about a pay deal, but Total had only planned to open negotiations in November. The strikes in the refineries threatened to bring France to a standstill, and the CGT used its power over this key resource to demand that discussions begin more quickly with Total (in the end, the company negotiated earlier and pay deals were done, ending the strikes by early November). The strike at EDF’s nuclear power stations similarly gave the company’s workers the balance of power because it made it impossible for France to build up energy reserves (since fossil fuels had to be burned to make up for the lack of nuclear power). In the end, the company signed deals with the unions in October. Unions may have succeeded in both cases, but they are arguably endangered by these kinds of practices. Too many trades union leaders remain stuck in their old militant ways. There’s a fragile balance between negotiation and protest, and such ransom tactics might damage unions’ public image, making dialogue more difficult in future. In 50 years, the rate of unionisation in France has already halved from over 20% to around 10%. It’s telling that two of the major strikes at the end of 2022, first by train workers and then by general practitioners, were initiated by groups independent from the unions. They both started spontaneously through social media and the unions found out very late. In 2023 the unions have an opportunity to improve their influence if they manage to prevent the government from passing its unpopular bill on pensions, which seeks to raise the full pensionable retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65. The unions have already announced their strong opposition to the bill. With major demonstrations due to take place after the full bill is presented today, January 10, it will be interesting to see their tactics. This is based on an excerpt from an article published in October 2022. Spain: unequal support measures could cause trouble Rubén Garrido-Yserte, Director del Instituto Universitario de Análisis Económico y Social, Universidad de Alcalá Global inflation is triggering a global economic slowdown and interest rates raised to levels not seen since before 2008. Interest rates will continue to rise in 2023, especially affecting economies as indebted as Spain. It will undermine both families’ disposable income and the profitability of companies (especially small ones), while making public debt repayments more expensive. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to cause a sustained increase in the cost of the shopping basket in the medium term. Government measures have partially mitigated this loss of purchasing power so far. Spain capped power prices, subsidised fuel and made public transport free for urbanites and commuters. There were agreements with banks to refinance mortgages for the most vulnerable families. Plus there have been increases in pensions and public salaries and there are plans to raise the minimum wage. However, many of these measures must necessarily be temporary. The danger is that they come to be seen as rights that should not be renounced. They also distort the economy and create problems with fairness by excluding or insufficiently supporting some groups. Private salaries will not rise enough to cover inflation, for instance. The government’s measures have been such that there has been very little industrial action in response to the cost of living crisis. The danger is that they create a scenario where today’s calm may be the harbinger of a social storm tomorrow.

Ms Somerville said there is still “some distance” between the two sides in the pay dispute. On Tuesday, primary schools around the country closed after last-ditch talks failed to prevent strike action, with secondary school staff set to walk out on Wednesday. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. A meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT), which brings together unions, local authorities and the Scottish Government, took place on Monday in an attempt to avert the strike action. As the Scottish Parliament resumed following the winter recess, Conservative Stephen Kerr spoke about the SNCT meeting. He said: “Teachers are on strike for the first time in 40 years, because this SNP Government has repeatedly let them down.” Ms Somerville said it had been “constructive”, adding that she could not give further details while negotiations are ongoing. Referring to “anti-trade union” legislation at Westminster, she continued: “I will take no lectures from Mr Kerr or any other Conservative member of this parliament, saying that we should be doing more to actually settle disputes.” The Lib Dems’ Willie Rennie asked if there would be a new offer for teachers, saying: “The Education Secretary does seem to be very chilled out and relaxed.” Ms Somerville said both sides in the dispute would have to compromise in order to reach a resolution, adding: “We will, of course, leave no stone unturned to try and do that as quickly as possible. “No one wants to see strike action in our schools.” Speaking on BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland programme earlier, Ms Somerville described the union pay demands as “simply unaffordable”. After talks ended in failure, members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), NASUWT, Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association (SSTA) and the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS) are taking strike action. It follows SSTA and NASUWT members taking two days of action in December while EIS members walked out on November 24. Asked whether she expected a new offer to be on the table before the end of the week, Ms Somerville said: “We’ll continue discussions with the unions. “I think the challenge that we have is we remain some distance apart on what the Scottish Government and local government can afford and can put on the table from the union demand which is, of course, a 10% increase in pay. “If that had been accepted, if the 5% had been accepted, you would’ve actually seen teachers have a 21.8% cumulative rise since 2018. “So we’re trying very hard to have a fair and affordable package on the table but we do remain unfortunately some distance apart.” She added: “The pay demands we’re having from our trade union colleagues are simply unaffordable for the Scottish Government working on a fixed budget, already allocated, also eroded by inflation and that does make it a very difficult and challenging process to come to a conclusion and resolution on.” Earlier in the programme, Mike Corbett, NASUWT Scotland national official, echoed the concerns that unions and Government were still far away from agreement on pay. He said the last offer made in November was “dressed up as an improved offer” but did not improve pay for the “vast majority of teachers”. He added: “There’s still no formal revised offer on the table and that is the reason why our members and others feel they’ve got no alternative but to be out on strike again today and tomorrow.” Nicola Sturgeon also spoke to journalists about the strike on Tuesday. The First Minister said: “I deeply regret that we have industrial action in our schools. “I don’t think that’s in the interest of young people at all. “That said, I understand the strength of feeling of teachers and we highly value the teaching profession.” However, she said: “I can’t create additional funding that we don’t have and I’ve tried to be really honest with unions across the public sector. “We’re trying to be as fair as possible while maximising pay increases.”",Somerville: No stone will be left unturned in bid to resolve school strikes,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/scottish-government-teachers-education-secretary-scottish-parliament-conservative-b1052061.html

Gareth Davies, the auditor and comptroller general at the NAO, said keeping on top of conflicts of interest was a “crucial part of public stewardship” that was not always followed during the VIP fast lane process. He said the government had given detailed responses on how it would improve its processes after reports from the NAO and others highlighting a failure to adhere to basic standards of procurement when awarding some contracts during the pandemic. But the auditor general said the NAO was watching closely to make sure its recommendations on procurement and pandemic preparedness “do not get lost” as the government deals with other crises such as Ukraine and high energy prices. “We are always careful to recognise the exceptional circumstances but despite the intense pressure it is always necessary to cover basic areas of transparency,” Davies said. “Publishing what you’ve done within the normal timescales is still possible even in an emergency and the whole process around conflicts of interest. “You may well need a speeded up system for referring plausible suppliers of PPE into the system but you should absolutely insist that people should declare it if they have a private interest in that supplier, particularly if they are holding a position of authority or responsibility like a peer or an MP or a senior civil servant. That just couldn’t be demonstrated. “There were clearly people attempting to do that at different stages but there wasn’t a clear trail of how that had been handled. The reason was the sheer pressure of the emergency but you can see now where that leads you if you are not careful.” His comments come after the scandal over Mone, on a leave of absence as a Conservative peer, who is the subject of an inquiry over her alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro during the pandemic. She has vowed to clear her name. Davies gave his assessment after the NAO carried out 36 detailed reports on the £300bn of government’s spending during the Covid pandemic. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the NAO was looking carefully at resilience to help the UK become better financially prepared for events that may require big public spending, guarding against the “collective failure of imagination” to prepare adequately for a major pandemic. He said there would be better “stress testing” of emergency responses, and the NAO would look at preparedness across the board, asking: “How do you avoid being caught out by this?” “You could argue it has happened on more than just Covid. What’s happening on energy is pretty unprecedented and needs another emergency scheme developed at high speed from scratch. We don’t want to have to do that every time,” he said. Davies also warned about the effects of inflation on public sector budgets, especially major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and roads, as well as highlighting the risks that the NHS will not meet its targets on eliminating waits of longer than a year by 2025. Davies said the NAO has been pointing out the “headwinds that the NHS is facing in implementing the planned approach” to waiting lists as well as highlighting the “numbers that the plan was based on assumed the best case scenario … not a severe winter in cases of flu and … [without] the industrial action that is currently under way”. He said the NAO’s report from November highlighted “serious risks” in meeting the 2025 target on eliminating waits of longer than 12 months and its job was now to monitor progress and “help identify barriers to getting through the backlog faster”. “Clearly, a lot of those risks that we identified are still present,” he added. Rishi Sunak recommitted to the NHS waiting list targets last week as one of his major priorities. Davies said inflation was a major risk to the NHS budget as well as departments with exposure to construction costs such as “HS2 and the other rail and road improvement schemes”. Warning that the government has “difficult decisions” ahead on major infrastructure projects, he said it was possible to reduce the scope of some projects or make the case for more money but on others said: “You either do it or you don’t: you have a have binary choice there. So there are some very difficult decisions for government.” Davies said HS2 was a “good example where the legs that have currently been committed to are going to cost more than when the most recent decision to recommit to the schemes was taken, so that’s going to have to be taken into account in one way or another, either through additional funding or through looking at the future scope of the scheme”.","MPs and peers should declare links to firms they back for contracts, says NAO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/mps-and-peers-should-declare-links-to-firms-they-back-for-contracts-says-nao

But growing NHS waiting lists, diminishing access to treatment and surging economic inactivity due to ill-health are all weighing on productivity in the UK. “Businesses that proactively implement effective incentivisation and employee benefits programmes throughout their entire workforce will be best placed to retain staff, drive better performance and grow in a post-Covid landscape.”UK bank NatWest has announced a new package of Cost of Living support measures, including £5.7m of funding for charities and partners.NatWest is giving £1m to the Trussell Trust, the food bank charity, to support the Help through Hardship scheme, plus over £1.6m to the debt advice sector; £900k for Responsible Finance to support provision of accessible credit to people; and a £1m partnership with Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) to provide cost of living support.NatWest is also giving struggling customers more time to repay debts, it says: From early February this year, where customers have missed several payments on an unsecured debt such as a loan or overdraft, the bank will extend the time for them to repay their debt from 18 to 24 months, giving them more time and flexibility. European financial markets are relatively upbeat after a good showing on Wall Street last night, ahead of the next US inflation numbers on Thursday, says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.“It helped that a speech by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell yesterday didn’t contain any shocks which would cause investors to worry about markets even more.

Régis Schultz, the chief executive of JD, said young shoppers had more cash in their pockets than a year ago thanks to the reopening of retail and hospitality which had provided jobs, while inflation had prompted people to go out and buy instead of waiting for bargains. He added that competition from online pure plays was waning as the costs of delivery racked up. “Investors are now saying to online players you have got to make money.

In the meantime, though, concerns about a recession and some doubts about how quickly Chinese demand will rebound when Covid infections are so high are putting a lid on any upside in oil.Investors are also relieved that Jerome Powell, the head of America’s Federal Reserve central bank, didn’t push back against expectations of a slowing in US interest rate rises when he spoke yesterday.The markets are also hoping for a drop in US inflation, when the latest consumer price index figures are released.Boyadjian points out that a drop in inflation could encourage the Fed to stop hiking interest rates as rapidly.Sentiment was boosted on Friday from signs that wage pressures in the United States are easing and that the services sector is headed for a sharp slowdown, but the hawkish rhetoric that later followed revived recession worries.

Heathrow says this is the highest passenger increase of any airport in Europe, “and possibly worldwide”.But it warns:We are concerned that the recovery of the aviation sector, which is critical to the economy, could be set back by the reintroduction of testing for travellers in the UK and elsewhere in response to increasing COVID levels in China, even though governments acknowledge there is no scientific basis for doing so.UK prime minister Rishi Sunak decided to introduce tests on arrivals from China at the end of December, after other countries including the US and Italy brought in similar measures.But scientists told the Observer that screening people coming from China would make little difference, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the UK was already very high, while airport checks had been shown to be unreliable in pinpointing disease carriers.Sunak’s U-turn on China Covid tests is a political move, say scientistsRead moreIf there is to be a correction in UK house prices, it will be driven by the homeowners whose fixed rate mortgage deals are set to expire over the next 12 months, says Zainab Atiyyah, analyst at Third Bridge.Mortgage and Bank of England interest rates started to increase during 2022 – and at least 1.4 millionUK households face the prospect of interest rate rises when they renew their fixed rate mortgages this year.➡️ https://t.co/HwWjla2Iwl pic.twitter.com/QKvIRIYbOU— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 9, 2023 But the UK’s “massive undersupply of new-build and second-hand houses.” will cushion that effect, Atiyyah points out.“Overall, our experts expect a slowdown in sales to continue in 2023 despite new stamp duty thresholds, as supply continues to dwindle.” “Those on Help to Buy deals will be crossing their fingers and hoping their deals don’t fall apart as new homes are delayed or not completed by the end of the year.

It has helped three thousand customers deal with burst pipes, water tanks and other related damage.Direct Line says:This, together with the freeze event from January 2022 and subsidence related claims over the summer means that we currently expect total weather claims to be in the region of £140 million for 2022, well above our 2022 expectation of £73 million.Direct Line’s motor insurance division also saw an increase in third party claims inflation during the fourth quarter of last year, and more claims in the quarter --partly due to adverse weather conditions.Shares in Direct Line have tumbled 28%, to 166p.JD Sports has also predicted its profits will be towards the top end of expectations, following a jump in sales over Christmas.JD Sports’ revenues grew by over 10% in the 22 weeks to 31 December 2022, accelerating to more than 20% in the six-weeks to 31 December 2022.It now expects pre-tax profits for the year to 28 January to be “towards the top end” of market expectations (£933m to £985m), although the final performance depends how the post-Christmas sales go.Shares in JD Sports have jumped 4.6% in early trading, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.Record sales of Champagne and prosecco have helped to push profits at Sainsbury’s to the upper end of forecasts.The supermarket chain has reported that profits this year are expected to be towards the upper end of its guidance range of £630m to £690m, although still below last year’s profits of £730m.J Sainsbury’s retail sales, excluding fuel, rose by 5.2% year-on-year in its third quarter (to 7th January). Grocery sales were 5.6% higher – and 12.5% ahead of pre-pandemic levels.And in the Christmas period, sales rose 7.1%, with grocery sales up 7.1%, general merchandise sales up 7.4% and clothing sales up 5.1%.That included a 22% jump in Taste the Difference Mince Pies, and a 49% rise in Taste the Difference Panettone, while there was “record sales for Champagne and prosecco”.But Simon Roberts, chief executive of J Sainsbury, flags that 2023 will be tough for households.“We understand money will be exceptionally tight this year particularly as many people wait for Christmas bills to land.

Rishi Sunak had previously refused to say whether he uses private healthcare, insisting it was ""not really relevant"". It followed a press report that Mr Sunak is registered with a private GP practice which charges £250 per consultation. At PMQs, Mr Sunak praised his local hospital ""for the fantastic care they have given my family"". ""That's why I'm passionately committed to protecting it with more funding, more doctors and nurses, and a clear plan to cut the waiting lists,"" he added. Mr Sunak had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that his healthcare was ""a personal choice"". ""As a general policy I wouldn't ever talk about me or my family's healthcare situation … it's not really relevant,"" he told the programme. Registering with an NHS GP does not exclude someone from using private healthcare. The prime minister's spokeswoman said Mr Sunak did not currently have private cover but declined to say when he registered with the NHS. ""In principle, he believes that the personal health details of individuals should remain private, but given the level of interest and in the interests of transparency he has set out that he is registered with a NHS GP,"" she said. A newspaper report in November suggested Mr Sunak was registered with a private GP practice that offers on-the-day appointments and home visits. Latest NHS figures show that in November last year, 58% of NHS patients were not seen on the day they made an appointment. At the same time, a record high of more than seven million people are waiting for hospital treatment. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in response to Mr Sunak's comments that the prime minister ""will find out what it's like to wait on hold at 08:00 as you call for an appointment"". Sir Keir's spokesman confirmed the Labour leader had never used private healthcare. He said he was ""not going to comment on individual health choices"" and Labour was focused on ""ensuring we have the best possible NHS"" for everyone in the country. Sir Keir also clashed with Mr Sunak over the government's plan for new legislation to enforce minimum service levels in the NHS and other key sectors. The Tories had gone ""from clapping nurses to sacking nurses"", Sir Keir said, adding that nurses and ambulance workers would not be on strike if the prime minister had negotiated. The prime minister said Sir Keir would not agree to minimum service levels in the NHS ""because he's on the side of his union paymasters, not patients"". Mr Sunak added that he wanted ""to have constructive dialogue with the unions"" and had accepted the recommendations of independent pay review bodies. Earlier, health unions announced they are pulling out of the NHS Pay Review Body process to determine pay for next year. The 14 unions - representing more than one million ambulance staff, nurses and other NHS workers in England - have called for direct negotiations with ministers about pay. Mr Sunak's comments followed Health Secretary Steve Barclay confirming he used an NHS doctor. Pressed on whether he has NHS care during an interview on LBC, Mr Barclay replied: ""Yes, I don't subscribe to private provision. ""But I don't have a problem with people, with their own money, who wish to spend that money on private healthcare. ""I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing for people to want to do."" Some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have made a point of drawing attention to their use of the NHS when they were prime minister. David Cameron often spoke about how the NHS cared for his disabled son, while Boris Johnson said the health service saved his life after he fell seriously ill with Covid. But when Mrs Thatcher was prime minister she was candid about her use of private health insurance, which she said was vital for her to ""go into hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want"".",PMQs: Rishi Sunak says he is registered with NHS doctor,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64237830?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Mr Kerr slammed the SNP for treating experienced workers as being easily replaceable after the report stated “the age profile of oil and gas workers means a significant proportion are expected to retire” during the First Minister’s acceleration of closing the industry. The energy strategy added it is positive that fewer young people were entering the sector, stating 12 per cent of the oil and gas workforce is under 30. This is despite warnings from the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board that more workers are required to meet future levels of labour demand. But the SNP’s aim of closing down the sector is at odds with what their Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, believes after he said last year that investment in North Sea oil and gas was vital for jobs in Aberdeen. Mr Kerr, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for net zero, energy and transport, said: “The SNP is threatening to destroy the lives of oil and gas workers with its uninformed intention of closing down the sector at its earliest point. “The assertion that the majority of these workers will be retiring is utterly reckless and a slap in the face to those who have dedicated years of service to such a valuable industry to our north-east economy. “This report implies it is a good thing fewer young people are entering the sector when all the evidence points to the very opposite as more people are needed to cope with labour demand. “The negative narrative of this is putting our younger generation off from having a long, productive career in an industry which supports countries worldwide. “Oil and gas is essential to securing our energy supply while also protecting tens of thousands of Scottish jobs. Yet this SNP energy strategy completely undermines the sector which will result in us relying on more expensive imports which do more damage to the environment. “This last week, many north-east residents watched in horror as a baleful, unnatural force threatened to hamper the livelihoods of North Sea workers. “After Nicola Sturgeon’s bid to toss more than 70,000 oil and gas jobs in the skip and wreck the energy transition, they should probably give it another week before trying to watch The Rig as well.” Do you want to respond to this article?

This is as true of climate chaos as anything else. We are hemmed in by stories that prevent us from seeing, or believing in, or acting on the possibilities for change. Some are habits of mind, some are industry propaganda. Sometimes, the situation has changed but the stories haven’t, and people follow the old versions, like outdated maps, into dead ends. We need to leave the age of fossil fuel behind, swiftly and decisively. But what drives our machines won’t change until we change what drives our ideas. The visionary organiser adrienne maree brown wrote not long ago that there is an element of science fiction in climate action: “We are shaping the future we long for and have not yet experienced. I believe that we are in an imagination battle.” In order to do what the climate crisis demands of us, we have to find stories of a livable future, stories of popular power, stories that motivate people to do what it takes to make the world we need. Perhaps we also need to become better critics and listeners, more careful about what we take in and who’s telling it, and what we believe and repeat, because stories can give power – or they can take it away. To change our relationship to the physical world – to end an era of profligate consumption by the few that has consequences for the many – means changing how we think about pretty much everything: wealth, power, joy, time, space, nature, value, what constitutes a good life, what matters, how change itself happens. As the climate journalist Mary Heglar writes, we are not short on innovation. “We’ve got loads of ideas for solar panels and microgrids. While we have all of these pieces, we don’t have a picture of how they come together to build a new world. For too long, the climate fight has been limited to scientists and policy experts. While we need their skills, we also need so much more. When I survey the field, it’s clear that what we desperately need is more artists.” What the climate crisis is, what we can do about it, and what kind of a world we can have is all about what stories we tell and whose stories are heard. Climate change was a story that fell on mostly indifferent ears when it was first discussed in the mainstream more than 30 years ago. Even a dozen years ago, it was supposed to be happening very slowly and in the distant future. There were a lot of references to “our grandchildren’s time”. It was a problem that was difficult to grasp – this dispersed, incremental, atmospheric, invisible, global problem with many causes and manifestations, whose solutions are also dispersed and manifold. That voices from the climate movement have finally succeeded in making the vast majority understand it, and many care passionately about it, might be the biggest single victory the movement will have. Because once you’ve won the popular imagination, you’ve changed the game and its possible outcomes. But this was a long, slow, arduous process, and misconceptions still abound. A lot of people don’t know that we’ve largely won the battle to make people aware and concerned. The LA Times ran a well-intentioned editorial last year about how most Americans don’t care about climate breakdown. That was true once, but no longer is. A Pew Research poll in 2020 concluded that two-thirds of Americans wanted to see more government action on climate, but last summer the scientific journal Nature published a study concluding that most Americans believe that only a minority (37-43%) support climate action, when in reality a large majority (66-80%) does. That gap between perceived and actual support undermines motivation and confidence. We need better stories – and sometimes better means more up to date. Outright climate denial – the old story that climate change isn’t real – has been rendered largely obsolete (outside social media) by climate-driven catastrophes around the globe and good work by climate activists and journalists. But other stories still stop us from seeing clearly. Greenwashing – the schemes created by fossil fuel corporations and others to portray themselves as on the environment’s side while they continue their profitable destruction – is rampant. It’s harder to recognise a false friend than an honest enemy, and their false solutions, delaying tactics and empty promises can be confusing for non-experts. Fortunately, as the climate movement has diversified, one new organisation, Clean Creatives, focuses specifically on pressuring advertising and PR agencies to stop doing the industry’s dirty work. Likewise, climate journalists are exposing how fossil fuel money is funding pseudo-environmental opposition to offshore wind turbines. (As the climate activist and oil policy analyst Antonia Juhasz recently told me, the climate movement is now going after every aspect of the fossil fuel industry, including funding by banks and, via the divestment movement, shares held by investors; donations to politicians; insurers; permits for extraction; transport; refinement; emissions, notably through lawsuits concerning their impact; shutting coal-fired power plants; and pushing for a rapid transition to electrification.) But we still lack stories that give context. For example, I see people excoriate the mining, principally for lithium and cobalt, that will be an inevitable part of building renewables – turbines, batteries, solar panels, electric machinery – apparently oblivious to the far vaster scale and impact of fossil fuel mining. If you’re concerned about mining on indigenous land, about local impacts or labour conditions, I give you the biggest mining operations ever undertaken: for oil, gas, and coal, and the hungry machines that must constantly consume them. Extracting material that will be burned up creates the incessant cycle of consumption on which the fossil fuel industry has grown fabulously rich. It creates climate chaos as well as destruction and contamination at every stage of the process. Globally, burning fossil fuels kills almost 9 million people annually, a death toll larger than any recent war. But that death toll is largely invisible for lack of compelling stories about it. All mining needs to be done with respect for the land and people in the vicinity, but the impact of mining for renewables needs to be weighed against the far more devastating impact of mining for and burning fossil fuel. The race is on to find battery materials that are more commonly available and less impactful than lithium and cobalt, and some of the results look promising. Last summer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced an aluminium-sulphur battery is in the works, while a US company is developing one that stores electricity using iron – the so-called “iron-air” battery. Efforts to extract battery materials from longterm coal waste in West Virginia are among the many others under way. And the Inflation Reduction Act includes funding to research better battery materials and domestic US sources. Other stories of premature defeat are all too common. In the 400,000-strong 2014 climate march in New York City, one section marched behind a huge banner declaring “WE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS” – but many people still believe we do not. We have the solutions we need in solar and wind; we just need to build them out and make the transition, fast. Looking to wildly ineffectual carbon sequestration and other undeveloped technologies as a relevant solution is like ignoring the lifeboats at hand in the hope that fancy new ones are coming when the ship is sinking and speed is of the essence. One story I frequently encounter frames the possibilities in absolutes: if we can’t win everything, then we lose everything. There are so many doom-soaked stories out there – about how civilisation, humanity, even life itself, are scheduled to die out. This apocalyptic thinking is due to another narrative failure: the inability to imagine a world different than the one we currently inhabit. People without much sense of history imagine the world as static. They assume that if the present order is failing, the system is collapsing, and there is no alternative. A historical imagination equips you to understand that change is ceaseless. You only have to look to the past to see such a world, dramatically different half a century ago, stunningly so a century ago. The UK, for example, ran almost entirely on coal power until the 1960s, and if you had said then that it would have to quit coal, many would have imagined this meant an utter collapse of the energy system, not its transformation. Even in 2008, the organisation Carbon Brief noted, “four-fifths of the UK’s electricity came from fossil fuels. Since then, the UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy. Coal-fired power has virtually disappeared and even gas use is down by a quarter. Instead, the country now gets more than half of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear.” Scotland already generates nearly all the electricity it needs from renewables. While I often hear people casually assert that our world is doomed, no reputable scientist makes such claims. Most are deeply worried, but far from hopeless. There are already profound losses, but our action or inaction determine how much more loss will occur, and whose it will be, and some repair is possible. Efforts sufficient to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lower temperatures and reverse some aspects of climate breakdown. Even the journalist David Wallace-Wells, who rose to fame with a deeply pessimistic book about climate a few years ago, has shifted his view. He currently describes a future somewhere between the best and worst case scenarios, a future “with the most terrifying predictions made improbable by decarbonisation and the most hopeful ones practically foreclosed by tragic delay. The window of possible climate futures is narrowing, and as a result, we are getting a clearer sense of what’s to come: a new world, full of disruption … yet mercifully short of true climate apocalypse.” A climate story we urgently need is one that exposes who is actually responsible for climate chaos. It’s been popular to say that we are all responsible, but Oxfam reports that over the past 25 years, the carbon impact of the top 1% of the wealthiest human beings was twice that of the bottom 50%, so responsibility for the impact and the capacity to make change is currently distributed very unevenly. By saying “we are all responsible”, we avoid the fact that the global majority of us don’t need to change much, but a minority needs to change a lot. This is also a reminder that the idea that we need to renounce our luxuries and live more simply doesn’t really apply to the majority of human beings outside what we could perhaps call the overdeveloped world. What is true of Beverly Hills is not true of the majority from Bangladesh to Bolivia. When it comes to who’s harming the climate, it’s also been popular to focus on individual contributions. The fossil fuel industry likes the narrative of personal responsibility as a way to keep us scrutinising ourselves and one another, rather than them. They’ve promoted the concept of climate footprints as a way to keep the focus on us and not them, and it’s worked. Usually if I ask people what they’re doing about the climate emergency, most will talk about what they’re not consuming or doing – but these will never add up to the speed and scale of change needed to change the system. One of the goals of system change is to supersede individual virtue. Just as you no longer have to opt in to buying a car with seatbelts or ask for the no-smoking section on the train or restaurant, at some point in the near future you won’t have to opt into travelling in an electric car or bus, or living or working in all-electric buildings. Electrification will have happened because of the collective action that takes shape as policy and regulation. Last year, the veteran environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a brilliant analysis pointing out that if you have money in one of the banks funding fossil fuels – especially, in the US, Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, and Bank of America – your retirement funds or savings account may have a much larger climate footprint than you do. The impact of your diet and how you get to work may pale in comparison to the impact of your money in the bank. The vegan on the bicycle may still be contributing to climate chaos if her life savings are in a bank lending her money to the fossil fuel industry. Individual impact, leaving the ultra-wealthy aside, matters mostly in the aggregate. And in aggregate we can change that. On 21 March, McKibben, via his new climate group Third Act (on whose advisory board I sit), and dozens of other climate groups will be organising actions by people with money in, or credit cards from, the key US banks, to try to force those institutions to stop funding fossil fuels. Our greatest power lies in our roles as citizens, not consumers, when we can band together to collectively change how our world works. Various campaigns around the world have focused on fossil finance, with significant successes behind them, and much more to achieve ahead. The climate movement has become far more sophisticated and precise in its targets in recent years. It’s doing a brilliant job; it just needs enough people and resources behind it to be more powerful than the status quo. Last year, I took three activists who were formerly part of the Sunrise Movement, a youth group campaigning to address climate breakdown, to see the 1991 film Terminator 2 at a cinema. The film was as great as I remembered, not least because the lead character, Linda Hamilton playing a ferocious young mother, chooses as her motto “no fate but what we make”. In that movie, the future has come back to meddle with the present through the sci-fi technologies of time travel and robot-warrior terminators. We see how actions in the present shape the future through tremendous battles over what that future will be. This is, of course, just as true in real life. We don’t get terminators and other time-travellers to tell us what the consequences of our actions are, but they still have consequences. You ban the insecticide DDT, and a lot of bird species stop dying out. You ban chlorofluorocarbons, and the hole in the ozone layer stops growing. In another way, Terminator 2 is less useful as a lens for thinking about the climate crisis. It’s part of the conventions of storytelling in film – and comics, fiction, graphic novels and too many news narratives – that tells us that the world can only be saved by exceptional individuals, often loners, whose gifts are often the capacity to inflict and endure extreme violence. Linda Hamilton and co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot, clobber, crush, outrun and outfight everything thrown at them, and that’s their celebrated skillset, along with a bit of dry humour. Humour aside, this has little to do with how the world really gets changed most of the time. The skills of real-world superheroes are solidarity, strategy, patience, persistence, vision and the ability to inspire hope in others. The rescuers we need are mostly not individuals, they are collectives – movements, coalitions, campaigns, civil society. Within those groups there may be someone with an exceptional gift for motivating others, but even the world’s greatest conductor needs an orchestra. One person cannot do much; a movement can topple a regime. We are sadly lacking stories in which collective actions or the patient determination of organisers is what changes the world. Another thing we get from our films and fictions is the expectation of a single solution and a clear resolution to our problems: a sudden victory, a celebration, and the trouble is over. The climate crisis does not fit easily into this format. Ceasing to extract and burn fossil fuel is central, but there is no single solution. Protecting carbon-sequestering peat bogs, forests and grasslands also matters; so does transforming high-impact materials such as cement; implementing better design for buildings, transport and cities, and addressing soil conservation, farming and food production and consumption. There are milestones and important goals, but the familiar Hollywood ending – crossing the finish line to wrap up the story – doesn’t describe this reality. Change often functions more like a relay race, with new protagonists picking up where the last left off. In 2019, a Berkeley city councilwoman decided to propose banning fossil-gas connections in new construction, and it was passed by the council unanimously. This small city’s commitment to all-electric new buildings could seem insignificant, but more than 50 other California municipalities picked it up, as did the city of New York. The state of New York failed to pass a similar measure, but Washington state succeeded, and the idea that new construction should not include gas has spread internationally. Such relay races have long been how human rights campaigns work: a good protest, campaign, or even piece of legislation can introduce new ideas that do their own work in the world at large. Even failed campaigns may succeed in opening the path for later change. The Green New Deal did not pass in the US Senate, but it became a template for the Biden administration’s climate legislation, and shifted the conversation about what is possible. It led the way to the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate bill the US has ever passed. Opponents of environmental action often say it is killing jobs; the Green New Deal did a lot to change that story by portraying climate action as a job creator. Recognising the reality of climate breakdown means recognising the interconnectedness of all things. That connection brings obligation: to respect nature, to build domestic regulation and international treaties that protect what’s needed, to limit the freedom of the individual in the name of the wellbeing of the collective. This is, of course, a worldview in direct contrast with free-market fundamentalism and libertarianism. Even the facts of climate science are ideologically offensive to people committed to individual freedom without accountability, let alone the demands created by treaties and regulations. Responsibility and obligation are dismal words in mainstream culture, so perhaps there will be other stories that recognise this process as reciprocity and relationship, in which we give back, in gratitude and respect for all the Earth does for us. Even short of that, we can recognise our self-interest in maintaining the system on which life depends. If news is the daily report on what’s just happened, we need a way of pulling back from individual events, to see the broad context of how it happened. If you only tell short-term stories, it all becomes kind of meaningless. Martin Luther King Jr said: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” We’ve seen it bend a lot of ways in recent years, toward and away from justice, but it takes time just to see it bend at all. You need benchmarks or memories of how things used to be even to see change of any kind, including climate change. The South Pacific climate activist and poet Julian Aguon recently declared that Indigenous peoples “have a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory, and just might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect – for the Earth and for each other”. That emphasis on collective memory suggests that a strong sense of the past allows for a strong sense of the future, that remembering difficulty and transformation equips us to face them again. One of the things that buoys me up is the long arc of change in renewable technology. Mostly what you see in the news about renewables is short-term: stories on the latest drop in price, or proliferation of solar and wind over the past year or two. If you enlarge your time frame, you see that those annual changes have amounted to an astonishing plummet in prices and rise in efficiency and global use, compounded by innovations in materials and storage. Twenty years ago we did not have constructive ways to leave the age of fossil fuel behind. Now we do. And the solutions keep getting better. In 2021, the organisation Carbon Tracker put out a report that showed current technology could produce 100 times as much electricity from solar and wind than current global demand. The report concludes: “The technical and economic barriers have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political.” At the end of the last millennium, those barriers seemed insurmountable. The change is revolutionary, but the revolution was too slow to be visible to most. The report continues: “At the current 15-20% growth rates of solar and wind, fossil fuels will be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050. The unlocking of energy reserves 100 times our current demand creates new possibilities for cheaper energy and more local jobs in a more equitable world, with far less environmental stress.” We tend to think utopias are unbelievable, but this is a sober-minded thinktank focused on climate and energy politics. The report made little impact on the general public. Because the energy revolution has been incremental, there’s been no single breakthrough moment. Yet it adds up to an encouraging, and even astonishing narrative. On the other hand, people find grim narratives all too believable, whether or not they are grounded in fact. We are still inundated by harmful, as well as untrue, stories about climate and the future. Prophecies can be self-fulfilling: if you insist that we cannot possibly win, you pit yourself against the possibility of victory and the people trying to achieve it. There’s yet another narrative that’s persisted at least since the invention of compact fluorescent lightbulbs and the Toyota Prius: that we must renounce abundance and enter an age of austerity. It’s all in the telling. To consider our age an age of abundance, you have to be counting sheer accumulated stuff and ignoring how it is distributed. That is, we live in an age of extreme wealth for some, and desperation for the many. But there’s another way to count wealth and abundance – as hope for the future, safety and public confidence, emotional wellbeing, love and friendship and strong social networks, meaningful work and purposeful lives, equality and justice and inclusion. Early on, we heard that renewables were very expensive – this was part of the austerity narrative, or an excuse for not making the transition. But improvements in design and economies of scale are among the factors making them the cheapest form of electricity almost everywhere on earth. There’s no reason to think the innovations of design and economic improvements are all behind us; I suspect they’re mostly ahead of us. Engineer and energy expert Saul Griffith recently wrote: “Most people believe a clean-energy future will require everyone to make do with less, but it actually means we can have better things.” The old story was that we couldn’t afford to do what the climate emergency required. The new one is that it would not only be ecologically devastating, but more expensive not to. Renewables are on the way to being cheaper than fossil fuel; in many places, they already are. Texas and Iowa get a huge amount of their electricity from wind because it makes economic sense, not because these red states are passionate about addressing the climate crisis. Over their lifetime, electric cars work out to be cheaper than internal combustion cars because charging and maintaining them is cheaper. And of course these two examples don’t include the indirect effects of burning fossil fuels on human health and the climate. A lot of people tend to measure climate action in terms of huge national or international news events, but the change that matters is often happening at local and regional and other levels. A university divests; a state sets a date for ending the sale of new petrol cars; a city passes a measure mandating all-electric new buildings; ground is broken on a major solar installation; a state or country sets a new record for percentage of wind power in its energy mix; a pipeline or gas terminal or drilling site gets cancelled; a carbon-sequestering forest or peat bog gets protected status; a coal plant closes. This does not erase all the bad news, about continuing breakdown of natural systems and its toll on human lives and impact on a livable future, but it does contextualise them as crises we can respond to if we choose to. So much is happening, both wonderful and terrible, and it adds up to more stories than almost anyone can take in. But the overarching frameworks in which we receive them matter, and so do the critical skills to recognise, choose, and change stories. The climate crisis is a problem with no single solution, but many, just as there is no one saviour, but many protagonists in the struggle. In 2019, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said we must embrace “cathedral thinking”, adding: “We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.” The speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler included this passage in one of her essays: “OK,” the young man challenged. “So what’s the answer?” “There isn’t one,” I told him. “No answer? You mean we’re just doomed?” He smiled as though he thought this might be a joke. “No,” I said. “I mean there’s no single answer that will solve all of our future problems. There’s no magic bullet. Instead there are thousands of answers – at least. You can be one of them if you choose to be.” This is an edited version of a speech given at Princeton University in November 2022","‘If you win the popular imagination, you change the game’: why we need new stories on climate",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/12/rebecca-solnit-climate-crisis-popular-imagination-why-we-need-new-stories

If its construction goes to plan, a €2.5 billion (£2.18 billion) undersea pipeline will convey “green hydrogen” from Spain to France from 2030. In the US, some power stations are being upgraded to allow hydrogen to be blended with fossil gas, and the Norwegian oil company Equinor is teaming up with Thermal SSE to build a 1,800 megawatt (MW) “blue hydrogen” power plant in Britain. Meanwhile, China unveiled a plan in March which includes deploying 50,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2025 and early December saw the first hydrogen-fuelled tractors and forklifts leave the assembly line at a new plant in Guangdong province. Hydrogen is produced in multiple ways. A colour spectrum is used to render it simple. “Grey” and “brown/black” hydrogen come from fossil gas (methane) and coal (brown or black coal) respectively – a process that, for every tonne of hydrogen, emits between ten and 12 tonnes of CO₂ for grey hydrogen and 18 to 20 for brown. “Blue” is the same process except the carbon dioxide is supposed to be captured and stored underground. And “green” hydrogen is conventionally defined as generated from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. But only 0.04% of hydrogen is green, and blue hydrogen is less than 1%. The rest is grey or brown, most of which is used in oil refineries and for manufacturing ammonia and methanol. It’s an enormous industry which emits more CO₂ than all of Britain and France combined. It is widely hoped that a silver lining of today’s high gas prices will be green hydrogen becoming a cost-competitive alternative to dirty fuels in boilers, shipping tankers and steelworks furnaces. Unfortunately, without electricity market reform, this opportunity is likely to be squandered. And while the buzz around the hydrogen economy intensifies, a closer look suggests the fuel is less a spearhead for a green transition and more the subject of an elaborate bait-and-switch operation by oil companies. Hydrogen’s true colours Green hydrogen is essential for decarbonisation: to replace fossil fuels in steelmaking, ammonia production for fertilisers and possibly shipping and trucking – processes which are difficult to electrify. Some green hydrogen is crosshatched with dirtier hues. So it’s not simply that in its production a lot of energy is wasted in the double transformation from electricity to gas and then fuel. But burning hydrogen also emits nitrogen oxides, air pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain. If green hydrogen production is scaled up to play a significant economic role by 2050, its freshwater demand will exceed one-quarter of today’s global annual consumption, risking water scarcity in some regions. Above all, hydrogen is meaningfully green only if the renewable energy that generates it cannot be fed into the grid to replace power from gas or coal plants. Blue hydrogen relies on a similar – but much more harmful – trick of the light. For hydrogen to be true blue, the emissions must be captured and securely stored. In theory, carbon capture and storage works but nearly all plants use the captured carbon to pump more oil and many have been shut down as failures. Only a handful store carbon indefinitely and even these consume lots of energy and capture only some of the CO₂, which can leak. Blue hydrogen’s main source is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is notorious for escaping drilling wells and pipelines. Research suggests that these issues make blue hydrogen worse for the climate than fossil gas. In the EU, as in many economies, electricity pricing is based on the principle of marginal costs, which means that the most expensive source (typically fossil gas) sets the wholesale power price. During sunny or windy spells, a glut of renewable energy generation can slash electricity prices, freeing them from the grip of natural gas prices for a few hours at a time. This is often not enough to justify investments in the electrolysers which produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen won’t gain the necessary price advantage over blue hydrogen and fossil gas until electricity markets are restructured. Meanwhile, the high price of oil and gas has turbocharged the industry’s expansion. The US government is exhorting oil and fracking firms to “drill baby drill”. Britain’s government is to award more than 100 licenses to drill for oil and gas and colossal new fossil fuel investments have been announced across the Middle East and Africa. In a few years when these new sources come onstream, and particularly if economic growth continues to slow and depress energy demand, gas and oil will become cheaper again – until the next price spike prompts new rounds of investment, and the infernal cycle continues. The owners of newly-built wells, pipelines and terminals will fight to defend those assets and stall decarbonisation. Now fossil-fuel firms are rebranding themselves as agents of “carbon management.” The aim is to prevent their assets from getting stranded by repurposing them, presenting a largely fictional substance, blue hydrogen, as a low-carbon “bridge” to an unspecified green future. Other sectors have joined the oil-led coalition. As the engineer Tom Baxter observes, gas network operators and boiler manufacturers see their survival in this ploy. Utilities are similarly keen, as hydrogen’s inefficiencies allow them to sell more power. Tackling this stalling operation requires public policy. Governments will need to regulate or tax carbon out of the market while simultaneously ramping up renewables. The approach to electricity pricing also needs to shift, to decouple the prices of electricity generated from renewables and fossil gas. The marginal pricing system hugely benefits renewable project owners, since they profit from high electricity prices and effectively zero input costs. An alternative market structure would set rewards for generators according to their average costs plus a slight surplus which could be reinvested into deploying more renewables and other green technologies, providing consumers with cheap electricity. This can only be achieved through a robustly regulated market or by nationalising energy companies and setting prices and production. These interventions would give green hydrogen a competitive advantage over blue or grey variants, one that could be furthered with other subsidies, such as tax credits on the model of the US Inflation Reduction Act. Above all, energy demand must be reduced to ease upward pressure on price. In any future energy system, hydrogen will have a role. But its expansion must be carefully designed, to prevent the promise of green hydrogen disguising the risks of its blue and grey cousins.

The company, which is part of Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, will begin consultations over 440 redundancies and said it will idle its plant at West Bromwich and convert another in Newport, Wales, into a storage facility. Jobs are also likely to be lost at its Rotherham plant after Liberty said it became “unviable” to produce cheaper steel products, “due to high energy costs and imports from countries without the same environmental standards”. The firm will now focus on steel for defence, energy and aircraft-making clients in a bid to regain profitability. Jeffrey Kabel, Chief Transformation Officer for Liberty Steel Group said: “While our action is expected to regrettably impact the roles of some of our workforce we will provide a level of guaranteed salary and placement opportunities.” He added: “We remain committed to our longer-term growth plans in the UK including our plan to grow Rotherham into a 2 million tonne green steel hub.” Cheap imports from China, where European producers say lax pollution regulations make the material cheaper to make, are squeezing margins on cheaper steel products such as the thick rebar staves used to reinforce concrete in the construction industry. But Britain is also at a disadvantage to European producers, according to UK Steel, the industry group. It estimates that German producers will pay £107 per megawatt hour of electricity in the coming financial year compared to £174 for UK steel mills. Electric furnaces are seen as the future of many UK steel mills as wind power becomes an increasing part of power supply. The steel sector employs 34,500 people directly in the UK and supports a further 43,000 in supply chains. The jobs are often in areas with few other skilled careers and they offer a salary averaging £37,629, 45pc higher than the UK national average. Alun Davies, Community steelworkers' union national officer, said: “This announcement is a body blow to Liberty Steel’s loyal UK workforce, who couldn’t have done more to get the company through an exceptionally challenging period.” Liberty Steel, the UK’s third-largest steel maker after Tata and British Steel, employs 1,900 people in the UK as well as 5,000 contractors. It said Rotherham could lose 185 jobs, while 121 were at risk in Newport, where the company makes thin plates of steel known as hot rolled coil. West Bromwich could lose 99 jobs, and 35 could be lost in Tredegar in South Wales. Both sites make steel tubes. Liberty was hit by the collapse of Greensill Capital from which it borrowed $5bn (£4.1bn). Mr Gupta’s businesses had borrowed from ventures founded by Australian entrepreneur Lex Greensill, which loaned money to companies short term. It collapsed after one of its insurers refused to renew cover. In November, Liberty reached an understanding with creditors to Lex Greensill’s former lending empire including Swiss bank Credit Suisse, in what it called a major step in refinancing the troubled businesses.",Liberty Steel to make over 400 staff redundant as energy costs hammer industry,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/12/liberty-steel-make-400-staff-redundant-energy-costs-hammer-industry/

Thursday saw several developments in Britain’s many industrial disputes as it emerged the ambulance union will meet next week to consider six more strike days. Staff at more than 150 universities across the country are demanding that employers push up their offer of a 3 per cent pay rise after more than a decade of below-inflation increases, the union said. “The clock is now ticking for the sector to produce a deal or be hit with widespread disruption throughout spring,” UCU general secretary Jo Grady said. Meanwhile, around 100,000 civil servants have also decided to go ahead with a walkout next month after failed talks with the government were dismissed as a “total farce”. Doctors’ unions told health secretary Steve Barclay that he must address the “workforce crisis” at a meeting on Thursday, during which there was no movement on pay demands, while a ballot of a teacher’s union failed to meet the threshold for strike action. Talks aimed at resolving the long-running rail dispute were also set to continue following meetings between unions and employers on Thursday. Further ambulance strikes loom as figures showed emergency response times had fallen to their worst on record, with more than one in 10 people left waiting for paramedics for more than three-and-a-half hours after calling, including with serious illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of damaging the NHS. Speaking in Belfast, he said: “The most important thing is that these strikes are ended. They will only be ended if the government gets in the room and negotiates and so instead of grandstanding, they need to govern.” Mr Barclay was given a “very clear message” that it would not be enough to focus on next year’s NHS settlement with doctors without a shift on current wages, union leaders said. Representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA), hospital doctors’ union the HCSA, and the British Dental Association (BDA) all met Mr Barclay on Thursday at what was described by both sides as a “constructive” meeting. A strike by 100,000 civil servants will go ahead next month after talks with the government aimed at resolving a bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions broke down. Cabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin met with union leaders to discuss growing industrial unrest after weeks of stoppages across the country, including by Border Force staff over Christmas. Unions had made it clear more money would have to be offered to head off an escalation of stoppages. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), said: “This meeting was a total farce. Despite being well-trailed by the government as a chance to resolve the crisis, it was nothing of the sort because the minister had nothing to offer. “He didn’t deny our members were being offered less than anyone else, he didn’t deny tens of thousands of our members only get a pay rise because of the rise in the national minimum wage but he refused to give us a pay rise now.” Nine out of 10 members of the Nasuwt teachers union in England and Wales voted for strikes over pay but the turnout was 42 per cent, falling short of the 50 per cent legal requirement. Nasuwt general secretary Patrick Roach said the union remains “in formal disputes with ministers and employers and will be continuing to take forward our campaigning for a Better Deal for Teachers. He said: “The readiness of our members to support industrial action demonstrates the anger of the profession and the need for governments in England and Wales to engage in meaningful negotiations to address the deep concerns of our members. “Our campaign to fight for the real-terms pay awards that teachers and headteachers deserve continues.” Leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) met separately with the Rail Delivery Group on Thursday. Both sides said detailed discussions were held and they were working towards a revised offer. Strikes have been held since last summer in the row over pay, jobs and conditions, causing huge disruption to services. No more strikes have been called. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said: “We have been in detailed discussions with the Rail Delivery Group for the train operating companies. We are working jointly towards a revised offer for their section of the dispute. “We’ve agreed that over the next couple of days we’ll continue to work on that through discussions, and we’ll see what comes of it.” Additional reporting by Press Association.",University staff to walk out for 18 days as ambulance workers consider further strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/strikes-ambulance-trains-nhs-teachers-b2261200.html

The James Hutton Institute has signed construction contracts with McLaughlin & Harvey worth £28.7m for the next stage of the ongoing redevelopment of its Invergowrie estate. This new contract comprises the construction of a combined Advanced Plant Growth Centre (APGC) and international barley hub (IBH). The new building – with the APGC downstairs and the IBH above – will be full of the latest state-of-the-art scientific equipment. This will include computing facilities, imaging technology, sensor-based systems, robotics and controlled environmental cabinets for growing plants. The project, funded by £62m from the Tay Cities Deal, is part of a masterplan to create two institute-led innovation centres at Invergowrie. It will help establish Scotland as a leader in global food security and crop resilience. Enabling works are ongoing on-site. A number of older buildings are being demolished to make way for the new facility. It will be built in the heart of the Invergowrie Campus and is due to be completed in early 2024. A ‘significant milestone’ for £62m project James Hutton Institute chief executive Colin Campbell hailed a “significant milestone” for the project. He added: “It aims to futureproof the barley sector across Scotland and the UK. “This new facility will serve as the key research hub. “It is set to bring around £60 million benefit and over 1,200 jobs to Scotland over the next 10 years.” UK Government Minister for Scotland Malcolm Offord said the facility will support “the future prosperity of our farming industry”. He also welcomed the creation of jobs in the region. Mr Offord said: “The UK Government is investing £45m at the James Hutton Institute through the Tay Cities Deal. “These new facilities will undertake vital research that will support food security and the future prosperity of our farming industry, while also creating new jobs for the region. McLaughlin & Harvey’s operations director Robbie Clark said the firm was delighted to be working on the project. He said: “Having recently completed the state-of-the-art Barley Field Centre facilities, our highly experienced project team will now move seamlessly on to the delivery of the new Advanced Plant Growth Centre and International Barley Hub.” Newly filed accounts for its commercial arm, James Hutton Limited, show it made pre-tax profits of over £600,000 for the year to March 2022.

At first, there is often outrage that the usual supremacy of bosses over workers has been suspended. Preserving such hierarchies is one of Conservatism’s main aims. But then there is sometimes a sense of opportunity: a belief that the strikers and their supporters may fall into a familiar trap, set by decades of anti-union legislation and press propaganda. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have believed that strikes can be used to make Tory governments look tough, and to discredit Labour and the wider left. The succession of aggressive, deliberately provocative anti-strike measures announced over the last six months by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak all reflect an assumption that taking on the unions is one of the few remaining strategies that might get the Conservatives re-elected. Yet there is also a third, almost forgotten Tory approach to strikes. Before the Thatcher government, her predecessor as Conservative premier, Edward Heath, faced with strikes that, like today’s, were highly disruptive and yet had considerable public support, was sometimes forced to negotiate and make concessions. As the leader of an unpopular government presiding over a fragile economy that the strikes were weakening further, Heath reluctantly accepted that the unions could not all be beaten. The briefly more constructive tone of some of this week’s talks between ministers and union leaders could be a sign that Sunak, too, will ultimately have to concede at least partial victories to some of the strikers. Like Heath, he is not a dominant or charismatic enough prime minister to change the national conversation about strikes and unions, as Thatcher did. His administration could finally mark the beginning of the end for the version of union-bashing Conservatism she invented, which seems increasingly irrelevant to today’s world of poverty wages and modest union memberships. Alternatively, the industrial relations of Sunak’s premiership could be much messier. Like the party he leads – for now, at least – the prime minister’s political thinking is an unstable, quite possibly unsustainable mix, including a desire to be pragmatic and “reasonable”, a dogmatic belief in markets as the best distributors of economic rewards, and an elite remoteness from ordinary working lives. His government’s attitude to the strikes is to be more conciliatory and more confrontational at the same time. Some strikers may be offered one-off bonuses and better pay rises; others, if they refuse to provide so-far-undefined “minimum service” in sectors from health to education may in future be sacked – despite being participants in walkouts that were democratically agreed and wholly legal when launched. For days now, the government has presented this minimum service legislation as an even-handed measure, to “restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption”. But claiming that a better “balance” between trade unionists and the public is required – rather than acknowledging that in millions of cases trade unionists and the public are the same people – has been a partisan Tory ploy for decades. British life has been tilted against unions since the 80s. And the Tories have never shown any interest in balancing the relationship between the public and other, more powerful and disruptive, but right-leaning, economic protagonists, such as the City of London. The disingenuous and vaguely worded minimum service bill also echoes recent draconian legislation aimed partly at road-blocking climate activists, “to balance the rights of protesters against the rights of others to go about their daily business”. Sunak may present himself as a centre-right technocrat, but partly out of panic at the mounting opposition to his government and Conservatism in general, he is increasingly ruling as an authoritarian. The government insists it supports the right to strike. The business secretary, Grant Shapps – often selected to try to make extreme policies sound moderate – said on the BBC’s Today programme earlier this week that the “ideal outcome” of the bill would be for the government “to have the power” to set minimum service levels “and never have to use it”, because unions would voluntarily set their own. But this scenario is less reassuring than it was meant to sound. If strikes in much of the economy are required to come with their own strike-breaking operations, of a size dictated directly or indirectly by the government, something fundamental to workplace politics has been altered. It’s possible that the bill may never become law, since it seems to contravene protections for unions in the European convention on human rights. And even if the legislation survives challenges in the courts, the Commons and the Lords, and on the streets (the TUC has announced a “national right to strike day” on 1 February) it may be hard to implement. Minimum service levels will have to be defined for a vast range of different workplaces, and then enforced without sacking too many essential staff or creating too many union martyrs. Yet to focus on such difficulties, enormous though they are, is to miss part of the point of this latest attack on strikers. Like many Tory policies since and including Brexit, the bill is meant to be symbolic and divisive as much as practical, to create bogeymen and energise Tory supporters. If inflation falls as expected between now and the election, and the strikers’ pay claims therefore seem less justified to many voters, then a continuing anti-union culture war might be timely. Without a Thatcher, fresh rightwing ideas or much remaining administrative energy, today’s Tories probably can’t run a reforming government that really hurts the left – but they can pretend. The problem with this impersonation of radicalism, though, is that it requires enough voters to be taken in. And Johnson’s drifting premiership, Truss’s shambolic tenure and now Sunak’s tone-deaf performance in 10 Downing Street have removed the Conservatives’ credibility as a governing party. Even the union-hating press hasn’t given the minimum service bill as much coverage as you might expect, which suggests uncertainty about its significance. Half a century ago, as well as negotiating with unions, Heath’s government also tried to weaken them through legislation. The 1970 industrial relations bill eventually became law despite huge protests. But it was widely flouted, and he lost the next election. If you’re a struggling Tory prime minister, victories on paper over the workers probably won’t save you.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded an increase of 0.1% as the services sector remained in growth despite the soaring cost of living. Experts at the ONS said the slight rise was supported by the technology sector and a strong showing by pubs and bars amid a boost from the winter World Cup in Qatar. It nevertheless represented a slowdown in growth after GDP increased by 0.5% in October. Analysts had predicted the economy would shrink by 0.3% for November. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy grew a little in November, with increases in telecommunications and computer programming helping to push the economy forward. “Pubs and bars also did well as people went out to watch World Cup games. “This was partially offset by further falls in some manufacturing industries, including the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, as well as falls in transport and postal, partially due to the impact of strikes. “Over the last three months, however, the economy still shrank – mainly due to the impact of the extra bank holiday for the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in September.” Consumer-facing industries were the biggest growth driver of the month, witnessing a 0.4% increase amid a lift from higher food and drink sales during the World Cup. The service sector also grew by 0.2% as more punters visited pubs and other venues, although this still reflected a slowdown from a 0.7% rise a month earlier. In November, the construction sector saw growth fall away as it stayed flat for the month following a 0.4% rise in October. Elsewhere, manufacturing was the main cause of a 0.2% decline in the production sector for the period. The ONS added that GDP still contracted by 0.3% over the three months to November despite the latest growth. The economy also declined by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2022 and would therefore enter a technical recession if a further fall is recorded for the final quarter of the year. Economists have suggested that the latest data makes it less clear whether the UK will have entered a recession at the end of last year. Kitty Usher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “This is stronger activity than was expected for November and so will further contribute to the improvement in market sentiment we have seen in the last few weeks. “Given we know the economy also grew in October – albeit driven by a rebound from the period of state mourning – it is no longer certain that the economy will meet the technical definition of a recession when the final data for 2022 is in.” It comes as inflation started to cool down in November, dropping to 10.7% from a 41-year-high of 11.1% a month earlier, and it is expected to drop further through 2023. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said: “We have a clear plan to halve inflation this year – an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world. “To support families through this tough patch, we will provide an average of £3,500 support for every household over this year and next – but the most important help we can give is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year so we get the economy growing again.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow Chancellor, said: “Today’s results are just another page in the book of failure that is the Tory record on growth. “The news of further economic pain will be deeply concerning to families already struggling with the soaring cost of living.”",UK economy unexpectedly grows in November,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/gdp-jeremy-hunt-rachel-reeves-institute-of-directors-b2261459.html

The winning bids were revealed in a joint announcement by the UK and Scottish governments. The special economic zones north of the border are being created under a scheme agreed by the two governments. The successful applicants will be able to offer tax incentives and lower tariffs in the zones. A total of five bids for green freeport status were submitted, with North East Scotland, Orkney and Clyde missing out. Each had to set out how they would regenerate their area, create high-quality jobs and support transition to a net-zero economy. The Forth Green Freeport bid was led by Forth Ports, which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland. In submitting its bid, Forth Ports said it had the potential to create up to 50,000 new, high-quality jobs in renewable energy, manufacturing, sustainable fuels and construction. Its activities will focus on renewables, advanced manufacturing, alternative fuels, carbon capture utilisation and storage, shipbuilding, logistics and the creative industries. The Opportunity Cromarty Firth consortium - backed by Port of Cromarty Firth, Global Energy Group, Highland Resources and Port of Inverness - said it could create 25,000 jobs. The Inverness and Cromarty Firth bid aims to build a ""world-beating"" floating offshore wind manufacturing sector, with sites in the Cromarty Firth, Invergordon, Nigg and Inverness. Also called free trade zones, freeports are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in a zone receive tax waivers or tax breaks on National Insurance contributions, Land and Buildings Transactions Tax, business rates and capital allowances. The Scottish ""green freeport"" model includes commitments to meeting net zero targets and supporting fair work practices. The UK government has committed funding of £52m to the project and bidders had to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. Scotland's deputy first minister, John Swinney, described the creation of green freeports as a ""milestone achievement"". He said: ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport and Forth Green Freeport will support businesses to create high-quality, well-paid new jobs, promote growth and regeneration, and make a significant contribution to achieving our net zero ambitions. ""The successful applicants showed a strong determination to embed fair work practices, including payment of the Real Living Wage, and to enshrine net zero initiatives in their work. ""We look forward to working closely with them to ensure they deliver maximum positive impact and become operational as soon as possible."" The UK government's Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the green freeports would ""undoubtedly be transformative for future generations"". He added: ""Scotland has areas of outstanding opportunity but there are also places that can benefit from more investment to truly level up communities that have been overlooked. ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Firth of Forth are fantastic areas for these new green freeports to set up, ensuring the benefits are felt right across Scotland. ""This will help to create exciting new jobs, boost business and encourage investment in the local areas and beyond."" Scottish Renewables said it was pleased that the freeports would have green energy as a focus. Its head of energy transition and supply chain, Emma Harrick, said they would ""help Scotland compete on the international stage as offshore wind develops to become the mainstay of electricity generation in the UK"". The Scottish and UK governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border, after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later said they would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. The SNP's partners in government - the Scottish Greens - do not support the freeports, arguing they are likely to result in ""greenwashing"" rather than genuine action on sustainability. Greens MSP Ross Greer described freeports as a ""Thatcherite gimmick"" and voiced concern about potential abuse by criminals. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""We've consistently across the world seen freeports attract a lot of criminal activity, particularly money laundering and smuggling, because of the customs arrangements that are in place for them, because they are about deregulation, they are about making it 'easier', particularly for international trade."" Paul Swinney, director of policy research for think tank Centre for Cities, said it remained to be seen how much impact the new freeports would have. He said: ""With freeports, the government has dressed it up as saying we are going to make them into centres of innovation and hotbeds of new ideas. ""But the reality is that the tools that are that on offer make these schemes very attractive to low-skilled businesses rather than high-skilled businesses.""",Cromarty Firth and Forth to host first green freeports,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64248082?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

The Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) bid is a collaboration of more than a dozen organisations representing industry, academia and the public sector around the Easter Ross and Inverness area. The aim is to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity in manufacturing, and from local and inward investment, innovation, skills development and employment. READ MORE: Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport officially confirmed by Scottish and UK Governments The OCF area has been highlighted as the main location for the UK to benefit from floating wind manufacturing. Reacting to the news, HIE’s chief executive Stuart Black, said: “We congratulate Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) on their successful bid. This is fantastic news. “Our collective belief in the region and the key ports’ capacity and capability to play an essential role in offshore wind and green hydrogen delivery has been confirmed by the dedication, commitment and resolve shown by the bid partners. ""This paves the way for even greater industry collaboration. The consortium’s physical assets, natural resources, experienced supply chain, and can-do people have proven to be a winning combination that can lead to future success. “The Highlands and Islands will play a critical role in meeting the challenging net zero targets at both Scotland and UK levels. Green freeport status for the Cromarty Firth will be a huge asset, driving collaboration between industry, academia and the public sector to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity, investment, innovation and skills development. “It will attract large-scale manufacturing and create thousands of green jobs that complement the skills of the local workforce and accelerate Scotland’s and the UK’s progress to achieving net zero targets. “A green freeport will also build on recent significant investments made in ports and harbours across the region and the historic and ongoing strengths here in energy, engineering and life sciences. “It will be a key enabler for supply chains of the future, rapidly accelerating domestic manufacturing capacity in an area with a long-standing industrial heritage. “We very much look forward to our region working in partnership with OCF, as we seek to secure maximum socio-economic impact, not just around the Cromarty Firth and Inverness but throughout many parts of the Highlands and Islands.” Sheelagh Cooley, real estate partner in the Edinburgh office of law firm Shoosmiths, also welcomed the successful bid. She said: “The confirmation of two green freeports in Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Forth represents an opportunity to drive forward new development, regeneration and economic growth in Scotland. “The potential impact of these projects, however, must not be limited to the immediate vicinity of the green freeports. Rather, true success hinges on the ability to also revitalise surrounding towns and cities, many of which are economically deprived. “In Inverness and Cromarty Firth, the introduction of a green freeport is said to have the potential to unlock £2.5bn of new private sector investment – creating up to 25,000 jobs. This is alongside developing wind power technology, with its port facilities already supporting offshore wind projects. “While the introduction of green freeports is governed by UK legislation, the model’s legislative structure is subject to devolved and reserved powers. The sites are intended to be secure custom zones where business can be carried out inside a land border, but where different custom and tax rules apply - offering various regulatory and financial incentives. “From a planning perspective, the green freeports are likely to operate under extended permitted development rights. Combined with a streamlining of the consenting process for development, this type of relaxed planning regime could, in theory, allow schemes – residential, commercial and infrastructure - to be brought forward at speed and avoiding certain barriers. “Unlike the UK government’s freeport model, and investment zone proposals, Scottish green freeports are subject to additional requirements, including on carbon neutrality and paying the real Living Wage. “The Forth green freeport could act as a catalyst for the manufacture of offshore wind turbines, shipbuilding and energy systems. It encompasses several ports, industrial and logistics sites, as well as Edinburgh Airport, with the consortium behind the bid outlining that it could lead to a boom in job creation and economic growth that is rooted in renewable energy and decarbonisation. “The successful bidders will now work with the Scottish and UK Government to determine a governance structure for each site. A process that must balance deregulation and economic growth with protecting the environment and assisting the transition to net zero. “Subject to compliance with the regulatory controls, green freeports should provide a welcome opportunity for growth in the Scottish economy, especially in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.” Dr Liz Cameron CBE, Chief Executive, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, also welcomed the award. She said: “It is great news for Scottish business that the UK and Scottish Governments have finally confirmed the sites of the two winning bids. It’s important now that both governments act swiftly to ensure that the successful sites are operational at the earliest opportunity, we are all competing to attract investment and trade. “Whilst it will be very disappointing for those areas who were not successful, we would urge both governments to now consider, in partnership with the business community, other incentives and initiatives which could be developed from the innovation demonstrated by the other bidders.” Professor Chris O’Neil, principal and chief executive of UHI Inverness, said: “The awarding of Green Freeport status to Inverness and Cromarty Firth will have a transformative impact on the economic fortunes of the community we serve. ""We are poised, together with our UHI partners, to meet the subsequent skills and knowledge demand. “We have the expertise in engineering, research, technology, design and construction to provide a highly-skilled and aspirational workforce, including trainees, apprentices, graduates and researchers. “As well as being well-placed to meet the associated need for talent, we also have the established industry links and capacity for knowledge exchange to make valuable collaborative contributions to the creation of a global green hub. “Our talented and committed students have proved their resilience by studying while coping with the consequences of a pandemic and then a cost-of-living crisis, and this announcement is significant in that it represents an improved future and enhanced opportunities for many of them. “Current and upcoming students will complete their learning journey knowing there is the potential for attractive employment on our doorstep in an expanding industry. These prospects will help retain local talent and will also appeal to a generation of students who are environmentally conscious and willing to embrace a sector that supports their values.” Do you want to respond to this article?

Josh Self,87322068,https://www.politics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PA-68183790.jpg,en,2023-01-13 16:13:37,-0.024,GB,"Rishi Sunak is a hyper-aware, even self-conscious prime minister. Since taking post in October, he has worked assiduously to present a “slick” image to the media, undertaken multiple U-turns to halt backbench rebellions and tried at every turn to position himself positively against Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer. The tricky technocrat in No 10 is obsessed with good press. It is an approach that bares stark contrast to the days of Liz Truss, who showed little concern for how her policies might be received amid her deeply misguided ideological crusade. Unlike his predecessor, therefore, you can take for granted that when Sunak announces a new policy, there will be a hefty amount of calculated politicking involved. In this way, November’s Autumn Statement was strategically orientated to exploit traditional Conservative strengths and traditional Labour weaknesses. Sir Keir, ever-keen to present Labour as a responsible party after the Cobrynite experiment, was challenged to disagree with Sunak’s proposals. In the end, Labour’s inability to sign up wholeheartedly to the new fiscal orthodoxy exposed, in chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s analysis, a deficit of common sense in Labour ranks. When it comes to the government’s new anti-strike bill, the political thinking is essentially the same. Setting a trap… The new anti-strike legislation was introduced to the House on Tuesday by business secretary Grant Shapps. Citing risks posed to NHS patients, Shapps outlined that the new bill would require public sector services to run minimum levels of provision on strike days — essentially forcing a certain proportion of an industry to work or face the sack. The move harks back to a “golden age” of Conservative power over industrial relations. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have viewed strikes as a way to make their party look tough and discredit the Labour Party alongside the wider left. To be sure, we have already seen Starmer encounter some political difficulty in this latest wave of industrial action. In the summer, he chose to sack one-time frontbencher Sam Tarry for standing alongside picketing workers. For the Labour leader — intent on distancing his party from the unions — Tarry had crossed a very literal red line. But even if Starmer wants to downplay the connection, there is no escaping the fact that the Labour party is associated politically and financially with the trade union movement. With the new anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak hopes to implicate Labour in an upsurge of union militancy, thus slowing Starmer’s inexorable march towards Downing Street. It was telling that ministers chose to announce the new strike legislation within hours of the Labour leader’s “New year, New Vision” speech last week. Shapps’ pledge stole Starmer’s limelight and Labour’s newly announced “take back control bill” secured a grand total of zero newspaper front pages the following day. The politics of the new legislation also dominated Starmer’s post-speech press conference. Under a barrage of questioning, the Labour leader confirmed that his party will vote against the plans and repeal the Act if he takes power at the next election. It was all going to plan for Sunak. He had goaded Starmer out of hiding and forced the Labour leader to share an ideological platform with that favourite Conservative bogeyman: the so-called union “baron”. The PMQs’ attack lines wrote themselves. However, few would deny that the prime minister is playing a high-stakes political game with his new anti-strike bill. Although Starmer’s reaction could be accounted for, the government risks running into a hostile public backlash. Now a week on from when the legislation was announced, and many view the new proposals as needlessly and deliberately obstructive. Risk 1: The government is viewed as needlessly obstructive Although Conservative MPs imagine Mick Lynch as the new Arthur Scargill, the infamous union “baron” who led opposition to Margaret Thatcher, the general public is not so convinced. Instead, the political posturing around the new anti-strike bill may be viewed as deepening the industrial relations crisis and prolonging our winter of discontent. Furthermore, the new bills’ parliamentary progress is set to be slow, with a difficult House of Lords stage beckoning. And when/if the bill does eventually pass, its key provisions will unquestionably be tested in the courts before they can take effect, just as is the case with deportations to Rwanda. So with the proposed legislation unlikely to do anything to solve urgent disputes, the public may well wonder want the point is at all — if not to be deliberately coercive and punitive. Risk 2: Labour exploits support for striking nurses Another risk for Sunak is that by focussing on risks posed to NHS patients during the strikes, he ventures onto territory where the Labour Party is traditionally at its strongest. It is telling that Starmer has focused his attacks on the part of the bill which would allow employers to sack workers who defy a “work notice” by striking. At PMQs on Wednesday, Starmer accused the government of going from “clapping the nurses to sacking the nurses”. On Thursday came a new widely-shared graphic by order of Labour Party HQ, which accused Sunak of planning to give striking nurses “the finger”, Alan Sugar-style. This attack line works because it is not very far from the truth. As a result of the proposed law, individual nurses could be prosecuted and even jailed. These are the same people Sunak was pictured clapping for, as chancellor, throughout the pandemic. Risk 3: Sunak is viewed as a rigid, uncompromising ideologue Sunak’s desire to be seen as pragmatic and “reasonable” may be fundamentally undermined by the passage of this bill. In pursuing the new legislation, Sunak has abandoned his “managerialism” and political prudence, territory where the risk-averse Starmer is comfortable, in order to set up a battle over principles, territory where Starmer is not. Honing in on fundamental Labour-Conservative differences in a bid to exploiting the Labour leader’s risk-averse nature, Sunak hence risks exposing the worst aspects of Conservative ideology. While the prime minister may point to a more conciliatory tone in negotiations, there is no hiding that the new law is an act of explicitly Thatcherite homage. It is as provocative and divisive as much as practically possible, drawing on Conservatism’s collective memory of disputes in the 1980s. However, you cannot help but think that in picking a fight with NHS nurses, Sunak has chosen the wrong moment to abandon his “problem-solving” priorities and get dug in with Conservative dogma. One recent YouGov poll found that 64% of the public support the striking nurses. Rather than introducing anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak’s political future may be better served by getting around the negotiating table and constructively ending the industrial dispute once and for all. So with imagery of nurses in handcuffs circling — and with ordinary Britons desperate for some degree of normalcy to return, Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes looks destined to fail.",Week-in-Review: Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes is destined to fail,https://www.politics.co.uk/week-in-review/2023/01/13/week-in-review-sunaks-attempt-to-trap-starmer-on-strikes-is-destined-to-fail/

As energy experts focused on how data can be used in the transition to a low-carbon economy, we have closely followed how this volatility has played out in Britain. Full data for the year 2022 is now available and here are a few things we have noticed. Britain (we talk about Britain and not the UK, as Northern Ireland is part of an integrated Irish electricity grid) saw a 4% drop in electricity demand from 2021 – that’s the third largest year-on-year reduction after 2008 (caused by the shock of the global financial crash) and pandemic-affected 2020. It takes Britain’s overall electricity demand back to values last seen in the 1980s, an 18% reduction from its peak in 2005. This time two years ago, we stated that COVID lockdowns meant electricity demand would never be so low again. We got it wrong. In fact, 2022 was the lowest year by some margin (2% lower than 2020). We believe the main factors for this drop were the significant increase in prices, the wider media attention on this, and the wider cost of living crisis. From importer to exporter The earliest undersea high-voltage direct current cable (known as an interconnector) from Britain to another country’s power grid was laid in 1961 across the Strait of Dover to France. In the years since, another seven have been constructed: two to Ireland, one to Belgium, one to the Netherlands, one to Norway and a further two to France. More interconnectors are under construction or proposed, including a connection with Denmark due to go live at the end of 2023. Since 1978, Britain has always used these cables to import more electricity than it exported over a given year. Over the past decade, an average of 5% of the country’s electricity has been imported, helping to reduce the amount it needed to generate itself. However, net imports swung to net exports in 2022 for the first time in 44 years. Looking at the individual interconnectors, it was the link to France that caused this significant change. In 2021, there were 14 terawatt-hours (TWh) of net imports from France whereas in 2022, there were 10 TWh to France. This is an enormous swing of 24 TWh from a single point of connection, and represents the largest annual change in a single electricity source since the shift from coal to gas in 2015/16. To put 24 TWh in context, this is broadly similar to the amount of electricity Scotland uses each year, or the annual output from Britain’s onshore wind generation. So what happened? Over the past year, French nuclear power stations had many maintenance problems which led to significant reductions in their output. In August, 57% of the country’s generation capacity was not being used. Despite a modest recovery, as of January 2023, 15 of its 56 reactors were closed for repairs. All this meant nuclear-reliant France had to import electricity from neighbouring countries. This led to more electricity being generated in Britain than would otherwise have been the case, to satisfy the additional demand from France. So while Britain’s renewable generation was at a record level, its fossil fuel generation was also higher than in the previous year. Without the problems in France, 2022 could have been the first year that Britain’s wind, solar and hydro combined generated more electricity than its fossil fuels – a milestone that will happen anyway over the next couple of years. Wind is cheap, but your electricity isn’t Wind generation also recovered from its relatively poor output in 2021 to reach a record generation of 77 TWh. That’s a 24% increase on the preceding year, when capacity increased by just 11%. This sudden increase highlights the year-to-year variations that need to be planned for to have a robust and resilient decarbonised power system, including longer duration energy storage. Renewables (including generation from biomass) contributed nearly 40% of Britain’s total generation in 2022. This progress, along with the lower demand for electricity within Britain, meant emissions from the power sector were broadly similar to previous years (though would have been lower if imports from France had continued). The rising prices of electricity and gas have contributed to a cost of living crisis, putting millions in fuel poverty. And though renewables and nuclear together provided over half of Britain’s electricity in 2022, the system is still overwhelmingly influenced by prices set by fossil fuel plants. Reforms are urgently needed here to decouple the price of low-carbon electricity from that of fossil fuels.",Britain is a net electricity exporter for first time in 44 years,https://theconversation.com/britain-is-a-net-electricity-exporter-for-first-time-in-44-years-197506

The Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the BBC's Today programme and the rest of the doomsters may be convinced that we face some terrible economic apocalypse. But the facts refuse to oblige. Confounding all expectations, output in Britain grew by 0.1pc in November, leading financial analyst across the City to upgrade forecasts. That means we're not in a recession after all. And it could get even better when we see the official December data. In spite of all the doom and gloom about a disastrous seasonal shopping season British consumers did what they do best and opened their wallets. The result? Retail sales soared — right in the midst of the 'cost of living crisis'. Growth in November was driven by the UK's resilient services sector — everything from haircuts and shopping malls to the banks and legal services of the City, as well as entertainment and communications. It accounts for nearly 79 per cent of our national output. (Construction was flat, hindered by rising interest rates, while manufacturing dipped.) So in spite of months of bad news from Downing Street in the form of tax hikes and budget cuts — as well as a seemingly never-ending stream of headlines about soaring energy bills, rampant inflation and relentless strike actions — Christmas 2022 brought excellent economic news. From the high street to the retail park, sales were brisk. Shopping boomed across the country, with almost every category in the sector — be it supermarket groceries, beauty products at Boots, or Nike Air Force trainers — keeping the tills rattling throughout the festive period. Marks & Spencer, far from being the busted flush of popular imagination, saw turkeys and sparkling wine help to deliver a 6.3 per cent gain in sales through its food halls. Mid-market Sainsbury's, thought to be a victim of competition from German value retailers Aldi and Lidl, also defied the odds with a 7.1 per cent rise in sales over Christmas. High street giants Tesco, Next and Lidl have all done impressively, too. as have local favourites Greggs and Boots. Corks were also popping at the UK's biggest wine retailer Majestic, where price cuts brought shoppers through the doors in droves. Stunningly, sales were 21.1 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. JD Sports, meanwhile, recorded a 20 per cent lift in sales over the holiday period, driven by 2.6 million pairs of Nike trainers. But it's not just shops. In aviation, passenger numbers at Heathrow were up 90 per cent on the 2021 festive period — when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 blighted festive getaways — defying industrial action by border staff. Elsewhere, in spite of this week's aborted Virgin Orbit launch in Cornwall, the UK's space sector is booming, with Germany's Rocket Factory Augsburg signing a multi-year partnership for a planned launch on the Shetland Islands. The industry generates £16.5 billion of income. And, in another boost, this week's news of a gas find in the southern North Sea by a Shell-led consortium has been hailed as 'fantastic'. The good tidings continue. The Office for National Statistics reported this week that, in 2021, UK output per hour worked 'had the fastest growth of the G7 countries'. Not something likely to lead BBC headlines. Banking giant JP Morgan Chase says that about three-quarters of its mid-size UK business leaders (the backbone of our economy) plan to grow their enterprises this year — and have no plans to shed jobs. So, when all this is accounted for, and despite all the dire talk from the Bank of England and others about the longest recession in our history, things could be turning out far better than expected. And saying this matters. Because drumbeats of bad economic forecasts can fast become self-perpetuating, ramping up the gloom and helping to delay our recovery. Even Doomster-in-Chief — Chancellor Jeremy Hunt — now believes that the economic slow-down will be milder than forecast. So why isn't he — and, indeed, our glum Prime Minister — leading by example and shouting the positive news from the rooftops? After all, it is the Conservative Party's 'energy price guarantee' on people's bills (established under the Liz Truss debacle and largely embraced by Sunak and Hunt), along with targeted help for the poorest families unveiled by Sunak when he was still at the Treasury, that together have taken the sting out of household gas and electricity costs. And that's in addition to the recent sharp fall in the price of wholesale gas, as a result of the extraordinarily mild European winter — one of the warmest in half a century. This has reduced demand and lowered tariffs, further helping to cut the cost of living. Yet despite these successes, Nos 10 and 11 have echoed the pessimistic economists who were still insisting at the end of last year that consumers as well as retailers were bound to suffer badly this winter. The British Retail Consortium's Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said in early December that 'the cost of living crisis means many families might dial back their festive plans'. She could not have been more wrong. It's clear then that, while cost pressures are real, people have not stopped spending. How is this possible? Amid the purported misery, it seems families are still determined to enjoy themselves. My view is that the soothsayers have underestimated two post-pandemic factors. That big savings balances approaching £200 billion, built-up during the pandemic, have been sitting around ready to be spent. And that, ahead of the holidays, fewer credit cards had been swiped to their limits than in previous years. The British Retail Consortium continues to warn that because of further rises in the cost of living, retailers face headwinds in 2023. Maybe so. But inflation is forecast to fall dramatically, wholesale gas prices have tumbled and the employment market remains strong, with more than 1 million vacancies. The pessimism is being overdone. There is still some way to go, but that should not preclude our leaders hailing the resilience of the British consumer, or the skill with which industries across the board managing their way through difficult times.

The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said the new strike days are in addition to the previously announced 16-day programme of rolling strike action, set to begin in schools across the country next week. The EIS Executive Committee met on Friday and agreed action that will include two days of strikes in all schools and sectors on February 28 and March 1, followed by a rolling programme of strikes for 20 days between March 13 and April 21. Each local authority area will be impacted by three consecutive days of strikes, with one day affecting all schools bookended on either side by one-day strikes in primary and secondary schools. EIS members have previously taken three days of strikes, one in November and two in January, in the continuing campaign for a fair pay settlement for the year 2022. Primary and secondary schools were closed on Tuesday January 10 and Wednesday January 11 after last-ditch talks with the Scottish Government failed. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. Speaking after the meeting of EIS Executive Committee, general secretary Andrea Bradley said: “The programme of additional strike action, agreed today, is a direct response to the inaction of the Scottish Government and Cosla (Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) on teacher pay. “After a year of dither, delay and disingenuity from the Scottish Government and Cosla, Scotland’s teachers have simply had enough.” Ms Bradley added: “The recent days of strike action by Scotland’s teachers have succeeded in bringing Cosla and the Scottish Government back to the negotiating table but they have yet to put a single extra penny onto that table. “Scotland’s teachers rejected a sub-inflationary 5% offer six months ago, and little or no progress has been made in negotiations since. “The prospect of 22 additional days of strike action, on top of the 16 days of rolling action set to begin next week, should signal clearly to the Scottish Government and Cosla that they must now act with urgency. “Our members are resolute and determined to secure a fair pay settlement, which both properly reflects their value and also takes account of the soaring cost of living.” Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “Strikes in our schools are in no one’s interest – including for pupils, parents and carers who have already had to deal with significant disruption over the past three years. “It is disappointing that the EIS has proceeded to escalate industrial action – we are continuing to urge teaching unions to reconsider their plans while talks are ongoing. “Recent discussions have been constructive. There has been a shared understanding that talks have been focused on discussing potential areas for compromise – not on tabling a new offer at this stage. “To date we have made four offers, all of which have been rejected, but we remain absolutely committed to reaching an agreement on a pay deal that is fair and sustainable for all concerned.”",Teaching union announces 22 more days of strike action in Scotland,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-government-scotland-children-education-secretary-b2261914.html

It began in 2005 as a groundbreaking show which featured some of the country's best young business minds hoping to secure a job with the then Sir Alan. However the programme has slowly turned into a more reality TV-inspired fare, with big personalities gloating irreverently about their skills in business. Among them are two sweetshop owners, two hairdressers, a martial arts instructor, and a pest control company owner and they will be put through their paces through a series of tricky tasks, with the first set in Antigua. The 20th anniversary of the series will air next year, with Lord Sugar saying he would do 20 years and then retire, having invested over £3million of his own money over the years. Meet all 18 candidates hoping to secure an investment for their business ideas. AVI SHARMA 'Some say I'm delusional, I prefer the term optimistic.' Avi is this year's youngest candidate, and works as a city banker in London. He describes himself as 'confident' and 'optimistic' and says he can 'bring a smile to the most miserable face!' He wants Lord Sugar's investment to help get him out of the 'rat race' of a banking job, boasting: 'I'm the hardest working rat he'll ever meet.' BRADLEY JOHNSON 'I have a business plan that will see us turn over seven figures after year three and who knows where else that could take us.' Bradley is a self-made businessman, who is the director of a construction company in North Yorkshire. He prides himself on his work ethic and drive which he claims has allowed him to create a business that turns over half-a-million after being made redundant just four years ago. He admits that his biggest weakness is public speaking, confessing: 'I was always the shy kid at school, I hated having to stand up and read in English lesson'. DANI DONOVAN 'My biggest weakness is also my biggest strength.' Dani owns a hair salon in Hertfordshire, which she started as a teenager and believes the key to business is 'passion'. She says she has a 'unique' personality and describes herself as 'a different kind of business owner, which is a lot more relatable to people.' Her self-confessed weakness, is 'that nothing is ever good enough and that I always want more. This is a weakness because then I'm never content with what I have achieved. But it's also a humongous strength – it is what has pushed me to come so far.' She believes she deserves to win the programme because her business fills a 'huge gap' in the market, saying: 'It baffles me that no one has done it yet!' DENISHA KAUR BHARJ 'I have always known what I wanted in life. I know the dreams I want to achieve. There's only one Denisha Kaur.' Denisha works as a financial controller in Leicestershire and says she's not afraid of getting out of her comfort zone. She describes herself as 'strong, motivated and hard-working' and says she can work under pressure, overcoming both professional and personal tests to reach success. Denisha says she wants the investment opportunity because she wants to 'be mentored by the best to be the best.' She argues she deserves it, because: 'I'm a woman who wants to create an empire and have it all; to be able to provide for my family and to be an inspiration to young women. I dream big, but I work extra hard and know everything is possible.' EMMA BROWNE 'I am disgustingly competitive. I will go to any lengths to win this investment.' Emma is a senior account executive in County Kildare and says she is 'extremely competitive' and a 'workaholic' who will 'do anything succeed'. She has over five years of hands-on sales experience and says she wants to ensure she will win tasks by being honest about her opinions. Describing her business idea, she says: 'I am confident that whether I win the investment from Lord Sugar or not, I am going to make my company one of the most successful ideas to ever come out of The Apprentice. Watch this space. GREGORY EBBS 'My biggest weakness, some could call a strength in my opinion, is sometimes being a little too unusual.' Gregory is the owner of an online antiques marketplace based in Shropshire and is also a local coucillor, while he previously worked as a professional cannon-firer. He says his USP is 'my ability to think outside the box and try out new and different things' and confesses to being 'slightly more unusual than most'. He says: 'I would say, a willingness to try different things and not being afraid to be slightly different is one of my biggest strengths. Speaking on his business idea, Gregory said: 'I think the chances of making this business super successful is greater than anybody else’s, because it’s such a fantastic principle.' JOSEPH PHILLIPS 'If Lord Sugar wants to invest in a business to help save the ocean, one lip balm at a time, then I’m his guy.' Joseph is a safari guide in South Africa, from Worcestshire and he believes that gives him the edge to be 'unique enough to succeed in the process', describing himself as the 'James Bond of the business world'. He admits that his biggest weakness is his dyslexia and say he 'struggled to keep my head above water' at school and keep up with his peers. But Joseph said the diagnosis has now become a driving force to succeed and go further as he wanted to prove that you can still be anything you want to be with dyslexia. He graciously adds: 'I don’t deserve Lord Sugar’s investment more than anyone else in the process, but I do think I have something that they don’t.' KEVIN D'ARCY 'With Lord Sugar as my business partner, I know we can ride that wave into the UK and beyond…' Kevin is an accountant from Dublin who began his water sports equipment business during lockdown while juggling his job. He claims his business has turned over just under half a million in two years and says that combined with his 10-year career in financial service sets him apart from the rest. Kevin admits his biggest weakness to be: 'I can be a little outspoken, so probably not knowing when to shut up.' MARK MOSELEY 'If Lord Sugar doesn’t pick me, then he’s missing a trick.' Mark is the owner of a pest control company in London, arguing that Lord Sugar can invest because the industry is worth hundreds of millions of pounds a year in the UK. He is also a former soldier who has worked all over the world in remote and hostile environments, meaning he should be right at home in the boardroom. He describes himself as 'very talkative with the charm to match – I can sell to anyone' and claims to have met celebrities and members of the royal family. Mark confesses he can be 'a little bit over-confident from time to time' but explains that 'people buy into confidence'. MARNIE SWINDELLS 'I have fought tooth and nail to get to where I am today with my business.' Marnie is a court advocate in London who is also a gold medal-winning boxer and imaginative businesswoman who is ready to face off against the other candidates. She says her USP is her 'imagination and creativity' but admits her passion and eagerness can sometimes translate as being too 'headstrong'. She says she deserves Lord Sugar's investment because: 'I think that taking the experience I have in the boxing industry and all the experience that he has in the business industry, together we would be a winning combination.' MEGAN HORNBY 'I think that no matter what situation I am thrown into, I will always give one hundred percent truth, even if it’s hard to hear.' Megan is the owner of a sweet shop and café in East Yorkshire and says her business has a 'real niche' in a gap in the market. She says her biggest asset is her honesty, saying it's the 'most important thing in business'. Her biggest weakness is her ambition, confessing: 'I can take too many things on, and sometimes I need to focus on certain aspects.' She says she should have the £250k because: 'I really think that with Lord Sugar’s investment, my business could be nationally recognised'. REECE DONNELLY 'I'm going to be turning over a million pounds before I’m thirty.' Reece is the owner of a performing arts school in Glasgow who is determined to become the first Scottish candidate to secure Lord Sugar's investment. He says he is the youngest CEO of a further education college in the UK and says he has 'all the experience, drive, and personality' to succeed. He admits that he can be guilty of neglecting the grunt work, saying: 'Admin or accounting tasks aren’t quite for me' but that this makes him a better leader who is able to delegate. Reece says he wants to prove: 'Scotland is filled with forward-thinking entrepreneurs and that we are not in fact a haggis-eating, kilt-wearing nation.' ROCHELLE ANTHONY 'I’m always being compared to the Kim Kardashian of the business world because I’m doing business with a hint of glam.' Rochelle owns a hair salon and academy in Bedfordshire and has compared herself to Kim Kardashian in the business world. She describes herself as 'tenacious, fierce and determined' and says together with Lord Sugar they would be 'an absolute force to be reckoned with.' According to Rochelle, her biggest weakness is she doesn't like the word 'no' and can't let go, instead turning it into a 'not yet', but learns from her mistakes. SHANNON MARTIN 'Lord Sugar needs to be my next business partner, so I can make him millions.' Shannon is the owner of bridal boutique from West Yorkshire and is hoping to be the first business partner to bring Lord Sugar into the lucrative bridal industry. She admits she struggles to prioritise and plan because 'I want everything now' and that it can cause a bit of stress. She believes she deserves the investment because: 'There are not many other businesses that design, and manufacture wedding dresses made solely in the UK, which is exactly what my business plan is.' SHAZIA HUSSAIN 'I don’t need any friends in business. I am here to win this.' Shazia is a technology recruiter in London and wants to inspire a varied representation of diverse women in the world of business. She says her ADHD is both her USP and biggest weakness, saying she can process information faster, react quicker and see things differently, but can lose concentration quickly. She says she should get the win because: 'It’s important to see a varied representation of women, including women with neurodiversity in business, as people with neurodiversity are linked to being increasingly successful within the corporate sector. I hope that I’ll encourage more people like me not to be ashamed of their difference.' SIMBA RWAMBIWA 'My USP is myself. If people can’t buy into you, they’ll never buy anything from you.' Simba is a senior sales representative from Birmingham and says he's a perfectionist as he always wants to 'get things right'. He says he deserves the investment opportunity because his business guarantee prpfit, 'but also guarantees to improve the quality of peoples’ lives'. SOHAIL CHOWHARY 'I am calm and collected, but if they do come at me? I will bite and I will sting, and I will leave my mark.' Sohail owns a martial arts school in Southampton and wants the otehr candidates to be 'wary' of him. He says his biggest asset is 'turning my laziness into a positive by creating smart solutions and simple shortcuts to difficult problems.' He admits his biggest weakness is not listening to others when 'on the very rare occasion I might be wrong' but says: 'I’ll always be the person that looks out for the little guy and sometimes that means that I will put emotions before business.' Sohail is proud to have grown up in a council house and worked his way up and adds: 'Owning a martial arts business means Lord Sugar can learn how to kick ass for free.'

In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay.

Around half of Britain’s railway lines are closed and only a fifth of services are running as tens of thousands of workers at Network Rail and train operators walk out on the second day of the strike with bus drivers joining them. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction and said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline,” he wrote. Transport for London has revealed that bus strikes will take place today and tomorrow on Abellio bus services. There will still be buses available on the affected routes in south and west London, but not in their usual numbers.

It wasn’t until this past year watching Musk, Johnson, Trump, King Charles, Truss, Clarkson (who is not out of the woods, however much cover The Sun give him) etc that it occurred to me that, if you are patient enough and prepared to witness massive collateral damage and waste of resources and unnecessary heartache, worsening socio-economic inequality and the debasement of living conditions for the most vulnerable – “they” implode...

Please send your letters to letters@independent.co.uk Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 03:30 1672800480 What does Britain really think about the strikes? Rishi Sunak has been warned that his “high risk” strategy on public sector pay rises could backfire, as an exclusive poll for The Independent showed strong public support for fresh strikes in 2023. Almost two in three voters would back NHS nurses taking more strike action next year if their pay demands are not met, the Savanta poll found, with only 24 per cent opposed. In addition, more voters expressed support for fresh industrial action by rail staff, bus drivers, postal workers and teachers than those who said they were opposed to further strikes. Adam Forrest reports: What does Britain really think about the strikes? As unions and government continue their stand-off, voters are still backing the workers who have chosen to walk out, polling finds – and they support more strikes in the new year, Adam Forrest reports Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 02:48 1672796880 As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be a good year for the unions After decades when it was – sadly – usually safe to ignore the pronouncements of union leaders, the most widespread outbreak of industrial action since 1979 has meant that they are household names once again. Not yet as familiar as, say, Mick Lynch, is the brand new general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, who formally takes over from Frances (now Baroness) O’Grady on 1 January. He is, though, making a somewhat loud entrance. He told The Independent that the strikes could carry on throughout 2023 if the government refuses to negotiate over pay rises. If we take ministers at their word, that they won’t do so until at least the new public pay body recommendations arrive in April, then the country is in for a prolonged period of conflict. Writes Sean O’Grady: As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be good for the unions The economic reality is on the side of the unions, and Rishi Sunak lacks Thatcher’s sharp political instinct, writes Sean O'Grady Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 01:48 1672793280 I’m a nurse – this is why I voted to strike Ever since I was a young child, I dreamt of being a nurse that worked for the NHS. Twelve years ago, after lots of hard work and determination, I achieved that goal. There were lots of sacrifices from my family, who supported me throughout my course. I currently work as a deputy sister in an NHS hospital in Lincolnshire. My role is as part of an acute cardiology team that has face to face contact with patients that attend the hospital after having heart attacks and following cardiac arrests.

Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 23:34 1672786137 Who is striking this winter and why? Workers in several of Britain’s key service sectors are striking in what is being called the new “winter of discontent” as cost of living pressures clash with below-inflation pay offers. Many strikes, such as that of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), have been going on for months, with warnings union members will vote to take their fight far into 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the highest monthly total since November 2011 saw mass public sector walkouts over pension reforms. Liam James reports: Who is striking this winter and why?

The wild salmon is one of Scotland’s most iconic species, earning its place alongside the red deer, the golden eagle, and the Scottish wildcat. But, like so many other animals, its numbers have been in decline for decades. The population of wild salmon is diminishing on the west coast of Scotland, and even faster on the east coast. Reasons for the fall are many and varied, but a key cause is habitat loss and rising river temperatures, due to climate change. The Scottish Government has also identified other pressures facing wild salmon, including predation by fish, birds and seals, as well as the non-native plans that erode riverbanks. Man-made barriers to migration, such as weirs and bridge foundations, lead to further challenges for the fish, impeding their migration to spawning grounds and increasing the likelihood of them being eaten. The sad truth is that a wild Atlantic salmon now has a miniscule survival rate of only around 1-2%. That contrasts sharply with farm-raised salmon, where the survival rate is around 85% over their two years in the cold seas off Scotland’s west coast. Daily animal husbandry from our salmon farmers, supported by the best vets in the land, has developed world-leading expertise in hatching and rearing salmon that thrive at sea. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part There are a handful of vocal activists, often from urban centres far from rural Scotland, determined to shut down salmon farms – which would make 12,000 people unemployed amid a cost of living crisis – who mistakenly believe that this would somehow help wild salmon. They have no explanation, of course, for the fact that wild salmon numbers are declining at the same rate on the east coast, where there has never been any salmon farming. What is needed is collaboration, not confrontation. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part in finding solutions, engaging constructively with the wild fish sector, and taking meaningful action to save wild salmon. They are determined, for example, to share their knowledge and experience to support wild fisheries with restocking. Fortunately, most people in the fisheries and angling sectors in the Highlands and Islands recognise the importance of a healthy, shared environment, ensuring fish can thrive in our waters. People like Jon Gibb, a fisheries manager based in Fort William, get that. He has long championed a constructive relationship between the farm-raised salmon sector and fisheries and angling groups, arguing that “both the farmed and wild salmon sectors have a common interest to thrive in our shared space”. I agree, which is why I’m delighted that Jon has agreed to coordinate our revamped £1.5 million “wild fisheries fund”, which is paid for directly by Scotland’s salmon farming companies. Funding to protect our salmon heritage The Scottish salmon sector has already funded projects to save and restore a historic dam in the Western Isles that assists wild salmon to progress to their spawning grounds, as well as restoration projects across Scotland that will reduce riverbank erosion and provide tree canopy and in-stream cover for young salmon. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks In the coming year, £145,000 will be available to a broad range of organisations and projects. Applications are invited from fisheries organisations, including local angling clubs, fishery boards and other community associations. The revamped fund will prioritise applications of a practical nature, which aim to protect and enhance wild salmon populations and local angling opportunities, recognising that salmon and trout fishing is at the cultural heart of many Highland communities, and provides human health benefits. Projects could include removing migration barriers, evidence-based and authorised restocking programmes, hatchery-based operations using contemporary techniques, such as genetic screening, and freshwater habitat improvement, like spawning gravel creation. Money is also available for improvements to angling facilities, including riverside paths, boats and buildings, as well as initiatives to support young and disabled anglers. Scottish salmon is part of our national story. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks. We recognise that today’s Scottish salmon farming sector enjoys its strong reputation and success partly due to this heritage. It is in all of our interests to ensure that we protect our freshwater and seawater environment so that one of Scotland’s most iconic species can recover and thrive.

Hardies Property & Construction Consultants is currently renovating its offices in the city. Once the offices on Albert Square are ready, bosses plan to have staff from Hardies and its sister company Shepherds working under the same roof. They will be joined by workers from the recently-acquired John Duguid Partnership. Hardies investment in Dundee offices Gareth Cordiner, the firm’s north division managing partner, believes this will make a real difference. He said: “It’s hugely important especially after Covid. We do have a flexible working policy but we’ve found people want to be back in the office and back together. “The amount of information you share from hearing it across the room, it makes a big difference. “From a mental health point of view it’s brilliant. You see relationships building again, so there’s huge benefits.” Douglas Smith, who was appointed Dundee partner recently, added: “We’ll have our one-stop-shop under one roof and that’s really exciting. “It needs to be a more modern way, with collective thinking.” Mr Smith also outlined his ambition for Hardies to become the go-to business for anyone’s surveying requirements in Dundee. “It’s a pretty exciting time for Hardies in Dundee,” he said. “We’ve got a fairly big team that are looking to make giant strides in the Tayside area moving forward. “We’re trying to build the Hardies brand. “In Dundee, we’re trying to make it a one-stop shop surveying service across all disciplines – building surveying, quantity surveying, you name it, we’re doing it. “We’re going to target sectors we want to work in.” Tayside offices crucial for Hardies Mr Cordiner said its presence in Tayside and Fife – the firm also has offices in Dunfermline, St Andrews and Perth – are key to the business. He added: “Dundee and Perth work closely together as the Tayside region. “Historically in Dundee quantity surveying-wise, we’re historically very strong and very well known. “Joining up with the John Duguid Partnership we’re keen that we become the strongest quantity surveying team in Tayside. “I don’t think we’re far off that at the moment.” Mr Smith said the firm’s progress would be based on “considered and selective movement”.",Dundee property firm looking to make &#8216;giant strides&#8217; in Tayside,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/business-environment/business/4001080/hardies-dundee/

On Wednesday, around half of Britain’s railway lines are closed and only a fifth of services are running as tens of thousands of workers at Network Rail and train operators walk out on the second day of a 48-hour strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT). Train drivers in the Aslef union will strike on Thursday before a second two-day RMT strike begins on Friday. TUC leader Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing”. He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. “We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love. And so our public services can start to improve for everyone who relies on them.” RMT general secretary Mick Lynch warned on Tuesday that industrial action will need to continue beyond May unless a reasonable offer to resolve the row over pay, jobs and conditions is made to the union.

As well as five million for the wind turbines work, planned solar and nuclear power plants which would power future Britain are expected to require about 3.5 million tonnes of steel over the coming years.

Henrik Adam, Chairman of Tata Steel UK which has a pipe mill at Hartlepool, said: “Recent events have shown us just how crucial it is to have a secure energy supply. Achieving this will need an energy revolution in this country requiring millions of tonnes of steel to build new energy generation projects. ""A strong domestic and secure steel industry is also fundamental to delivering the UK Government’s ambitious energy plans. “But if British manufacturers are to supply the essential steel and continue to employ many thousands of people in this country, we need to invest and transform this strategically-important industry so it can make carbon-neutral steel. “Similarly, our steel industry is at a crossroads – if we do nothing, we risk it declining and drifting away to other countries. Down the other path is a new era in which we transform the steel production process to make it fit for the 21st Century.” Henrik added: “Geo-political events and disruptive trade issues in recent years have reminded us of the importance of being self-sufficient in essential products like steel, a product critical for the UK’s infrastructure projects, manufacturing industry and national security.” Roy Rickhuss CBE, General Secretary of Community and NTUSCC Chair, said: “The green energy revolution presents a huge opportunity to build a robust British supply chain based on the supply of top-quality domestic steel."" Gareth Stace, Director General of UK Steel, said: “These numbers clearly demonstrate the huge opportunity the energy transition represents not just to reduce emissions but to boost the UK economy, UK manufacturing and the UK steel sector.

Opportunities have been missed in the past to establish a full UK supply chain for this sector, but with so much growth still in front of us, this is the time to get this right. Similar opportunities exist in our expansion of nuclear, solar and the roll-out of CCS and hydrogen networks. “The UK steel industry is in a prime position to supply the steel for this new UK energy infrastructure and doing so will help maximise the jobs and economic growth the energy transition can deliver for the UK. “Producing UK energy from UK steel is the green industrial revolution in practice, creating green jobs, economic growth and levelling up.”",Million of tonnes of steel needed as new energy revolution races ahead,https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/23225783.million-tonnes-steel-needed-new-energy-revolution-races-ahead/?ref=rss

British wrestler Zack Sabre Jr, who has been vocally anti-Tory in the past, stepped out for a high stakes match at New Japan Pro Wrestling’s (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom 17 event in front of a packed Tokyo Dome crowd. With a global audience tuning in to see former WWE superstar Sasha Banks make her heavily rumoured debut, the 35-year-old grappler took his opportunity to shine a light on the action being taken by the Royal College of Nursing (RNC). Back in November, for the first first time in its 106 year history the RNC voted in favour of strikes, as walkouts affected hospitals across the country with more set to take place on January 18 and 19. Zack has joined those criticising the government over the dispute, and he sent a very blunt message for the Prime Minister as he made his entrance on Wednesday (January 4). Looking straight down the camera, he said: ‘Hey Rishi Sunak! Pay nurses, d**khead! Pay nurses a living wage!’ Zack has a message for the prime minister pic.twitter.com/ECbWf0EX1O— Elijah (@eli1ah) January 4, 2023 Zack Sabre Jr has fans around the world (Picture: Etsuo Hara/Getty Images) Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said last month that the union had ‘no choice’ but to arrange the upcoming strikes. She said: ‘The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January. ‘The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.’ The union is campaigning for a five percent pay rise above inflation to help nurses overcome those real-terms pay cuts, to support nursing staff through the cost of living crisis and recognise their critical skills. There are also record nursing vacancies, with 25,000 nursing staff having quit in the past year, but Mr Sunak previously said while the government was open to talks, a demand for a 19% pay rise wasn’t affordable. He told BBC News NI in December: ‘The health secretary has always been clear that his door is always open for talks – we want to be reasonable, we want to be constructive. ‘We’ve got enormous gratitude for all public sector workers for the job they do, and I know things are difficult right now.’ Got a story?

Al-Quds reported that they had been deported for a range of reasons, including drug abuse, theft, expiration of residency and acting against the public interest. Egyptians are the largest expat group in Kuwait, constituting 24 per cent of the workforce, though that number looks set to reduce as the government works on controlling the labour market and reducing the number of expats across all sectors, particularly within the government. In 2018 Kuwait's Civil Service Commission issued a decree to replace expats in government jobs with Kuwaitis over the next five years. Since then, authorities have rolled out a series of measures aimed at reducing foreign workers in the country. In 2020 Kuwait's parliament said it wanted to reduce the number of Egyptians in the country to ten per cent and introduced a draft law to that effect. In December this year the Kuwaiti government imposed new conditions on Egyptian workers wishing to travel to the Gulf State including a $100 entry fee, an increased work permit documentation fee and a medical examination. READ: Kuwait: death sentence for man who killed woman who refused his advances At the time, Deputy Prime Minister Talal Al-Khaled suspended a 2018 memorandum of understanding which was originally signed to facilitate recruitment between the two countries but did not officially inform Egypt it was being terminated. Four months earlier Kuwait announced that it would lay off 250,000 Egyptian workers and suspend all contracts with non-nationals as 500,000 other Egyptians were already set to lose their jobs. Egyptians have suffered racism in the Gulf country with a video of a Kuwaiti customer slapping an Egyptian cashier two years ago going viral. One influencer called Egyptians ""filthy servants."" Even though they are the largest expatriate group in Kuwait, Egyptians lack employment rights and safety provision. In November last year an Egyptian construction worker was killed in Kuwait allegedly after his colleagues dumped rubbish on him from the third floor after not realising he was below them. A 2015 report on migrant rights found that industry corruption, including overextending project timelines and using cheap materials, put construction workers at risk.

Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan told the PA news agency it was “inevitable” that further strikes will be held unless there is a breakthrough to the long running row. He warned that strikes could escalate, saying train drivers wanted to go “harder and faster” after years of not receiving a pay rise.

Another RMT 48 hour strike will start on Friday, ending a week of travel chaos on the railways, On Wednesday, around half of Britain’s railway lines were closed and only a fifth of services ran as tens of thousands of RMT members at Network Rail and 14 train operators walked out. Mr Whelan told PA he felt rail employers and the Government were “playing games” rather than making any serious attempt to resolve the pay dispute. “The situation is getting worse and my members now want to go harder and faster because of the lack of progress. “We are in a weird world where the Government will do anything to keep private companies in the industry. “It is inevitable that more strikes will be held and probably escalate. “The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government.

He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers.

Next, we need to stop seeing education is something that ends at age 18 or that sees university as the only option with more technical education, lifelong learning and apprenticeship,” he said. We're holding the first BUSINESSiQ Awards - to nominate someone, CLICK HERE He told an audience in Stratford: “One of the biggest changes in mindset we need in education today is to reimagine our approach to numeracy. Right now, just half of all 16 to 19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills, is letting our children down.” Rishi Sunak (Image: PA) Grant Glendinning, Chief Executive and Group Principal at Education Training Collective (Etc.), replied: “I fully agree with the Prime Minister, opportunity is intrinsically linked with education – ensuring that learners have access to the best possible learning experiences. However, while maths, and English, are important and critical foundations of any education pathway towards employment, they do not work in isolation. ""Skills as a whole, starting with English and maths, developed from primary into secondary education, supported by additional learning and development in further education or in the workplace as part of an apprenticeship or T Level, are what will see our young people best positioned to take advantage of the careers and opportunities they pursue, supporting the economic growth of our country. Grant Glendinning (Image: Press release) It will be interesting to understand how this will be rolled out, but with the best interests of our learners and our communities firmly at the heart of Etc. colleges, it is difficult to see how enhanced skills development can be anything but a positive.” Zoe Lewis, Principal and Chief Executive of Middlesbrough College, told us: ""The UK is one of the few developed nations that reduces the time spent in education from around 25 hours per week from the age of 5 to 16 years old to around 16 hours per week between the ages of 16 and 18. Zoe Lewis (Image: Press release) ""We would welcome any opportunity to increase the hours available to continue the development of key skills required for life and the workplace in our young people, whether this be mathematics, English, digital, physical education or employability skills. ""Whilst we would not necessarily single out mathematics from the list of priority skills, we would very much support any increase in investment between in the ages of 16 and 18, alongside a clear plan as to how we can develop and train the increased numbers of teachers that would be required, in light of the current shortages across the sector."" Henri Murison, Chief Executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership said businesses needed young people who were ready for work: ""The Prime Minister is right to be concerned about the progress made by disadvantaged children in this country,"" he said. ""It is simply not good enough that 60% of children do not receive a high enough grade at GCSE in maths to make it on to a T-Level course or other vocation routes to further study. Henri Murison (Image: Press release) ""However it's worth noting that already many young people are studying maths post 16 through resits, in order to get the grade they need to make it through to the system to achieve a higher level of skills.

After the disappointments of the previous decade, this was to be the time when the global economy powered up and got going again. There would be a flowering of new technologies and a colossal boom. It would be the roaring 20s all over again. It hasn’t worked out like that. Instead, the world faces the grim prospect of a second recession in three years. The three biggest economies – the United States, China and the European Union, which between them account for roughly half of all global output – are slowing at the same time. That’s unusual and troubling. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, says a third of the world economy will be in recession in 2023, and even for countries that manage to keep growing it will feel like a recession. The IMF has got it wrong – sometimes seriously wrong – in the past but even so, Georgieva’s pessimism is warranted. Just about every indicator of looming recession is flashing red. Prices are rising faster than wages, reducing consumer spending power. Corporate profitability is being squeezed by rising costs and weakening demand. Developing countries that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are now finding their debt burdens unmanageable. The two big asset bubbles of the post-pandemic era – crypto-currencies and tech stocks – both collapsed in 2022. Central banks are raising interest rates, exposing the vulnerability of “zombie” companies that have survived only thanks to a prolonged period of low interest rates. It is a lot cheaper in the US to borrow money for 10 years than it is to borrow money for one year. In the past this unusual phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale sign of a recession in the offing. China hauled the global economy out of its last serious downturn but is in no shape to do so this time. House prices have been rising at double-digit rates for the past three decades but are now falling in many cities because the boom has led to more and more homes being built. Politically, President Xi Jinping cannot afford a house price crash so he can bring demand and supply back into balance only by curbing property construction. That, coupled with the increase in coronavirus cases since the end of the zero tolerance approach to Covid-19, means China is the country to watch in 2023. The IMF says that for the first time since the early 1990s, China will grow less quickly than the global economy as a whole. It could be worse than the IMF envisages. So, the big question is not whether the global economy is in for a rough year in the 12 months ahead, because that is clearly the case. There may be one or two countries that buck the trend, but the UK is not going to be one of them. Another year of underperformance will keep the debate about Brexit alive, even though adjustment to life outside the EU is not the only – let alone the principal reason – for the UK’s current predicament. This is a global rather than a UK-specific problem, and it predates Brexit. Nor is the question why the bounce-back from the Covid-19 pandemic has been cut short, because that too is obvious. The post-lockdown recovery was built on the shakiest of foundations. Shortages led to a burst of inflation, amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks in the west found themselves powerless to combat a cost of living crisis other than by jacking up interest rates. The recessions or near recessions that will be seen in the US, the EU and the UK this year are no accident. They are a deliberate act of policy, which central bankers justify by saying it is a choice between pain now or more pain later. No, the real issue is whether the roaring 20s have been delayed or will never arrive. Put another way: is the global economy facing a temporary, if nasty, period of stagflation (a combination of weak growth and high inflation) or something deeper: a crisis of capitalism? And if it is the latter, what can be done about it? History may well repeat itself. The 1920s began with a pandemic, an inflationary boom and a deep recession. It took a while for better times to arrive, and when they did the driving force was a wave of new inventions, first developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but which took time to reveal their full potential. Techno-optimists say artificial intelligence and biotechnology will be to the 2020s what radio and the motorcar were to the 1920s: the catalyst for a period of markedly faster growth. They believe a period of abnormally lower interest rates has held back a fourth industrial revolution by allowing no-hoper companies to stagger on. A period of creative destruction will see this misallocation of capital end, leading to higher investment in the industries of the future. But the global economy has now been in the doldrums for 15 years. Money has been cheap and plentiful ever since the banks nearly went bust during the global financial crisis. There is not much evidence to suggest that the fourth industrial revolution is being held back by a shortage of capital. Rather, there has been a reluctance by both governments and the private sector to invest. Governments could have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs to rebuild clapped-out infrastructure, but failed to do so. The private sector preferred to use profits to buy back shares rather than taking a punt on new products. Financial engineering proved lucrative for elites, who assumed – quite wrongly – that because the system was working for them it was working for everybody. In one respect, the roaring 20s have already returned. While living standards are being squeezed for the many, for the super-rich it is a new gilded age. Three factors were behind the massive jump in productivity in the middle decades of the 20th century: ideas, investment and the struggle against inequality. Economies only really started to motor when new products were available to the masses through policies that encouraged full employment, collective bargaining and rising wages. Currently, there are plenty of ideas but the other two factors are missing. Until that changes, the global economy will be stuck in its low-growth rut.

It is estimated just 10% of services will be running on one of the worst days of action for decades. Around 12,500 train drivers from 15 firms will take part in the mass walkout. It comes as over the last week we have seen strike action from 40,000 workers on Network Rail and 14 train operating companies who have continued to strike. RMT members were on strike for 48 hours causing travel chaos for people across the UK. But today it is the turn of Aslef – which represents 96% of the train drivers in England, Scotland and Wales – who will continue into their second day of strikes in two days. Rail workers on the picket line at Grand Central Station in Birmingham yesterday (Picture: PA) MORE : What strikes are planned around New Year 2023? Trains, London buses, road workers and more The strike will bring services on affected lines to a halt and comes as more and more people in many different sectors of the economy are withdrawing their labour as employers refuse to help their employees during the cost-of-living crisis. But it’s not the end, as those from The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers are also set to walk out tomorrow and on Friday. It includes train drivers at 15 rail operators and is likely to shut down much of the country’s rail network. On all five days of action, trains will start later and finish much earlier than usual, running between 7.30am and 6.30pm, National Rail has warned. Tickets for 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 January can instead be used the day before the date on the ticket, or up to and including Tuesday 10 January. Timeline of strikes over the next few weeks – January 5 Train workers at 15 operators with the Aslef union to stage a 24-hour walkout.

Train drivers are joined today by London bus workers at Abellio, who are striking for eight days in total this month. Abellio buses have been affected on strike days – with other buses running but busier than usual. The action started back on December 8, but the bus strike dates around New Year included today and yesterday. Dozens of buses in London are going to be impacted by strikes. Rural Payments Agency (RPA) staff will also resume their strikes. Driving tests have likewise been disrupted today – with DVSA driving examiners’ strike starting in London, the South East, South Wales and the South West. ‘We don’t want to go on strike but the companies have pushed us into this place,’ said Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He added: ‘They have not offered our members at these companies a penny – and these are people who have not had an increase since April 2019. ‘That means they expect train drivers at these companies to take a real-terms pay cut – to work just as hard for considerably less – when inflation is running at north of 14%.’ Mick said: ‘The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us. ‘We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing. And that is unacceptable.’ Yesterday TUC (Trades Union Congress) leader Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of ‘underfunding and understaffing’. He wrote: ‘We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. ‘Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. ‘This is simply unsustainable. ‘But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. ‘That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.’ The mass strike action could cause chaos for commuters (Picture: Getty) Driving examiners and supporters picket outside a Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency office in a strike yesterday (Picture: Getty) MORE : Why aren’t the police allowed to go on strike and is any other profession banned? MORE : Brits heading back to work face worst rail strikes yet with five days of action Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: ‘That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. ‘Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. ‘But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. ‘In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. ‘This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. ‘We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love. ‘And so our public services can start to improve for everyone who relies on them.’ RMT general secretary Mick Lynch warned on Tuesday that industrial action will need to continue beyond May unless a reasonable offer to resolve the row over pay, jobs and conditions is made to the union.

The latest statistics on Scotland’s energy production (not oil and gas reserves) showed that over the first nine months of 2022, generation was up 34.7% compared to the same period in 2021 Final figures for 2021 show that the equivalent of 85.2% of all electricity used in Scotland (total generation minus net exports) came from renewable sources. Due to slightly better weather in 2021 this was actually a slight decrease, but has bounced back up again with the 2022 figures. The energy that is generated in Scotland is exported into the UK National Grid. Consumers in Scotland then buy it back. The further north you go in Scotland the tariff paid for buying it back, increases. So although places like Orkney and the massive windfarms in the north of mainland Scotland are producing well over their own needs in renewables, they are also paying the highest prices to buy back their own locally produced power. Scotland produces most of its renewable energy through wind but hydro is also very important. The future with wave and tidal power makes Scotland’s future as a producer of clean energy very bright. Oil and Gas in the UK Scotland still produces large amounts of fossil fuels through its existing extensive oil and gas fields. The income generated from these sources goes into the UK Exchequer. The UK Government is also very keen to open up more oil and gas fields. Figures from the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) The oil and gas industry plays a central role in the economy of the United Kingdom. Oil and gas account for more than three-quarters of the UK’s total primary energy needs. Oil provides 97 per cent of the fuel for transport, and gas is a key fuel for heating and electricity generation. Transport, heating and electricity each account for about one-third of the UK’s primary energy needs. Oil and gas are also major feedstocks for the petrochemicals industries producing pharmaceuticals, plastics, cosmetics and domestic appliances. Wikipedia Click on this link for more information on UK Oil and Gas: North Sea Transition Authority Scotland’s Renewable Production Energy is mostly a reserved power to the UK Government. The Scottish Government has planning power over the development of wind farms as we have seen recently in Orkney (OIC Faray Windfarm Approved by Scottish Government Despite Reporter’s Recommendation to Refuse ) and licences to develop offshore wind. (Islanders Attend Consultation Events for the West of Orkney Windfarm) There is a major expansion of the wind generation sector in Scotland. In the last twelve months, renewable electricity capacity has risen, up 11.7% from September 2021 to 13.6 GW in September 2022. As of September 2022, 397 renewable electricity projects with a capacity of 17.1 GW are being progressed. 3.4 GW of these are under construction, most of which are offshore wind farms off the Moray Firth. 6.8 GW are awaiting construction and 6.9 GW in planning. The generation and use of energy is a complex picture in Scotland. As part of the UK and with a devolved system of government, control over energy is mostly reserved to the London Government. Oil and Gas is a major sector. The UK Government intends to expand both this and Nuclear production. As well as producing energy we also need to use less but as the weather in 2022 was better for renewable generation it also made our homes and businesses harder to heat. Fuel poverty should not exist in a country which generates so much energy – but it does because we do not control the price or have the means to do so. Scottish Government funded schemes to make our homes and businesses more energy efficient are extremely important (more about that here, Home Energy Scotland). But Scotland still relies very much on fossil fuels.

There is a cost to our landscape and seascape. But, in a climate emergency why is the UK Government developing non-renewable energy sources? And where is the hope for Scots struggling to pay their energy bills when they pay the highest rates in the UK to buy back that same power they see being generated where they live?

It believes the retail sector will be worst affected by recession, shrinking by 4.5% in 2023, more than twice a predicted contraction rate of 2.2% for this year. Conor Lambe, Danske Bank chief economist, said: “The UK economy contracted in the third quarter of 2022 and we think that economic activity in Northern Ireland is also likely to have declined. Output is then projected to fall further in the final quarter of the year and through most of next year, with both economies experiencing a period of recession as a number of factors adversely impact activity levels. “Inflation is expected to decline gradually during 2023 but remain elevated and weigh down on household purchasing power. Consumer confidence is also particularly low and monetary policy is tightening. “Looking forward, and while noting the considerable uncertainty around the outlook, we expect annual output in Northern Ireland to decline by around 1% next year.” But the bank has forecast that the economy will have grown by around 4% by the end of this year, reflecting a relative improvement on the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses and consumers have been hit by rising costs throughout 2022, with inflation prompting the Bank of England to increase interest rates to 3%. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK economy shrank by 0.3% over the three months to October, although there was a rebound in October itself. As well as retail, other consumer-facing sectors such as accommodation and food, along with arts, entertainment and recreation, are also predicted to take heavy hits during 2023. Danske Bank forecast declines of nearly 4% for both sectors. And output for manufacturing companies is also expected to shrink next year, with a 1.1% fall in output, while the construction sector is tipped for a similar rate of contraction. However, slight growth is predicted for the world of information and communication, as well as scientific and technical services. And education and administrative and support services are also predicted to avoid decline.",Northern Ireland facing continued recession in 2023,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/ulsterbusiness/news/northern-ireland-facing-continued-recession-in-2023-42264137.html

Children in years 1, 2 and 3, between the ages of five and eight, will be given age-appropriate lessons designed to introduce them to different careers, training and skills, and inspire them about the world of work. The £2.6m initiative will be introduced across 55 education investment areas, or “cold spots”, where school outcomes are the weakest, targeting 600,000 pupils in more than 2,200 primary schools. Pupils will get the chance to meet employers and “role models” from a range of industries, to try to raise aspirations and link learning to future jobs and careers they may pursue. They will be introduced to careers in the green economy, technology, engineering, construction, Stem, creative industries, aerospace, hospitality and healthcare. The Department for Education (DfE) said evidence had shown that children started to form ideas about their future when they began primary school, yet most careers guidance took place in secondary schools. In addition to the primary careers programme, the DfE also gave details of a new requirement for secondary school pupils to be given greater exposure to providers of technical education, so they know about alternatives to a traditional academic route. Under legislation that came into force at the start of the year, schools will be required to give all pupils in years 8 to 13 at least six opportunities to meet a range of providers of technical education, including apprenticeships, T-levels and higher technical qualifications. Robert Halfon, the minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said good careers advice was vital to open up opportunities for young people from all backgrounds and create the future workforce the UK needed. “The changes we are making to boost our careers programme will raise ambitions from an early age for thousands of children in primary schools across the country, while providing opportunities to unlock talent, think about skills, engage with employers and discover different workplaces.” Oli de Botton, a former headteacher who is chief executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company, which will coordinate the primary careers programme, said: “Our new primary programme will bring careers inspiration to children early in their school life by connecting them with role models and showing them how different subjects relate to jobs.” The education charity Teach First will help train primary school teachers in disadvantaged areas where the scheme will be introduced. Dominic Wyse, a professor of early childhood and primary education at University College London’s Institute of Education, said the initiative’s success would depend on how well it was delivered. “It does worry me it could be terribly dull. There’s a real question – will it motivate children, will it motivate teachers, and is it the sort of push that’s needed right now?” Sarah Hannafin, a senior policy adviser for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), whose members mainly work in the primary sector, said it was right that careers education should not be left to secondary schools. However, she added: “All schools must be provided with the resources they need to provide high-quality careers education, but current provision remains underfunded. Schools will find it challenging to meet increasing requirements and expectations with no additional resources to deliver them.”",Children as young as five in England target of new careers programme,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/05/children-young-five-england-urged-think-about-careers

RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: “Curtailing workers’ freedom to participate in lawful industrial action is always undemocratic and we will look closely at what the Government releases. “We will meet with ministers to see their evidence for the pay process. However, only negotiations on our dispute can avert the planned action this month and I urge the Prime Minister to show a renewed sense of urgency, grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses without further delay. “As for minimum staffing, last month’s action was safe for patients because of detailed discussions we chose to initiate with the NHS to protect emergency services and life-saving care. The public respected that and even ministers acknowledged our constructive approach. “Safe staffing levels that are set in law are what we want to see year-round not just in these extreme circumstances. “We’ve long campaigned for governments to be accountable for safe and effective staffing levels in NHS and social care to prevent one nurse being left with 15, 20 or even 25 sick patients. “The evidence is unequivocal – safe staffing saves lives and having the right number of registered nurses on duty has a direct impact on the safety and quality of patient care. Today’s highly unsafe situation is what is driving our members to say ‘enough is enough’.” Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect said: “This hollow invitation ignores the fact that a majority of public sector workers are not covered by a pay review body, including nearly all civil servants. We have been calling for years for this to be rectified, something which the Government has consistently ignored. “These workers have been some of the most harshly treated over the past decade of real-terms pay cuts, and now the Government is signalling its intent to leave them out once again. “Our members have already indicated their willingness to take industrial action and there is nothing in this announcement that will persuade us not to proceed to a formal ballot as planned.” Unison’s assistant general secretary Jon Richards said: “Ministers should focus their time and energy on rebuilding trust and relationships with workers, not silencing and suppressing them. “Minimum staffing levels in the NHS would be welcome by the public and health staff every single day of the week. That could avoid people being left lying in agony on A&E floors or dying in the backs of ambulances. “The NHS is on its knees because of record vacancies. The idea of limiting legal staffing levels to strike days and threatening to sack or fine health workers at such a time shows proper patient care isn’t ministers’ priority. “The Government is picking ill-advised fights with NHS employees and unions to mask years of dismal failure to tackle pay and staffing.” TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “This is an attack on the right to strike. It’s an attack on working people, and it’s an attack on one of our longstanding British liberties. “It means that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don’t. That’s wrong, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal. “The announcement offers nothing more to help with this year’s pay and the cost-of-living crisis. “The only offer of talks is for next year. But we need to resolve the current disputes and boost the pay of public sector workers now. “The Prime Minister said yesterday his door is always open – if he’s serious, he should prove it. He should take up my offer to get around the table to improve this year’s pay and end the current disputes. “There is a world of difference between promises of jam tomorrow with technical discussions about pay review bodies, and proper negotiations on pay in the here and now. “Our public services are already deep in a staffing crisis. But this Government has gone from clapping key workers to threating them with the sack if they take lawful action for a pay rise. It will only push more people away from essential jobs in public services, harming the whole nation.” Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said: “Just when you thought the Government could go no lower, ministers say they’re looking to deal with strikes by making them illegal, rather than negotiate with unions. “PCS members are on strike because they cannot afford the cost of living. We view any attempt to outlaw strikes as an attack on the trade union movement and we will resist that at every stage.” Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said: “This is an empty offer from the Tory government, and a meaningless stunt from Grant Shapps. “Firefighters and other key workers are facing a ‘real-terms’ pay cut, against a backdrop of rising food and fuel prices during the cost-of-living crisis. “Nothing in this statement from Grant Shapps seeks to address the ‘in work’ poverty faced by these workers who kept our public services going during the pandemic. “They were the Covid heroes. “This grandstanding from Grant Shapps is badly misjudging the public mood. “The Government should call off all pay cuts and we’ll call off strikes. “Grant Shapps should stop telling workers to accept falling real wages.” Claire Sullivan, director of employer relations and union services at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Imposing new anti-strike legislation in a country which already has some of the most onerous strike laws in Europe is unnecessary, weak and unworkable. “The Government is well aware that the proposed ‘voluntary agreements’ in the NHS are already in place due to health workers’ commitment to providing ‘critical to life’ cover. “The way for the Government to avoid current and future workplace disputes is through ongoing, meaningful dialogue and by working in partnership with trade unions. The CSP and other health unions have been warning of the developing NHS crisis for a decade and calling for urgent pay talks for several months, only to be met repeatedly by a complete block from Government.”",Government pressing ahead with ‘minimum safety levels’ legislation,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/unions-government-grant-shapps-nhs-prime-minister-b2256705.html

The official government forecasts from HM Treasury show a fall in UK economic output (gross domestic product, GDP) of 0.8 per cent in 2023. The Scottish Fiscal Commission are predicting a 1.2 per cent fall in Scottish economic output. There are no official forecasts for the Highland economy but it is very likely that the GDP performance will be even worse, with probably a fall of about 1.5 per cent. The reasons for that include the greater importance of the tourism industry. Inflation in 2023 is forecast to be about five per cent. That implies an annual fall in personal incomes of about 6.5 per cent in the Highlands. That means another substantial reduction in personal spending, which will have serious negative implications for local shops and other businesses. Looking further ahead, 2024 will almost certainly be better but there can be little doubt that 2023 will be another bad year for the local economy. The world economy had a very bad 2022 because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and an inflation rate exceeding 10 per cent. The huge increase in oil and gas prices has badly affected the output of many industries and also consumer spending. There is little expectation of an improvement until later in 2023, as the above forecasts show. The Highlands have a diversified economy, dominated by the service sector, including tourism in normal years. The manufacturing sector is relatively small but includes important industries such as offshore oil and gas production, renewable energy, Scotch whisky and fish processing. Public sector employment has held up well, because of the importance of bodies such as the Highland Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, NatureScot and the Crofting Commission. However, all their budgets have been under severe pressure and that will continue during 2023. Tourism is very important for many parts of the Highlands. It had a very bad 2022 and unfortunately there are few signs of a significant improvement in 2023. There were big falls in visitor numbers last year because of the various Covid restrictions, which resulted in similar falls in revenue for local hotels, B&Bs and many local shops. Hopefully there will be a revival during 2023. Some industries have done surprisingly well, such as Scotch whisky. New distilleries and expansions are currently under construction in various parts of the Highlands. It is a very strange time for the energy industry in the Highlands, including offshore oil and gas, wind farms and other renewables. Oil and gas production is declining steadily but the recent huge increases in world oil and gas prices have helped existing fields and will possibly lead to a few new developments, despite environmental opposition. In contrast, there has been disappointing progress with renewable energy developments and there are few reasons to expect 2023 to be better. A few local businesses, notably Global Energy at Nigg, are doing very well from wind farm contracts but the overall growth has been much less than predicted. The fishing industry should have a better year because of recent international agreements on fish catches. It and the local fish farms have also benefitted from the rises in consumer prices. Most other local businesses have been badly affected by the huge rises in energy prices. However, world oil and gas prices have fallen significantly in recent weeks. Consumer confidence is low and I expect that to continue during the first half of 2023 at least. The lower consumer spending will have negative impacts for shops and other service sector businesses. More closures seem inevitable. There can be little doubt that the first half of 2023 will be another bad time for the Highland economy. I hope there will be a big improvement during the second half of the year but the current indications are not promising. Tony Mackay is an Inverness-based economist.

Morris Leslie, the company behind the West Kinfauns plans, won planning permission in principle in August. 2022? The proposal is for a four-star, four-storey hotel as well as holiday lodges, transport museum and shops. Cafes, restaurants, bakeries and a cycle repair shops could also form part of the development, which could create up to 130 full-time jobs. Next steps in Perthshire leisure hub Morris Leslie’s group operations director Graham Ogilvie has revealed the next steps for the development. Reflecting on a year of progress, he said: “2022 has all been about getting the consent. 2023 is working through the consent and splitting the development into different parts. “The lodges will be the first part of the development. We will progress with the applying for detailed consent and then construction will commence. “This is something we will do ourselves. In the past 18 months we have created our first holiday park at Alyth. This would also be done under the Morris Leslie Villages banner. “It will be around 50 lodges on site. This part of the project alone would be an investment of around £10 million.” Hotel operator sought Morris Leslie is best known for hiring construction equipment, but also has auction and property interests. It also has its headquarters on the site it acquired from Edrington in 2019. However, the company is not going to be a hotel operator. Armed with the outline planning permission from Perth and Kinross Council it will be marketing the hotel opportunity. “There have been discussions with operators that are ongoing,” Mr Ogilvie said. “Getting the brand is the easier bit, it’s the funding and development of the construction project where there are negotiations and discussions ongoing. “I’d like to think we’ll have an operator on board in 12 months’ time.” He warns that the quoted £33.8 million cost is likely to be far higher due to inflation. “The build costs from when we started the project to where we are now have moved significantly but room rates for hotels have moved higher as well,” he said. The park and ride facility, museum and retail elements of the project are likely to come at the later stages of the development. Neighbouring the site is a new 15-home development by Ogilvie Homes who won permission on appeal to the Scottish Government. Morris Leslie hopes around 80,000 people a year could be attracted to the site, boosting the local economy by £4m.

Comment No one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are The dysfunctional rail system can only be fixed if rail pensions are also sorted out John Ralfe 6 January 2023 • 9:35am 350,000 people are part of the Railways Pension Scheme Credit: Jacob King/PA Wire New Year, new rail strikes, new chaos for rail passengers. Although unions have been locked in a bitter dispute with government and rail companies for months, over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions, we haven’t heard much about pensions. Perhaps this is because no one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are? Pensions for train operating company staff are still based on final salary, and most still have a retirement age of 60. Even public sector pensions are now based on career average salaries, with a higher retirement age. The average salary for a train driver with 10-20 years experience is reported to be £55,000, so a driver retiring at 60 with 30 years pension would get an average inflation-linked pension of £22,000, plus a £33,000 cash lump sum. Train company accounts show the annual cost of new pension promises is around 60pc of salary – a huge part of overall pay – even after employee contributions. Rail pensions have a unique “cost sharing” arrangement, with all regular and deficit cash contributions split 60/40 between employers and employees, which may explain the reluctance to increase annual cash contributions. Each train operating company is part of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), set up at privatisation in 1994. It is an industry-wide scheme with over 100 legally separate sections, including Network Rail, and freight, engineering and maintenance companies. At privatisation, all pensioners and deferred members were transferred to a new section with a “crown guarantee” underwritten by taxpayers. RPS is one of the UK’s largest pension schemes, with £37bn of assets at December 2021, and 350,000 members, including 100,000 current employees. Each RPS section has a three-year valuation but the December 2016 valuation for train operating companies have still not been agreed with the Pensions Regulator, way, way beyond the legal deadline. Although the established rail franchising rules mean train operating companies must pay cash contributions over the life of a franchise, they have no liability for a deficit when the franchise ends. The deficit is simply passed on to the next company taking over the franchise, in a game of pass-the-parcel. If no one is prepared to take on the franchise, it reverts to the Government. The latest accounts for each of the train operating companies show the combined pension deficit is around £8bn. We know the effective re-nationalisation of the train operators in 2020 means all the industry’s annual losses are paid by taxpayers. But re-nationalisation also means taxpayers are on the hook for the pension deficit, which has been hidden from taxpayers. The dysfunctional rail system can only be sorted out if rail pensions are also sorted out. Despite the threat of further strikes, this means closing the expensive and risky defined benefit pension and moving to defined contribution. The good news for rail staff is that some of the cost savings can be used to increase monthly pay. Defined contributions would still leave the £8bn deficit to be paid, partly through higher fares, but with taxpayers left picking up most of the bill.

The British Medical Association (BMA) warned of three days of further disruption for the NHS if health secretary Steve Barclay continues to refuse to negotiate over pay demands. It comes ahead of a ballot opening on 9 January, when 45,000 junior doctors in England will be asked whether they want to strike in the row over pay. The BMA claimed that Mr Barclay was making attempts to find a negotiated settlement impossible by ignoring “all calls and letters” despite the prospect of strike action. “Pay erosion, exhaustion and despair are forcing junior doctors out of the NHS, pushing waiting lists even higher as patients suffer needlessly,” said Dr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Robert Laurenson, co-chairs of the BMA junior doctors committee. They added: “The government’s refusal to address fifteen years of pay erosion has given junior doctors no choice but to ballot for industrial action. If the government won’t fight for our health service, then we will.” The union said successive governments have overseen 15 years of real-term pay cuts for junior doctors, saying it amounted to a “staggering and unjustifiable” 26.1 per cent decline in pay since 2008-09. But the government has awarded only a 2 per cent pay rise for junior doctors, and Mr Barclay has continued to point to the recommendation of the independent pay review body as a reason to avoid negotiations. The BMA said it was “particularly galling” to see Rishi Sunak and his ministers refer to the pay review body. “The reality is that the doctors’ pay review body has been constrained by political interference for more than a decade,” said the union’s co-chairs. The prospect of fresh NHS disruption comes as ambulance staff prepare to walk out on 11 and 23 January, while nurses will strike again for two consecutive days on 18 and 19 January. The government has vowed to press ahead with plans to introduce new legislation to enforce “minimum safety levels” in the NHS and five other key sectors during industrial action. Health unions reacted with fury to the move, saying it would do nothing to resolve the disputes breaking out across the country. The Royal College of Nursing, GMB and Unison – leading the walks-outs planned for nurses and ambulance staff later in January – also vowed to opposed “desperate” anti-strike legislation. The government also urged union leaders to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about public sector pay settlements for 2023-24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged strikes. But unions bosses said ministers must engage on pay demands for the current year, with the GMB health union accusing the government of trying to “kick the can down the road”. The BMA and other health bodies have warned of an “exodus” of NHS staff as industrial dispute rumbles on. Four in ten (40 per cent) of junior doctors plan to leave the health service as soon as they can find another role, a survey carried out by the BMA last month found. Low pay and poor working conditions were the main reasons cited for wanting to leave, with the union warning that the NHS “would not be able to cope” without two-fifths of its junior doctor workforce. It comes after Mr Barclay appeared to blame high numbers of flu, Covid and Strep A cases for the particular pressures the NHS faced over Christmas – a claim refuted by health leaders who pointed to long-term struggles. Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA’s consultants committee, said the government’s refusal to admit that the NHS is in a state crisis was “simply delusional”.",Junior doctors to vote on plans to hold three-day strike in row over pay,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/junior-doctors-strike-nhs-march-b2256855.html

The latest S&P Global/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI), closely watched by the housebuilding sector, scored 48.8 in December, down from 50.4 in November. Any score below 50 indicates that construction sector output has shrunk, and December’s score marks the first contraction since August. It also came in broadly in line with the consensus, with analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics predicting PMI would fall to around 48.5. The sector has suffered the knock-on effects of a slowing housing market, with mortgages becoming more expensive for home buyers resulting in fewer house sales, economists said. Yet construction firms continue to face higher inflation, pushing up the cost of raw materials and transportation, and the looming threat of a recession. As a result, builders are feeling downbeat about the future of their businesses, the survey revealed. December saw confidence among businesses in the outlook for the year drop into negative territory for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and for only the sixth time on record. Dr John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: “The construction sector was stuck in the mud in December with the steepest fall in activity since the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020 and a similarly fast drop in pipelines of new work. “Housebuilding saw a notable change of direction, with a mix of higher inflation for raw materials and transportation and the squeeze on affordability rates for mortgages resulting in fewer house sales.” The commercial sector marked a “bright spot” in the survey, with activity growing fractionally, with a score of 50.3. But it was offset by contractions across the residential and civil engineering sectors in December. Dr Glen added: “Civil engineering, responsible for larger projects, continued to be the weakest performer again, with a sixth month in the doldrums as uncertainty about the UK economy reared its ugly head again and customers hesitated.” Furthermore, the survey suggests that builders are reining back on recruitment amid a hesitancy to spend too much when the future of the economy is uncertain. Employment fell below a score of 50 for the first time since January 2021, with weak sales meaning that vacancies are often not being filled, the survey indicated. Dr Glen said: “Builders are fast running out of the resilient spirit maintained over the last couple of years as the blocks to success piled up and the winter of discontent with high inflation, strikes and shortages continues.” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The construction sector managed to keep its head above water through the autumn, but now is being dragged down by the recession in the wider economy and the surge in borrowing costs faced by households and businesses.” But he pointed out that a drop in activity in December may have been partially driven by some builders “downing tools” during the week of heavy snow across parts of the UK.",Builders deflated as construction sector shrinks,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/builders-deflated-as-construction-sector-shrinks-b2257249.html

Speaking on a visit to a school in Battersea, south-west London, the Prime Minister said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday.” Pressed whether the talks would include discussions on this year’s pay, the Prime Minister did not rule this out, saying: “What we have said is we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation with all union leaders about what is responsible, what is reasonable, and what is affordable for our country when it comes to pay. “I’m hopeful that those talks can be constructive and we can find a way through this.” Asked whether he could meet the nursing union’s demands “halfway” after it suggested a pay rise of ten per cent rather than nearly double, the PM added: “We have always been clear that we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation, a two way conversation with union leaders.” The Standard understands that the move is a new approach by the Government, with Cabinet ministers, not the PM, meeting the unions that their departments work with, and that the Government aims to talk about pay deals for 2023/24 rather than this year. However, the stand-off between the Government and unions has escalated after ministers proposed bringing in legislation to force some sectors such as health and transport to continue delivering a “minimum service” during industrial action. Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation. Asked a second time whether people could be sacked for not going to work under the new law, the premier said: ""I fully believe in the unions' role in our society and the freedom for them to strike. ""I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption. ""That's why we're going to bring forward new laws, in common with countries like France, Italy, Spain and others, that ensure that we have minimum levels of safety in critical areas like fire, like ambulance, so that even when strikes are going on you know that your health will be protected. ""I think that's entirely reasonable and that's what our new laws will do."" Labour has said it would repeal the “minimum service” laws, if they are passed before the General Election, and if it wins the poll expected next year. Britain is being hit by a wave of strikes including by rail workers, nurses, paramedics, postal workers, border staff and civil servants.","Rishi Sunak invites all union leaders for ‘grown-up, honest’ talks on Monday in bid to end strikes",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/strikes-rishi-sunak-unions-talks-rail-nurses-b1051247.html

The Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure vital public services maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike. Minimum safety levels will be set for fire, ambulance and rail services and the Government said it will consult on the “adequate level of coverage”. Speaking from the picket line at Euston station on Friday, Mr Lynch told BBC Breakfast that the Government is trying to “close down” the unions with the new legislation. “What this is a symbol of is that the Government are losing the argument,” he said. “They’ve lost the argument on austerity and pay, and the state of our national public services. “And instead they want to close that argument down by closing down the unions and stopping us from campaigning against poverty.” He said the Bill is a threat to sack union members if they refuse to go to work. “What they are saying is that they will sack our members if they don’t go to work,” he said. “They are going to conscript our members. “We have to name who will go to work, and if those members in a lawful manner don’t want to cross our picket line they can be dismissed individually and the union can be fined. “So we will have to see what the law says.” It comes as services have been crippled by the walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) at Network Rail and 14 train operators on Friday. The action will last for 48 hours and follows a stoppage on Thursday by train drivers in the Aslef union which caused widespread disruption. Only around 20% of normal services are running on Friday and trains will finish earlier. The strike ends a week of industrial action on the railways, with the dispute remaining deadlocked. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a school in south-west London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had invited union leaders for what he hopes will be a “grown-up” conversation on Monday about what is affordable. The Prime Minister was asked if proposed legislation could see nurses sacked for striking, and if it was his ambition to go further and make some more strikes in critical services illegal. Mr Sunak said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday. “We incredibly value the important work that our public sector workers do, especially our nurses, and we want to have an honest, grown-up conversation about what’s affordable, what’s responsible for the country. “Those invitations have gone out and I’m hopeful that those meetings can happen on Monday so we can have a productive conversation and find a way through this.” Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation. Asked whether people could be sacked under the legislation for not working, Mr Sunak told broadcasters: “I fully believe in the unions’ role in our society and the freedom for them to strike. “I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption. “That’s why we’re going to bring forward new laws, in common with countries like France, Italy, Spain and others, that ensure that we have minimum levels of safety in critical areas like fire, like ambulance, so that even when strikes are going on you know that your health will be protected. “I think that’s entirely reasonable and that’s what our new laws will do.” He added that he is “hopeful” that talks with union leaders can be “constructive” and “we can find a way through this”.",Proposed strike legislation shows Government is losing argument – Mick Lynch,https://www.standard.co.uk/business/business-news/proposed-strike-legislation-shows-government-is-losing-argument-mick-lynch-b1051254.html
Luke O'Reilly,85370094,https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/01/06/11/24d28f2a9beb1a6fcb803eb1188503e5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjczMDg5Mzc0-2.70463663.jpg?width=1200,en,2023-01-06 12:42:19,-0.375,GB,"RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has described legislation that will aim to minimise disruption during industrial action as a “symbol” that the Government is “losing the argument”. The Government announced on Thursday that they are pressing ahead with plans to introduce new legislation for “minimum safety levels” during industrial action. The Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure vital public services maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike. Minimum safety levels will be set for fire, ambulance and rail services and the Government said it will consult on the “adequate level of coverage”. Speaking from the picket line at Euston station on Friday, Mr Lynch told BBC Breakfast that the Government is trying to “close down” the unions with the new legislation. “What this is a symbol of is that the Government are losing the argument,” he said. “They’ve lost the argument on austerity and pay, and the state of our national public services. “And instead they want to close that argument down by closing down the unions and stopping us from campaigning against poverty.” He said the Bill is a threat to sack union members if they refuse to go to work. “What they are saying is that they will sack our members if they don’t go to work,” he said. “They are going to conscript our members. “We have to name who will go to work, and if those members in a lawful manner don’t want to cross our picket line they can be dismissed individually and the union can be fined. “So we will have to see what the law says.” It comes as services have been crippled by the walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) at Network Rail and 14 train operators on Friday. The action will last for 48 hours and follows a stoppage on Thursday by train drivers in the Aslef union which caused widespread disruption. Only around 20% of normal services are running on Friday and trains will finish earlier. The strike ends a week of industrial action on the railways, with the dispute remaining deadlocked. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a school in south-west London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had invited union leaders for what he hopes will be a “grown-up” conversation on Monday about what is affordable. The Prime Minister was asked if proposed legislation could see nurses sacked for striking, and if it was his ambition to go further and make some more strikes in critical services illegal. Mr Sunak said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday. “We incredibly value the important work that our public sector workers do, especially our nurses, and we want to have an honest, grown-up conversation about what’s affordable, what’s responsible for the country. “Those invitations have gone out and I’m hopeful that those meetings can happen on Monday so we can have a productive conversation and find a way through this.” Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation.

As many projects were pushed back last year, the beginning of 2023 will be marked by a steady pipeline of work. However, this optimism will be short-lived. Recessionary forces will strike and work is expected to tail off at the back end of 2023. No one feels confident. It is a nervous period to operate as a business, and the sector must stay alert. For the housing market, demand is falling amidst the cost of living crisis, job insecurity and the recession. Declining property prices should stabilise by Spring 2023 yet only those not bound to the difficulties of securing a mortgage or with sufficient savings will be able to afford the luxury of entering the property ladder. The government could help stimulate demand in the housing market by introducing a reduced stamp duty rate for first-time buyers and those wanting to downsize to a smaller property. Confidence in the market will return, but it will take time. Ultimately while the best-run construction companies will survive, partly due to their inherent financial strength, others, including good contractors who may be dependent on third parties, will unfortunately fail. The recession and cost of the living crisis will continue to bite hard. The sector must brace itself for a challenging and uncertain 2023.","UK building sector activity falls, as house prices drop again; eurozone inflation down – business live",https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jan/06/uk-house-prices-fall-us-jobs-eurozone-inflation-train-strikes-business-live

In all, occupiers from a wide range of business sectors have taken a combined total of 120,000 sq ft at Malton’s premier employment park. Sean Harrison, managing director of Harrison Developments said: “These new deals are a tremendous vindication of the substantial investment we have made in our park. “More than 350 new and sustainable jobs have been created on site, which makes us very proud. The wide variety of successful businesses here is also an indication of the strength of the economy in the Ryedale area. Bella di Notte (Image: Press release) “We are especially pleased that successful Yorkshire businesses such as Bella di Notte and Dales The Chef’s Choice have moved into larger premises on our park, because they like the location and the ambience so much. We have been delighted to accommodate their needs, as they have outgrown their current buildings. “These are not the easiest of times, as we emerge from a global pandemic into a worrying cost of living crisis, but the current level of activity at our park gives us confidence for the future,” said Mr Harrison. Luke Counter, owner of the multi-award-winning Counter Interiors, which now occupies a new 1,500 sq ft mezzanine showroom, said: “I can’t speak highly enough of the Malton Enterprise Park, which is the perfect base for us. The flexibility of the mezzanine unit which we occupy means that we now have an extensive showroom, storeroom and offices. “We are based in Clifton in York, but quite a few of our customers are from the Malton and Ryedale area, so it made sense for us to open another showroom here. The location, just by the A64, is ideal, with easy access to the rest of the county. The whole park looks magnificent, which creates the perfect atmosphere for businesses here to flourish.” Meanwhile Bella di Notte, the popular women’s fashion retailer, which originally moved to the Malton Enterprise Park four years ago, has recently taken extra space to accommodate its growth.

Just this week, Amazon said it was axing 18,000 workers, or 6% of its office staff, while business software firm Salesforce said it would reduce its workforce by 10%, or roughly 8,000 people. That followed announcements from dozens of other firms including big names such as Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, hardware heavyweight Cisco, and payments firm Stripe. Despite the belt-tightening seen in Silicon Valley, the world's largest economy soldiers on. Employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, according to the latest official figures. Although that was slower than gains seen in 2021, when activity roared back to life after the pandemic, it was still strong by most standards. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, returning to historic lows. The economy is widely predicted to slow in the coming months as rising prices weigh on consumer spending. Firms are also grappling with higher borrowing costs after the US central bank hiked rates rapidly last year. So are the cuts in the tech industry a warning sign for others? ""I don't think people should be worried,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. ""What we're seeing right now seems to be... a correction, not the start of an ominous, systematic recession."" Many tech executives making the announcements have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic, when more activity moved online and business boomed. Funding for smaller start-ups has also dried up due to higher interest rates and the sharp downturn in the US stock market in 2022. Big hits some firms have taken from the meltdown in the crypto sector have not helped the mood either. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM, said the wave of tech cuts represented a ""necessary and expected"" adjustment after a generation of rapid growth, fuelled in part by low interest rates, which culminated in the pandemic frenzy. ""An era of excess has come to an end,"" he said. ""Firms and individuals should be prepared to reset expectations about growth, employment and investment across what continues to be a very solid industry."" He suggested that tech firms will no longer be insulated from ups and downs in the wider economy, including the expected downturns in Europe and the UK this year. But he added that the job losses should not be ""over-interpreted"", noting that many of the workers affected, at least in the US, appear to be finding new jobs quickly. The latest jobs report from the Labor Department showed that payrolls in the information sector - which includes much of the tech industry - shrank by just 5,000 from November to December. That's despite thousands of job cuts being announced in recent months and compared to a year ago, employment is up. ""It's probably a canary in the coal mine for the global economy more than it is for the American economy,"" he added, noting that many of the tech cuts have hit foreign staff. Last week, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that a third of the world would likely be in recession in 2023. That will hurt tech firms, many of which do big business overseas. But for now, the US labour market has remained unexpectedly resilient, making some hopeful that the country will be able to fend off a harsh downturn, despite the central bank raising interest rates to try to cool the economy and price rises. Nearly every sector in the US economy added jobs last month, with bars and restaurants, health care firms and construction businesses helping to drive the gains. Although job losses are rising - especially in sectors vulnerable to higher interest rates like housing, banking and tech - the figures overall remained near historic lows last year, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has been tracking such announcements since the 1990s. ""We are seeing the labour market cooling,"" he says. ""It's a slowdown but I don't think I could say at this point whether or not it's a panic situation."" Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, said he worries many of the layoff announcements reflect peer pressure, as executives feel compelled to copy other firms making cuts - even as they continue to churn out healthy profits. If that sentiment spreads, as he expects, it risks turning the forecasts of economic hardship into reality. ""Companies do what other companies do,"" he said. ""This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because if everybody lays somebody off, the unemployment rate will go up and we will in fact have a worse economy.""",Are tech job cuts a warning for the wider economy?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64189106?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

This chatty planet is currently rewinding, so a boss or co-worker from the past could be helpful to you today. Head here for everything you need to know about being an Aries Taurus April 21 to May 21 Your questing mind may ramp up its search for new opportunities and fresh experiences, as restless Mercury links with the Sun in your sector of travel and adventure. If you want to traverse new terrain, you will need to leave your comfort zone to explore other avenues apart from the tried and trusted. And yet you might be drawn back to a place you once visited and really loved. Head here for everything you need to know about being a Taurus Gemini May 22 to June 21 With Mercury your ruler continuing to rewind in an intense zone, this could be a good time to ask yourself some searching questions.

Head here for everything you need to know about being a Cancer Leo July 24 to August 23 If you can put work and responsibilities to one side then do so, Leo, as a delightful influence encourages you to socialise and enjoy life.

Head here for everything you need to know about being a Leo Virgo August 24 to September 23 Your sector of creativity and self-expression looks lively, as the Sun’s merger with Mercury sets you thinking. Whether you run a small enterprise, are creative, or have a lot of leisure activities you enjoy, you may spot ways in which you can make better use of your time.

Head here for everything you need to know about being a Virgo Libra September 24 to October 23 Whatever you’re dealing with, a key influence suggests thinking out of the box and trying new ways. As the planet of talk and thought aligns with the Sun, be open to ideas and suggestions you may not have considered. On a lighter note, luscious Venus’s presence in Aquarius can be perfect for light-hearted dates or a chance to get out and about, meet someone new, and relax.

Rebecca Morelle,85546280,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F74F/production/_128211336_virgin-orbit-88.jpg,en,2023-01-07 04:12:22,-0.019,GB,"The first-ever orbital rocket launch from British soil is set to blast off on Monday, marking the start of the UK's race to space. The ambition is to turn the country into a global player in space - from manufacturing satellites, to building rockets and creating new spaceports. But can the UK carve out a place in an increasingly crowded market - and why try to reach for the stars? ""We are the guinea pigs,"" says Melissa Thorpe. ""It is the first time any of us have done this, so it's been quite a learning experience."" Melissa is in charge of Spaceport Cornwall, which is about to attempt its very first foray into space. She's showing me around their base at Newquay Airport. There's all the usual hubbub of activity: passengers arriving, suitcases being loaded, planes being fuelled. But there's also something more surprising on the tarmac: a 21m-long rocket. A team is busy prepping it for the first ever launch from UK soil that will take satellites into orbit around the Earth. But this is a blast off with a difference. There won't be a vertical launch from the ground. Instead, the rocket is fixed underneath the wing of a modified jumbo jet. Once the plane is mid-air, the rocket will be released and fire its engines to head into space. Setting up the UK's first spaceport has taken years and a lot of hard work, plus an entirely new regulatory framework to ensure these launches are safe. The hope is it will make a difference to the local area, one of the poorest in the UK, by bringing in new companies and creating new jobs. ""I think it's the next chapter for Cornwall,"" Melissa says. ""We were at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. We're not new to pioneering technologies."" But there's a wider ambition too. If this succeeds, it should help to position the UK as a leading place for space. However, this isn't the first attempt at creating a British launch industry. A white and red rocket, nicknamed ""the lipstick"", was supposed to be the start of something big for the UK. It blasted off in 1971, sending a satellite into space. The programme was called Black Arrow, and this was the first British-built rocket to deliver a British-built satellite into orbit - although it took off from Australia. But the costs were deemed too high by the government, so that first launch turned out to be the last. The UK's launch industry hit a long pause after this, but another aspect did take off in Britain - satellite building. And this has helped to drive a thriving space sector, which, according to a recent government report, is worth £16.5bn a year to the UK economy and employs nearly 50,000 people. ""We absolutely knock it out of the park when it comes to small satellite manufacture,"" says Dr Alice Bunn, CEO of UKSpace, the trade association of British space companies. Until now, she says, satellites built in the UK have had to be shipped abroad to get into space, but this first launch will change that. And it comes at a time when satellites have become integral to our lives - although Alice says most people are unaware of how dependent we are on this technology. ""Think about satellite navigation systems, environmental monitoring, emergency response - let alone all the telecommunications capability - that we can provide from space. It really is a running thread through our lives,"" she says. And some companies have big plans with this technology. The Cardiff-based company Space Forge thinks a whole host of new materials can be made in orbit. In a cleanroom, one of their small satellites is being painstakingly prepared for its journey. It's one of nine being sent into space by the Cornwall launch. Space Forge describe their shoe box-sized satellites as mini factories. ""In space, with the absence of gravity, you can mix together any different materials you want,"" says Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bacon. ""So if you take the whole periodic table, and start putting things together - like lead, aluminium, rubidium, einsteinium - there are billions of new alloys that you can now make that you couldn't make on Earth."" The new materials could be used in electric vehicles, green technology or computing, he explains. And he thinks there are some big advantages to launching these satellites close to their Welsh base. ''The fact that we can just drive down the road for a couple hours to get to our spaceport is a huge impact,"" Andrew says. But it's not just Cornwall racing to space. Amidst the bleakly beautiful undulating hills and jagged cliffs of the Shetland island of Unst, there's a hive of activity as diggers and dumper trucks come and go. The team here is celebrating because an important milestone has been reached. The concrete is setting on their first launch pad, one of three planned at the site. The SaxaVord Spaceport is being constructed on a peninsula jutting out into the sea, at the northernmost tip of the UK. ""I think the first response from the locals was that maybe it was an April Fool or something like that,"" says Debbie Strang, SaxaVord's chief operating officer. ""And then, as they've seen the progress and the development, there's been real excitement about what we've been doing."" There's a good reason why they've chosen such a remote place, where sheep and Shetland ponies outnumber the inhabitants. ""It's the safety element for us,"" says Debbie. ""What we're doing needs to be as far away as possible from population centres, so that when the rocket leaves, there's no real danger to people nearby."" SaxaVord is aiming for the UK's first vertical rocket launch to take satellites into orbit, with up to 30 launches a year once it's fully up and running. It's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland. Others are planned in Sutherland in the Highlands and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. The hope is that these could all boost local economies, and that's especially important in Unst. ""This island's suffered quite badly from depopulation over the last 20 or 30 years,"" explains Scott Hammond, the deputy CEO of SaxaVord. ""There was a small airfield here that used to be the third busiest heliport in the UK. And then they also had an RAF station here. ""When that left, it halved the population of the island and it clearly had a massive economic impact."" He hopes the spaceport could give the island a boost. ""We'll have more and more service jobs, during the fuelling of the rockets, for example, putting the liquid oxygen into the rockets. And those of course, will be highly paid, highly skilled jobs."" But if you're building a launchpad, you also need rockets - and SaxaVord is working with several companies looking to use Unst to blast off. One of these is Skyrora, based in Cumbernauld, just outside of Glasgow. Inside their vast hanger, the team is busy working on different rocket parts, from nose cones, to engines and containers for propellants. The company is making smaller prototypes, before building a larger rocket, Skyrora XL, that they plan to eventually launch from the Shetland Islands. ""You do a full design on paper and then you start building it. You build prototypes, you do tests, you go back to the drawing board and see what needs to be fixed,"" says Ahsan Zaman. He's just finished his aerospace degree, and says the new push for space in the UK is opening up opportunities for science and engineering graduates. He's proud to be working on the project. ""If we're successful, then we'll forever be known as the first people to do it in the UK. So yeah, it is an honour as well as exciting."" While the launch industry is just starting to come together in the UK, it's much better established in other parts of the world. And one company in particular now dominates the market: Elon Musk's SpaceX. With their reusable rockets, the company has massively cut the price of sending satellites into space. Can the raft of small new rocket companies compete? Skyrora's CEO Volodymyr Levykin says he wants his rockets to offer a more bespoke service. ""We want to be like a satellite taxi service,"" he explains. ""To launch whenever the customer wants us to launch and deliver them to an exact position they need to be in orbit."" He thinks because more and more small satellites are being built, the market to launch them will grow - but not every company will make it. ""Some of us, of course, will fail,"" he says. ""But there are some who are believers in this emerging market. And we decided to invest earlier rather than later, to be ready when the market actually will start to boom."" The UK government says it wants to push the space sector, and is investing in research and development. But UKSpace's Alice Bunn says the support needs to be long term. ""You will not become a global space player by investing in research and development alone. There has to be some kind of government commitment to ongoing operational capability."" She says this could mean the government signing up as a customer for launches, for example. ""We need to think a little bit creatively, industry and government working together, just to get us off the ground here."" All eyes are now on Cornwall, waiting for the first UK launch to blast off. It will be just the start for this new industry and there will be many challenges ahead. But as the well-known mantra goes, space is hard - and anyone working in this sector knows this. The hope is that with this high risk, comes the possibility of sky-high rewards. Follow Rebecca on Twitter.

In a sign of the scale of the problems facing the NHS, Rishi Sunak will spend Saturday focusing on how to ease the pressure on frontline services. But Mr Sunak has been warned that the rare weekend meeting is unlikely to reverse the NHS’ fortunes, which have been blamed on “years of inaction”. Senior doctors say the NHS is on a knife edge, with many A&E units struggling to keep up with demand and trusts and ambulance services declaring critical incidents. Discharge rates fell to a new low in England last week, with only a third of those patients ready to be released from hospital actually leaving. Mr Sunak, during a visit to a school on Friday, said he recognised that the NHS was “under enormous pressure”. No 10’s NHS Recovery Forum will see the Prime Minister hold talks with health experts about how to improve performance. Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Treasury minister John Glen, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden and the chief executive officer of NHS England Amanda Pritchard are also set to attend. The focus will be on four crucial issues: social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care, and primary care. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there were “no silver bullets” to solving the crisis currently being experienced at hospitals and other care centres. “This crisis has been a decade or more in the making and we are now paying the high price for years of inaction and managed decline,” said Mr Taylor. “Patients are experiencing delays that we haven’t seen for years. “High levels of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rising Covid levels are exacerbating the problem but the cause is decades of under-investment in staffing, capital and the lack of a long-term solution to the capacity-crunch facing social care. “None of these problems can be solved tomorrow.” The Prime Minister, in his first speech of 2023 on Wednesday, made reducing NHS waiting lists one of his key pledges before the next election, which is due to take place before 2025. Saturday’s Downing Street forum is expected to last most of the day. As well as ministers, attendees will include chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations, local areas and councils from across the country. Clinical experts from Royal Colleges and independent sector organisations working with health and social care services to deliver services for patients are also expected to join the Prime Minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “As the Prime Minister made clear this week, easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS is one of his key promises. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting branded the meeting a “talking shop”. The senior Labour figure said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor, a former Labour and Tony Blair aide, agreed with the criticism, saying the investment to improve discharge rates came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. He added: “Indeed, some local systems are still awaiting their allocation. “Any similar funding next year must be provided four to six months in advance so it can genuinely ease winter pressures.” On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet with union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year. However, Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen has told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” over the current settlement to prevent planned strikes. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll, of course, go to the meeting and make the case for nursing in all forums, but it’s sadly not what’s going to prevent strike action that’s planned for 10 days’ time. “I have put out an olive branch to get us to the table, I’m asking the Prime Minister now to meet the RCN halfway. The ball is firmly in the Prime Minister’s court.” A Department of Health and Social Care source said the Health Secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”.",Sunak to hold emergency No 10 talks in bid to ease winter care crisis,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/steve-barclay-matthew-taylor-nhs-wes-streeting-prime-minister-b2257731.html

The prime minister told health and social care leaders during an emergency summit in Downing Street on Saturday that it was a “collective responsibility” to free up hospital beds and slash ambulance waiting times. But Ms Cullen said his pledge will fail unless he gives her members a pay rise. She warned Mr Sunak the public would back nurses over the government if any were sacked as part of a new anti-strike crackdown and claimed the upcoming nurses’ walkout will be the biggest strike of its kind in the world. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Cullen also challenged the “out of touch” prime minister and health secretary Steve Barclay to work a 14-hour shift in a crisis-hit emergency ward. She said Mr Sunak could end the strikes this week if he takes up her offer to meet in the middle on pay, after saying she was willing to discuss a raise of 10 per cent instead of the 19 per cent originally asked for. During the crunch summit to solve the chaos engulfing English hospitals, Mr Sunak warned health leaders “business-as-usual mindset won’t fix the challenges we face”. England’s chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty and NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard were among those summoned for the rare weekend meeting. The prime minister is understood to be looking at ideas including the use of technology to help people stay out of hospital and increasing the number of “virtual wards”. He also highlighted that a small number of NHS trusts were responsible for a large proportion of serious issues, including long ambulance waits and waiting times for cancer care. Downing Street has said it will publish recovery plans to improve ambulance and A&E waiting times “in the coming weeks”. As Mr Sunak battles to bring the current crisis under control, Ms Cullen urged him to understand the scale of the upcoming nurses’ strike. A 48-hour walkout in England from 18 January will involve more hospitals than similar strikes last month’s action. She said: “We balloted around 320,000 nursing staff and my understanding is it has been the largest ballot of nursing staff in the world and it is the largest nursing strike in the world. We’ve also increased the number of organisations [such as NHS Trusts]. There are now 70 involved. First time around it was 46.” She also revealed that she had received messages of support from senior politicians in several European countries. December’s strikes were headline news in France, Italy, Spain and Austria among others. The world was “watching in dismay”, Ms Cullen said. She urged Mr Sunak to learn from the experience of other international leaders who were forced to back down in the face of ward walkouts, including Irish prime ministers in the first decade of this century. “What this government should look to is how the leader of [Ireland] stepped in very quickly and did not allow both of those strikes to go beyond the first few days,” she said. “And took immediate action. And that was because the public pressure was enormous.” On Wednesday, Mr Sunak set out his vision for the NHS, including a personal pledge to cut waiting lists. But he was criticised for offering nothing to end the current crisis or the strikes, which will also see ambulance staff take action later this month. “He made a broad, bold statement that he was going to cut waiting lists, but he won’t unless he addresses the crisis in nursing ... and the only way you are going to do that is to address the fundamental issue of nurses’ pay,” Ms Cullen said. Strike action will have to escalate if the government continues to ignore nurses, she said, although no decisions have yet been taken on what that would look like. Ms Cullen added: “He could bring it to a resolution this coming week – and avert industrial action. I will make myself available any night or any day. Let’s get round a table. Let’s have a discussion. “I think they owe that to the profession, to all those 320,000 nurses. And they owe it to every patient in this country, particularly those 7.2 million sitting on waiting lists year on year, to get around a table.” On Friday Mr Sunak refused to rule out that nurses could be sacked as part of his new crackdown, swerving the question in a broadcast interview. She described “any suggestion that they would sack any nurse… simply because nurses are standing up for their patients and the NHS” as “disheartening” given that there were currently 47,000 vacancies in the UK. Describing the prime minister as “out of touch” with the realities of the current crisis, she challenged Mr Sunak and his health secretary to work a 14-hour shift in an emergency department. She said: “From 7am to late into the evening, when a number of those hours will be unpaid, when the nurses should be off shift and home but they have no one to hand their patients on to. “They need to just walk in the shoes of those nurses for a few of those shifts. And I think that would make better decisions.” Leaving the NHS Recovery Forum on Saturday, consultant physician James Dunbar told reporters he was “confident that action will be taken” to address the crisis – but not optimistic it would be dealt with before spring. “These are difficult problems to fix though, so I think it’s unlikely we’ll have it sorted by the end of this winter,” he said. Dr Dunbar said that “a lot of” senior clinical leaders taking part were “saying the same thing”, adding: “The prime minister seemed to understand that.” Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Adrian Boyle meanwhile said the crisis is “fixable” and welcomed emergency care being “recognised as a priority”. A Downing Street spokesperson said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she added. A Department of Health and Social Care source said the health secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”. A government spokesperson said: “The health and social care secretary wants to have an honest conversation with unions, including the RCN, about what is affordable in pay settlements for next year during these challenging times, and is keen to meet for discussions as soon as possible. “We have accepted the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in full and have given over 1 million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. This is on top of a 3 per cent pay increase last year when public sector pay was frozen and wider government support with the cost of living.”",Rishi Sunak warned waiting list pledge will fail without NHS pay rise as he calls for ‘radical’ action,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/pat-cullen-nurses-rcn-strikes-b2257639.html

Here, we speak to just three of them. Volunteers at a vital community foodbank say that demand is surging with low-paid workers increasing reliant on it to make ends meet, writes Russell Blackstock. The facility at St Gregory’s Catholic Church, in Wyndford, Glasgow, is staffed entirely by unpaid helpers and is open five days a week. Unlike other foodbanks, St Gregory’s does not require users to provide a referral from an agency. It distributes free bags comprising up to 20 items including cereal, pasta, canned soup, tuna, tinned fruit, long-life milk and eggs. Toiletries, washing powder and washing-up liquid are also available. Co-ordinator Eileen Low said the number of people seeking help had soared by more than 30% since the pandemic’s peak while in the week before Christmas volunteers distributed a record number of bags. “We have just had our biggest ever week with 219 basic bags being handed out to help more than 500 individuals and families,” she said. “It is a grim new record to end the year with for us.” Low said that the foodbank’s clientele had also changed since the cost of living crisis started to bite this winter and many more working families were now seeking help. “When we started out five years ago, we were distributing between 30 and 40 bags weekly and it was usually to the most vulnerable people such as refugees, single pensioners and those with mental health or addiction issues,” she explained. “But now we are seeing more and more parents who have low-paid jobs such as cleaners and hospitality workers coming to us for help because they can’t pay the bills and feed their kids at the same time. “The working poor is a growing sector in our area and the government seems unable to do something constructive about it, so that’s where community-based charities come in. We are another safety net for people who are struggling financially and the authorities seem happy to let the likes of us pick up the slack. “It is obscene that this is happening in this day in age. At times we feel as though we are providing a new frontline service.” Ingrid Mitchell, who lives locally, has been volunteering at St Gregory’s for the past three years. She helps to shop for staples and hands out and delivers bags to foodbank users. The mother of two is a senior cabin crew member with a large airline, serving meals and drinks to passengers on transatlantic routes. She has been shocked by the surge in families seeking assistance from the foodbank. She said: “Many people feel embarrassed to ask for help but some have no other choice and they now rely on us. I have always been community minded and it is awful to see ordinary people in this situation. Sadly, I can’t see this crisis easing any time soon.” ‘We are warm and can offer a respite to what is going on’ No longer just a place to borrow books or study for exams, libraries are introducing a range of activities, clubs and groups to create “warm and welcoming spaces” that people can utilise during the cost of living crisis, writes Alice Hinds. From movie matinees and craft groups to mindful colouring-in sessions for adults and regular coffee mornings, library leaders say such innovative services provide a vital lifeline for people in the community who would otherwise struggle to find warm, comfortable and, importantly, free places to spend time during winter months. Ray Pattie, library adviser at Edinburgh Central Library, says the centres have always provided support for communities but new groups have become increasingly popular for people who may feel isolated or worried about spending money while socialising. “Our users see libraries as safe and reliable spaces,” he explained. “People just don’t have the disposable income now for sitting in Costa for hours and hours – that can turn into an expensive week, so they are looking for other things to do outside of the home. “That’s why we’re providing things like Knit And Natter, a weekly craft group, and adult colouring-in sessions, too. “The activities give people an opportunity to still come out and spend time with other people in a warm space but it’s more affordable than visiting a cafe. It’s an opportunity to meet new people as well. Since I’ve worked in libraries, it has very much been all about the community.” As well as introducing social groups, many of the Scottish capital’s libraries have also added social spaces to encourage people to visit for as long as they like. Replicating a living room with plants, comfortable seating, warm lighting and coffee tables, the areas also have free-to-use jigsaws and board games and a number of libraries have also included self-help guides on topics such as energy and money saving, and cooking on a budget. Hana Mackechnie, lifelong learning service manager for libraries in Edinburgh, said: “Some of our libraries are open 52 hours a week and you don’t need to come for a particular reason. “We’re finding that people want a space where they can spend a little bit longer, and somewhere they can also find signposting to benefits they might be entitled to, or get advice on how to access particular services. If you are a reader, you probably already feel like you’re welcome in a library but there’s so much more going on and we’re trying to introduce more activities.” Every weekday during winter, libraries across Edinburgh are also hosting movie matinees with free teas, coffees and refreshments, giving people another way to keep warm for a few hours. Acting library supervisor Natasha Gibson added: “We were already providing or about to introduce these initiatives but the situation now has brought more of a need for them and highlighted just how valuable they are for the community. “People are becoming more aware that, yes, libraries are also a place to come and be social and have a few minutes of respite from whatever is going on in life. “People do come to the library specifically to chat to people or get a change of scenery and at the moment it’s a much-needed place away from home that’s warm – both in terms of the physical surroundings and the people that are here.” ‘It is sad to see so many people struggling’ Demand for free furniture, school uniforms and even haircuts is on the rise at a community-based initiative in south-west Scotland, writes Russell Blackstock. The Furniture Project in Stranraer was originally set up to recycle, repair and provide refurbished household goods at affordable prices. But the charity, which has more than 20 volunteers and runs two shops, has also turned to providing household items and services for free to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. “We started running Freebie Friday events that are proving to be hugely popular,” said boss Paul Smith. “These include giving away items like furniture and household appliances and demand has been high. “So many low-income workers who wouldn’t normally be struggling are now coming to us because the price of everything has risen so much that they simply can’t make ends meet. “I suppose we are doing what the likes of parish organisations and local authorities might have done in the past.” Other popular services provided by the charity include organising free school uniforms and haircuts for children whose parents are struggling to get by. “A new school blazer alone can cost between £40 and £50 and if you have three kids in the house, that is a big expense for any family,” said Smith. “People can come to our shop and discreetly get a school uniform for nothing, and we run this service all through the school year. We have also started a project involving local hairdressers so that kids can get haircuts for free because, again, this can be expensive if you have a number of children in the house. “We try to help to make sure that these kids don’t feel any different from friends at school who come from better-off backgrounds. “It is sad to see so many people struggling financially at the moment but I grew up on a housing scheme that was regarded as being poor and we had to put up with hand-me-downs, so I know what that is like.” The organisation also recycles bicycles and gifts that would usually go to landfill, and sells them cheaply to people once they have been refurbished. Also, it provides a mentoring service that enables retired people to pass on skills and knowledge to youngsters so that they can find jobs in areas such as warehousing and customer services. Smith said even middle-income families were now using the project to inexpensively replace big-ticket household items such as fridges, cookers and furniture as the cost of living crisis deepens. He added: “Previously, you could almost categorise those using services like ours as being among the most vulnerable in our community but the financial pressures are now adding up for people right across the board. “We are now increasingly helping the sort of folk that we normally wouldn’t expect to see.”","Community foodbank: In this day and age, it is obscene we are so needed as a safety net for people",https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/foodbanks-warmbanks/

Being the prime minister, he must have thought, has to amount to more than acknowledging a terrifying array of looming crises. When asked what you hope to do with your time in office, you’ve got to give a more inspiring answer than “cope”, even if you’re fortunate in following a leader who didn’t even manage that. What would be a clear, constructive, positive, yet achievable, initiative? Nothing fun at this bleak time – any whiff of levity could be accused of trivialising people’s suffering. And nothing that sounds expensive. Also nothing that sounds too leftwing, what with the Tory right calling Sunak a socialist for failing to cut taxes. But nothing that sounds too rightwing either, what with the Labour party being so far ahead in the polls. Plus there are many subject areas to avoid: health, transport, defence, the economy… Probably best if it doesn’t touch on any other countries, what with Brexit being such a sore point and China getting horribler and Russia obviously. And there’s the whole illegal immigration shitstorm, so maybe steer clear of abroad altogether. Also food and fuel and housing would be good areas not to mention. Plus it shouldn’t be something that sounds difficult or people won’t believe it’s going to happen. And it shouldn’t be anything that anyone cares too much about because, its achievability notwithstanding, it still probably won’t happen. What should it be? I’d have been stumped. My best idea was: “Every hard-working family will be given a free cactus.” They could sit on kitchen tables, as symbols of bristly resilience, while people try to work out how to pay the mortgages on their freezing homes. Little green shoots of spiny recovery sprouting all over an economic wasteland. Sunak went another way. He fell back on something he could rely on, the solace of many a swot in the face of moral complexity, myself included: maths. You know where you are with maths. Maths doesn’t let you down. Maths doesn’t go on strike, or arrive uninvited on the south coast, or die because it couldn’t get an ambulance, or send bullying texts, or appear on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. Let’s do more maths! That was his new initiative. Everyone should be studying maths until the age of 18, he declared. Who can argue with that? Eight million adults in the UK are only numerate to primary school level. That’s bad. But brilliantly, all those potential voters, who presumably hate maths, won’t have to do any at all, but only agree with the principle that they should have done more previously. No one who can vote will have to do anything they don’t want to. This is an entirely inoffensive policy. The education secretary, who my investigations tell me is called Gillian Keegan, might feel aggrieved that it doesn’t leave her with much to say in her next speech. Michael Gove used to have great fun with that brief – handing out bibles and making everyone read Thomas Hardy and memorise dates – and even Gavin Williamson got to cancel everyone’s exams. The importance of maths should be something Keegan gets to bang on about to easy applause, but the PM has nicked it because every single other policy area has gone toxic. But he was determined to make it sound massive: “This is personal for me,” it was reported that he was “expected to say” in his speech. And he did! “It’s the single most important reason why I came into politics: to give every child the highest possible standard of education.” Wow – it turns out he’s a stealth educationist. He was also expected to say: “Just half of all 16-19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills is letting our children down.” Admirable sentiments, though the phrase “our children’s jobs” raises the spectre of child labour. An unfortunate slip when families are struggling to afford food and fuel and the sick are left untreated. It’s all getting a bit Dickensian. But perhaps it’s deliberate. Is this heritage austerity? Back to when Britain was great? Perhaps by “studying maths” he means “doing data entry”? Good work for children with their nimble fingers, and much safer than picking fluff out of an industrial loom, so we must count our blessings. It was a slip because, of all the things he was “expected to say”, the phrase about “children’s jobs” was the only one he didn’t. Very wise. Bless him, he just wanted to say “children” as many times as possible. A focus group must have generated that finding: saying “children” is a good look for him. Better than for Truss the malfunctioning robot or Johnson the philanderer, who just kept having children. Sunak’s children look nice – he’s shared some lovely photos – it’s a relatable family unit. Keep saying “children”, Rishi, and people will believe you care. I approve of the maths plan, but it’s such a tiny thought. In most countries that we increasingly laughably consider our equivalents, maths up to the age of 18 has long been compulsory. Rather than having an idea, he’s just picked one of myriad ways in which Britain is worse than elsewhere and resolved to correct it. It’s like saying: “We really ought to start brushing our teeth.” A small, long-overdue correction to our educational practices coming from the leader of a party that’s been in power for 12 years. It’s lame. And it won’t happen. Sunak says he “will work with the sector to move towards all children studying some form of maths to 18”. “Work with” to “move towards”. Christ. Don’t hold your breath. As Keegan’s shadow, Bridget Phillipson, put it: “He cannot deliver this reheated, empty pledge without more maths teachers, yet the government has missed their target for new maths teachers year after year.” More teachers requires more money. The money must either be raised or moved from elsewhere. That means fewer missiles or nurses or tax cuts or more taxes. Perhaps maths will let him down after all.",More maths?

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and Aslef took industrial action which crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Union leaders will meet rail minister Huw Merriman as they continue to insist the Government is blocking a deal to end the long-running row over pay, jobs and conditions. Transport Secretary Mark Harper denies the allegation, saying he is facilitating talks between unions and employers.

Last year was chaotic for domestic politics, with upheaval at Westminster and long-running argument at Holyrood on the constitution. Here are just five of the big problems and promises you want sorted for 2023. 1. Fix the NHS NHS Grampian took the desperate step of putting out an urgent social media appeal for staff off-duty or on holiday to come in to work over the festive period. And NHS Highland has warned Raigmore and Belford Hospitals are “very busy” and expressed concerns over a surge in flu patients. Patients across the north and north-east have also struggled to access their GP with one Aberdeen doctor revealing he is seeing three times the safe number of patients “on an almost-daily basis”. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf is facing mounting pressure to come forward with a recovery plan. He says Covid backlogs, rising cases of flu and Strep A, delayed discharged and cold weather are “all compounding” the usual pressures on the health service. The SNP minister is expected to deliver a statement addressing concerns at Holyrood on Tuesday. Meanwhile, NHS Grampian is waiting for an extra £7 million a year required to help more Moray women give birth in Elgin. Campaigners in Caithness continue to raise concerns over the lack of women’s healthcare in the county, with women facing 100-mile journeys to Inverness for treatment. 2. Will the A9 and A96 be dualled? It was confirmed just days before Christmas that a final decision on fully dualling the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness will not be made until well into next year. The SNP promised over a decade ago to dual the route by 2030. But this was thrown into doubt when the Scottish Greens were brought into government in 2021. An open survey of P&J readers, published on January 6, revealed the vast majority of respondents want the A96 dualled all the way. A project to dual the A9 between Inverness and Perth has also been hit by serious delays but the government has yet to give an update on its 2025 target completion date. Pressure on the SNP Government is intensifying after 13 people died on the stretch due to be dualled between the two cities. 3. We need better ferries Furious islanders from the Hebrides to Shetland have warned locals are packing up and quitting their communities in response to the “utterly chaotic” ferry system. The construction of two new ferries, MV Glen Sannox and Hull 802, is well behind schedule and over budget. The vessels, which were originally commissioned in 2015 from struggling shipyard Fergus Marine, are now years late and over a hundred million pounds over budget. The Holyrood inquiry continues but already the SNP is promising more. 4. Whatever happened to Freeports? Three locations across the north-east, Highlands and islands are vying for “green freeport” status from the UK and Scottish governments. Freeports get special tax status and are being promoted as job-creating goldmines. Others fear they are light on regulation and attractive to money launderers. A joint bid by Aberdeen and Peterhead ports is going up against bids by Cromarty Firth and Orkney for the two coveted spots. But bidders have been left in the dark since the summer over who will secure the special tax status, with Scottish Secretary Alister Jack admitting months ago that a decision has already been made. It is understood the ever-changing leadership of the Tory party delayed the announcement last year. 5. What is the future for oil and gas? The SNP conference in October seemed to finally push the future of oil and gas workers to the top of the agenda. Taking place in Aberdeen, Ms Sturgeon said her government has a “duty” to support workers into new green jobs. But there has been a lack of detail on the practicalities. Energy Secretary Michael Matheson is slated to deliver a statement on Scotland’s long-awaited energy strategy and “just transition” plan on Tuesday. The latter will focus on the offshore workforce, Mr Matheson told the Press and Journal last year. Energy policy is reserved to the UK Government and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will have a key role in charting the future of the oil and gas sector, from the licensing of future oil fields to the windfall tax.",5 problems people across the north of Scotland want politicians to fix in 2023,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/5243446/nhs-freeports-a9-a96-oil-gas-ferries/

Growing demand in energy markets in both North America and the Middle East are also driving the business forward, it said. Ace Winches, whose many accolades over the years include prestigious Queen’s Awards in 2010 and 2013, has formed a subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates as part of its global growth strategy. And earlier this year it announced the opening of a subsidiary in Houston, Texas. Underlying earnings up 38% Chairman Alfie Cheyne said a strong financial performance during the 12 months to March 31 last year was a foundation “which bodes well for the future”. The company reported pre-tax profits of £4.5 million – down from £7.8m for the previous year, when results were boosted by the reversal of a £4.8m write-down. Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation raced ahead to £7.6m last year, up by 38% from £5.5m previously. Ownership tussle The most recent figure excludes one-off costs associated with a change of ownership, Turnover increased slightly to £28.3m, up from just shy of £28m the year before. Ace Winches’ 58-year-old chairman founded the business in 1992 but lost control of it to Balmoral Group in stages between 2017 and 2019. The relationship with Aberdeen-based Balmoral eventually turned sour and Mr Cheyne and his wife, Valerie, reacquired the firm in late 2021. Reflecting on 2021-22, Mr Cheyne said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. “It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is.” He added: “In this reporting period we have made an additional investment of £1.3m in our rental fleet in line with our twin objectives of diversification and geographic expansion. “It has been a year marked by significant growth and change – growth in the renewables market and a change in how we interact with our customers. “This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet, thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Green ambitions Mr Cheyne also highlighted the firm’s green credentials after it became carbon neutral. Operations at Towie Barclay Works are now powered by wind. On the firm’s wider green ambitions, chief commercial officer Gary Wilson said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East are indicators of our strategy going forward.” With more than 3,000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, Ace Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and other services in multiple sectors. Headcount averaged 155 during the 12 months to March 2022, down from 171 the year before. Mrs Cheyne, chief compliance officer, said the company was growing its workforce again. She added: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our graduate engineer numbers, providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.”",Ace Winches sets sights on global growth after &#8216;strong&#8217; results,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/local/5245423/ace-winches-sets-sights-on-global-growth-after-strong-results/

Earlier, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “happy to talk about pay” with unions as ministers held a series of meetings aimed at ending a wave of industrial unrest in the NHS and on the rail network. However, both the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” Unite said any suggestion that a one-off pay reward could be made in exchange for a boost in productivity was “absolutely ludicrous”. While other trade unions said that “progress” had been made, there was no sign that enough had been made for planned strikes to be called off. Unite negotiator Onay Kasab, speaking after a meeting with Mr Barclay, accused the Government of telling staff they would need to “justify” a payment through productivity. “This isn’t a factory we’re talking about, we’re talking about people who are working well beyond their contracted hours anyway just to get the job done because they care so much. “So, for the Government to be talking about productivity in exchange for a (payment) is an insult to every single one of our members.” Mr Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. Alongside talks with health unions, teaching unions were holding talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan ahead of announcements this week over whether their members will go on strike. Rail minister Huw Merriman called in train workers after sustained action crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Mr Kasab said: “I emphasise the thing to get out of today that is absolutely clear is that they want our members to give more in order for it to consider a payment. That is absolutely outrageous.” He said there had been no “detailed” discussion of what a pay settlement might look like, adding that the talks had left him “very angry”. He added: “The Government have missed yet another opportunity. We came here in good faith.” After the meeting, the GMB said that ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday, adding that the talks “fell well short” of anything needed to stop the walk-out. More than 10,000 GMB members are expected by the trade union to take to picket lines on Wednesday. “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis,” said Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary. “The public expects the Government to treat these talks seriously – it’s time they got on with it.” Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, told reporters that “progress” had been made but said there had been no “tangible” concessions. “It was a very civil meeting. We did actually manage to talk about pay – we didn’t get the tangible concessions that we might have hoped for that would enable us to call off the strikes later this week. “But it was definitely progress when you’re in a room with the Secretary of State talking about pay, I think. “He’s asked for our help to help with the Treasury to make the case for investment. We’ll certainly do that.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks. Elaine Sparkes, assistant director at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Although the meeting was more constructive this time, there is nothing tangible on the table. “As such, we’ll be announcing the first of our strike dates later this week as we continue to push for a fairer deal for our members and their colleagues.” The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement. On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”. “On pay, we’ve always said that the Government is happy to talk about pay demands and pay issues that are anchored in what’s reasonable, what’s responsible, what’s affordable for the country.” Downing Street earlier warned that concerns about inflation had not gone away as the Government prepares for the next round of pay talks for 2023/24. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Government was open to listening to trade unions’ concerns. “We are happy to listen to the pressures they think they are under, what they think is fair, responsible and affordable, and likewise we will provide detail about what we think is affordable, and also the challenge that inflation poses to all of this as well.” Elsewhere, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch dodged questions about progress in rail talks but said that further discussions would take place. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, gave a shrugging gesture as he left the Department for Transport but also declined to give any detail of the meeting. The National Education Union said that “no concrete progress” had been made in its talks with the education secretary. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “While there is the thought of further meetings, there is no sense of concrete progress as yet. There is no offer, there is no change. “There are further discussions to happen that we will engage in while still urging our members to vote in the ballot.” Mr Courtney added: “There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action because we think these meetings are only happening because of the threat of industrial action.” Business Secretary Grant Shapps has said ministers were seeking a more “collaborative approach”, telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “It is a new year. We are very keen to see these strikes come to a conclusion. We want to see a collaborative approach.”",Strikes set to go ahead after ‘insulting’ talks with Health Secretary,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/strikes-set-to-go-ahead-after-insulting-talks-with-health-secretary-b2258736.html

The company, which earlier this year announced the opening of ACE Winches Inc. in Houston, Texas, reported a pre-tax profit of £4.5m, while there was also a slight increase in turnover to £28.3m. ACE Winches Chairman Alfie Cheyne, who, in 2021, returned to the organisation he founded, said the performance gives the company a strong platform to build from. He said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. ""It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is.

As part of that ambition, ACE has formed a subsidiary company in the United Arab Emirates, ensuring the range of high-quality services from concept design through to manufacture, equipment rental and further support, is delivered globally. Chief Commercial Officer Gary Wilson​ said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East, are indicators of our strategy going forward, as we place a focus on areas of opportunity where our capabilities and solutions single us out as a contractor of choice. “We have a strong reputation that has been built up through our commitment to innovation and investing in our people and services over the last 30 years, and we are looking forward to bringing that expertise to more of our customers in North America and the Middle East, as well as markets we already serve.” With more than 3000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, ACE Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and deploying solutions across multiple sectors.

The Jamesfield development is a joint venture with Harmony Energy, following TagEnergy’s acquisition of a 60% stake in the project in November 2021. It will use a system of Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries, together with Tesla’s Autobidder software for real-time trading and control. It is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter this year, with renewable energy company RES as asset manager. Franck Woitiez, chief executive of TagEnergy, said the company's third battery energy storage facility in the UK reinforced its commitment to the country and its green energy goals. “This is another important milestone in TagEnergy’s growth in the UK as we leverage our strong storage expertise to support the UK grid and propel the nation to net-zero carbon emissions by connecting more competitive renewable power. “We are excited to enter this next phase in the project in partnership with Harmony Energy and with the support of Santander UK as we grow our UK footprint to accelerate the energy transition.” Mark Cumbo, director of specialised and project finance at Santander UK, said: “This follows the funding we provided TagEnergy in 2021 to support Hawkers Hill Energy Park in Dorset, and to TagEnergy and Harmony Energy in 2022 for Chapel Farm near Luton. “Santander UK strongly supports clients such as TagEnergy and Harmony Energy that are bringing additional capacity to enable greater contribution from renewables to the UK’s energy sector.” Peter Kavanagh, chief executive of Harmony Energy, said: “We have been working on this site for over four years and are delighted to be progressing to this next stage with TagEnergy, following our partnership which was announced in 2021. “Securing debt funding from Santander UK demonstrates a growing appetite from institutions to support battery developments and we look forward to working with it.” Jamesfield is the third TagEnergy investment in battery storage facilities in the UK to reach financial close following its entry into the UK market in 2021. Commissioning of its first project, Hawkers Hill Energy Park, took place in September and construction of its second project, Chapel Farm, started last February. Jamesfield, Chapel Farm and Hawkers Hill, together with previously-announced projects Roaring Hill in Fife, Lakeside in North Yorkshire and more recently, Pitkevy in Scotland, take TagEnergy’s secured portfolio in the UK to date to 320MW/640MWh. TagEnergy partnered with Balance Power in October to build, own, and operate 500MW of Balance Power’s renewable energy pipeline requiring an investment of more than £300m over the next four years. Since its formation in 2019, TagEnergy has assembled a portfolio of close to 4GW based on solar, wind and battery storage technologies in the UK, Portugal, Spain, France and Australia.

It follows recent articles on inflation, energy, food and the cost of living. Canada: assertive unions getting results Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Canada’s trade union movement is among the more resilient in the OECD, the club of developed countries. This is related to laws that prevent “free riding”, which is where workers can benefit from collective agreements without being union members. Union density in Canada has been around 30% of workers since the turn of the century, although membership in the private sector is barely half that and slowly falling. In contrast, unionisation is high in public services (over 75%) and growing. This relatively stability has left Canadian workers better prepared to confront the impact of inflation on their wages. Unions made higher wage demands than in recent decades, and more frequently went on strike (continuing a trend from 2021). From January to October 2022, there were 145 strikes, and the final year tally will likely exceed the 161 in 2021 – itself a marked increase. A total of 1.9 million person-days of work were lost in strikes up to October (the highest in 15 years). Unlike in recent years, the majority were in the private sector. A spring wave of strikes in construction in Ontario (Canada’s most populous province) symbolised the increased militancy. At peak, over 40,000 workers downed tools for higher wages, including carpenters, dry-wallers and engineers. Tentative agreements reached by officials were sometimes rejected by members, prolonging the strikes. A second historic flash point came later in the year when Ontario’s right-wing government invoked a rarely used constitutional clause to override the right to strike for 55,000 education support workers. After unions in the public and private sector threatened a province-wide general strike, the government backed down. Meanwhile, employer lockouts have virtually disappeared. This tactic, in which employers suspend operations until workers agree to terms being offered, had only been used eight times by October, compared to 60 per year a decade ago. Annual wage growth increased modestly to an average of 5% by late in the year. That still lagged the 6.8% inflation, but closed the gap from 2021. It remains to be seen whether this union pressure can be sustained in the face of rapid interest rate increases, a likely recession in 2023, and continued government suppression of union rights in some provinces. United Kingdom: an olive branch for the health service? Phil Tomlinson, Professor of Industrial Strategy, University of Bath The UK’s latest winter of discontent is extending into 2023 as the country endures its largest wave of strikes in over 30 years. Most are in the public sector, where pay offers are well below inflation and significantly lag private companies. The sense of grievance is high following the austerity and real-terms pay cuts of the 2010s. Strikes – estimated to have cost the UK economy £1.7 billion in 2022 – are being co-ordinated across different unions, adding to the public inconvenience. The UK government has steadfastly refused to yield, however. It has hidden behind independent recommendations by public-sector pay review bodies, despite not always following them. They have also claimed that inflation matching public sector pay rises would cost each UK household an extra £1,000 a year, though this figure has been debunked. The Treasury also echoes Bank of England concerns about setting off a wage-price spiral. Yet this is unlikely, given the current inflation is largely down to supply shocks (from COVID and the war in Ukraine), while average wage growth is well below inflation. There is an economic case for a generous deal, especially in the National Health Service (NHS): with over 133,000 unfilled vacancies, better wages might help improve staff retention and recruitment. Of course, funding this in a recession involves tough choices. Higher taxes would be politically difficult with the tax burden at a 70-year high. Higher government borrowing could aggravate inflation if accommodated by the Bank of England increasing the money supply through more quantitative easing. Public opinion appears largely sympathetic to the strikes, especially in the NHS. But if the government relents in one sector, it sets a precedent for others, with potentially wider economic consequences. For the NHS, it may instead bring forward public sector pay review body negotiations for 2023 to allow for an improved deal – possibly alongside a one-off hardship payment. Elsewhere it will probably hold firm and hope the trade unions lose their resolve. Australia and New Zealand: strikes remain rare despite inflation Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Strikes in Australia have become very rare in recent decades, thanks to restrictive labour laws passed since the 1990s. Despite historically low unemployment and wages lagging far behind inflation, these laws continue to short-circuit most industrial action. In 2022, union density fell to 12.5% of employees, an all-time low. As recently as 1990, union density was over 50% of workers. Union members can legally strike only after negotiations, ballots and specific plans for action have been publicly divulged (thus fully revealing union strategy to the employer). Even when there are strikes, they tend to be short. A total of 182 industrial disputes occurred in the year to September. (The statistics don’t distinguish between strikes and employer lockouts, which have become common in Australia.) This is similar to the pre-COVID years, following a drop in 2020, and only a fraction of 1970s and 1980s industrial action. The only visible increase in strike action in 2022 was a series of one-day protest strikes organised by teachers and health care workers in New South Wales, the country’s most populous state. Having put up with a decade of austere wage caps by the conservative state government, they decided they had had enough as inflation picked up. Most other workers have been passive despite Australia experiencing among the slowest wage growth of any major industrial country. Nominal wages grew just 2% per year over the decade to 2021. That rose to 3.1% by late 2022, but it’s still less than half the 7.3% inflation rate. Australia’s newly elected Labor government did pass a series of important labour law reforms at the end of 2022, aimed at strengthening collective bargaining and wage growth. That might herald incremental improvement in workers’ bargaining power in the years ahead. The industrial relations outlook in New Zealand is somewhat more hospitable for workers and their unions. Union density increased in 2021, to 17% of employees (from 14% in 2020). Average ordinary hourly earnings grew an impressive 7.4% in the latest 12-month period – helped by a 6% boost in the minimum wage by New Zealand’s Labour government. Industrial action remains rare – perhaps in part because workers are successfully lifting wages via other means. No official strike data is available for 2022, but in 2021, just 20 work stoppages occurred, down sharply from an average of 140 per year in the previous three years. Indonesia: anger against labour law reforms Nabiyla Risfa Izzati, Lecturer of Labour Law, Universitas Gadjah Mada A few weeks ago, the government replaced its controversial “omnibus law” with new emergency regulation. This was in response to the Indonesian constitutional court finding it unconstitutional in 2021. Passed in late 2020, the omnibus law embodies President Joko Widodo’s ambition to attract foreign investors by slashing red tape at the cost of employees’ rights. It made it easier for businesses to lay off employees without prior notice. It also lowered statutory severance pay and extended the maximum length of temporary contracts, while ignoring worker safety. In 2022, its new formula to determine the minimum wage also resulted in the lowest annual increase ever. The law attracted much criticism from workers, activists and civil society organisations. The new emergency regulation is arguably even more problematic. The majority of its provision simply copies the omnibus law. Several changes and additional provisions are confusing and overlap with previous regulations, as well as leaving many loopholes that could be exploited in future. Yet despite complaints from workers and trade unions that the new rules were passed suddenly and without consultation, strike action is out of the question. Strikes are not popular because they can only be organised with permission from the company in question. If labourers hold informal strikes, employers also entitled to get rid of them. Public protests are the obvious alternative, though pandemic rules restricting mobility and mass gatherings have made these difficult. Nevetheless, thousands or perhaps even millions of workers staged protests in their respective cities in the second half of 2022. The workers wanted the omnibus law revoked, and for the government to not use the minimum wage formulations stipulated in the law. The demonstrations got more intense as the government raised subsidised fuel prices in September, which boosted already high inflation due to rising food prices. The government has since issued a separate regulation to determine the 2023 minimum wage, so the demands were successful, although both workers and employers are furious that the minimum wage rules have changed again under the emergency regulation. Clearly the protesters did not see the rest of the rules in the omnibus law removed. Some workers have been protesting on social media. This might not induce the government to change the law, but a few viral tweets have pushed several businesses to change abusive practices. The controversy is likely to continue in 2023 and into the election year of 2024, especially amid possible massive layoffs in the midst of a global recession. United States: worker protest showing signs of life Marick Masters, Professor of Business and Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Wayne State University US workers organised and took to the picket line in increased numbers in 2022 to demand better pay and working conditions, leading to optimism among labour leaders and advocates that they’re witnessing a turnaround in labour’s sagging fortunes. Teachers, journalists and baristas were among tens of thousands of workers who went on strike. And it took an act of Congress to prevent 115,000 railroad employees from walking out as well. In total, there have been at least 20 major work stoppages involving upwards of 1,000 workers each in 2022, up from 16 in 2021, plus hundreds more that were smaller. Workers at Starbucks, Amazon, Apple and dozens of other companies also filed over 2,000 petitions to form unions during the year – the most since 2015. Workers won 76% of the 1,363 elections that were held. Historically, however, these figures are tepid. The number of major work stoppages has been plunging for decades, from nearly 200 as recently as 1980. As of 2021, union membership was at about the lowest level on record, at 10.3%. In the 1950s, over one in three workers belonged to a union. The deck is still heavily stacked against unions, with unsupportive labour laws and very few employers showing real receptivity to having a unionised workforce. Unions are limited in how much they can change public policy. Reforming labour law through legislation has remained elusive, and the results of the 2022 midterms are not likely to make it easier. Nonetheless, public support for labour is at its highest since 1965, with 71% saying they approve of unions, according to a Gallup poll in August. And workers themselves are increasingly showing an interest in joining them. In 2017, 48% of workers polled said they would vote for union representation, up from 32% in 1995, the last time the question was asked. Future success may depend on unions’ ability to tap into their growing popularity and emulate the recent wins in establishing union representation at Starbucks and Amazon, as well as the successful “Fight for $15” campaign, which since 2012 has helped pass US$15 minimum wage laws in a dozen states and Washington DC. The odds may be steep, but the seeds of opportunity are there if labour can exploit them. This is an excerpt from an article published on January 5 2023. France: militant unions risk going too far Stéphanie Matteudi-Lecocq, Chercheuse au LEREDS, Directrice practice Chez Alixio, Université de Lille France in 2022 saw new industrial protests, from blockades of oil refineries, to unprecedented strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants, to rail workers staying at home on public holidays. TotalEnergies announced “super profits” in the second quarter of 2022 and increased CEO Patrick Pouyanné’s salary by 52% to €5,944,129. In September the militant CGT union demanded a 10% salary increase for workers and called for a strike at the group’s refineries. Five of Total’s refineries went on strike, joined by two owned by ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso. Esso was already talking to its unions about a pay deal, but Total had only planned to open negotiations in November. The strikes in the refineries threatened to bring France to a standstill, and the CGT used its power over this key resource to demand that discussions begin more quickly with Total (in the end, the company negotiated earlier and pay deals were done, ending the strikes by early November). The strike at EDF’s nuclear power stations similarly gave the company’s workers the balance of power because it made it impossible for France to build up energy reserves (since fossil fuels had to be burned to make up for the lack of nuclear power). In the end, the company signed deals with the unions in October. Unions may have succeeded in both cases, but they are arguably endangered by these kinds of practices. Too many trades union leaders remain stuck in their old militant ways. There’s a fragile balance between negotiation and protest, and such ransom tactics might damage unions’ public image, making dialogue more difficult in future. In 50 years, the rate of unionisation in France has already halved from over 20% to around 10%. It’s telling that two of the major strikes at the end of 2022, first by train workers and then by general practitioners, were initiated by groups independent from the unions. They both started spontaneously through social media and the unions found out very late. In 2023 the unions have an opportunity to improve their influence if they manage to prevent the government from passing its unpopular bill on pensions, which seeks to raise the full pensionable retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65. The unions have already announced their strong opposition to the bill. With major demonstrations due to take place after the full bill is presented today, January 10, it will be interesting to see their tactics. This is based on an excerpt from an article published in October 2022. Spain: unequal support measures could cause trouble Rubén Garrido-Yserte, Director del Instituto Universitario de Análisis Económico y Social, Universidad de Alcalá Global inflation is triggering a global economic slowdown and interest rates raised to levels not seen since before 2008. Interest rates will continue to rise in 2023, especially affecting economies as indebted as Spain. It will undermine both families’ disposable income and the profitability of companies (especially small ones), while making public debt repayments more expensive. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to cause a sustained increase in the cost of the shopping basket in the medium term. Government measures have partially mitigated this loss of purchasing power so far. Spain capped power prices, subsidised fuel and made public transport free for urbanites and commuters. There were agreements with banks to refinance mortgages for the most vulnerable families. Plus there have been increases in pensions and public salaries and there are plans to raise the minimum wage. However, many of these measures must necessarily be temporary. The danger is that they come to be seen as rights that should not be renounced. They also distort the economy and create problems with fairness by excluding or insufficiently supporting some groups. Private salaries will not rise enough to cover inflation, for instance. The government’s measures have been such that there has been very little industrial action in response to the cost of living crisis. The danger is that they create a scenario where today’s calm may be the harbinger of a social storm tomorrow.

Ms Somerville said there is still “some distance” between the two sides in the pay dispute. On Tuesday, primary schools around the country closed after last-ditch talks failed to prevent strike action, with secondary school staff set to walk out on Wednesday. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. A meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT), which brings together unions, local authorities and the Scottish Government, took place on Monday in an attempt to avert the strike action. As the Scottish Parliament resumed following the winter recess, Conservative Stephen Kerr spoke about the SNCT meeting. He said: “Teachers are on strike for the first time in 40 years, because this SNP Government has repeatedly let them down.” Ms Somerville said it had been “constructive”, adding that she could not give further details while negotiations are ongoing. Referring to “anti-trade union” legislation at Westminster, she continued: “I will take no lectures from Mr Kerr or any other Conservative member of this parliament, saying that we should be doing more to actually settle disputes.” The Lib Dems’ Willie Rennie asked if there would be a new offer for teachers, saying: “The Education Secretary does seem to be very chilled out and relaxed.” Ms Somerville said both sides in the dispute would have to compromise in order to reach a resolution, adding: “We will, of course, leave no stone unturned to try and do that as quickly as possible. “No one wants to see strike action in our schools.” Speaking on BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland programme earlier, Ms Somerville described the union pay demands as “simply unaffordable”. After talks ended in failure, members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), NASUWT, Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association (SSTA) and the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS) are taking strike action. It follows SSTA and NASUWT members taking two days of action in December while EIS members walked out on November 24. Asked whether she expected a new offer to be on the table before the end of the week, Ms Somerville said: “We’ll continue discussions with the unions. “I think the challenge that we have is we remain some distance apart on what the Scottish Government and local government can afford and can put on the table from the union demand which is, of course, a 10% increase in pay. “If that had been accepted, if the 5% had been accepted, you would’ve actually seen teachers have a 21.8% cumulative rise since 2018. “So we’re trying very hard to have a fair and affordable package on the table but we do remain unfortunately some distance apart.” She added: “The pay demands we’re having from our trade union colleagues are simply unaffordable for the Scottish Government working on a fixed budget, already allocated, also eroded by inflation and that does make it a very difficult and challenging process to come to a conclusion and resolution on.” Earlier in the programme, Mike Corbett, NASUWT Scotland national official, echoed the concerns that unions and Government were still far away from agreement on pay. He said the last offer made in November was “dressed up as an improved offer” but did not improve pay for the “vast majority of teachers”. He added: “There’s still no formal revised offer on the table and that is the reason why our members and others feel they’ve got no alternative but to be out on strike again today and tomorrow.” Nicola Sturgeon also spoke to journalists about the strike on Tuesday. The First Minister said: “I deeply regret that we have industrial action in our schools. “I don’t think that’s in the interest of young people at all. “That said, I understand the strength of feeling of teachers and we highly value the teaching profession.” However, she said: “I can’t create additional funding that we don’t have and I’ve tried to be really honest with unions across the public sector. “We’re trying to be as fair as possible while maximising pay increases.”",Somerville: No stone will be left unturned in bid to resolve school strikes,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/scottish-government-teachers-education-secretary-scottish-parliament-conservative-b1052061.html

Shirley-Anne Somerville responded to questions from opposition MSPs about the ongoing industrial action, with one accusing her of being “chilled out and relaxed”. Ms Somerville said there is still “some distance” between the two sides in the pay dispute. On Tuesday, primary schools around the country closed after last-ditch talks failed to prevent strike action, with secondary school staff set to walk out on Wednesday. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. A meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT), which brings together unions, local authorities and the Scottish Government, took place on Monday in an attempt to avert the strike action. As the Scottish Parliament resumed following the winter recess, Conservative Stephen Kerr spoke about the SNCT meeting. He said: “Teachers are on strike for the first time in 40 years, because this SNP Government has repeatedly let them down.” Ms Somerville said it had been “constructive”, adding that she could not give further details while negotiations are ongoing. Referring to “anti-trade union” legislation at Westminster, she continued: “I will take no lectures from Mr Kerr or any other Conservative member of this parliament, saying that we should be doing more to actually settle disputes.” The Lib Dems’ Willie Rennie asked if there would be a new offer for teachers, saying: “The Education Secretary does seem to be very chilled out and relaxed.” Ms Somerville said both sides in the dispute would have to compromise in order to reach a resolution, adding: “We will, of course, leave no stone unturned to try and do that as quickly as possible. “No one wants to see strike action in our schools.” Speaking on BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland programme earlier, Ms Somerville described the union pay demands as “simply unaffordable”. After talks ended in failure, members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), NASUWT, Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association (SSTA) and the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS) are taking strike action. It follows SSTA and NASUWT members taking two days of action in December while EIS members walked out on November 24. Asked whether she expected a new offer to be on the table before the end of the week, Ms Somerville said: “We’ll continue discussions with the unions. “I think the challenge that we have is we remain some distance apart on what the Scottish Government and local government can afford and can put on the table from the union demand which is, of course, a 10% increase in pay. “If that had been accepted, if the 5% had been accepted, you would’ve actually seen teachers have a 21.8% cumulative rise since 2018. “So we’re trying very hard to have a fair and affordable package on the table but we do remain unfortunately some distance apart.” She added: “The pay demands we’re having from our trade union colleagues are simply unaffordable for the Scottish Government working on a fixed budget, already allocated, also eroded by inflation and that does make it a very difficult and challenging process to come to a conclusion and resolution on.” Earlier in the programme, Mike Corbett, NASUWT Scotland national official, echoed the concerns that unions and Government were still far away from agreement on pay.

Gareth Davies, the auditor and comptroller general at the NAO, said keeping on top of conflicts of interest was a “crucial part of public stewardship” that was not always followed during the VIP fast lane process. He said the government had given detailed responses on how it would improve its processes after reports from the NAO and others highlighting a failure to adhere to basic standards of procurement when awarding some contracts during the pandemic. But the auditor general said the NAO was watching closely to make sure its recommendations on procurement and pandemic preparedness “do not get lost” as the government deals with other crises such as Ukraine and high energy prices. “We are always careful to recognise the exceptional circumstances but despite the intense pressure it is always necessary to cover basic areas of transparency,” Davies said. “Publishing what you’ve done within the normal timescales is still possible even in an emergency and the whole process around conflicts of interest. “You may well need a speeded up system for referring plausible suppliers of PPE into the system but you should absolutely insist that people should declare it if they have a private interest in that supplier, particularly if they are holding a position of authority or responsibility like a peer or an MP or a senior civil servant. That just couldn’t be demonstrated. “There were clearly people attempting to do that at different stages but there wasn’t a clear trail of how that had been handled. The reason was the sheer pressure of the emergency but you can see now where that leads you if you are not careful.” His comments come after the scandal over Mone, on a leave of absence as a Conservative peer, who is the subject of an inquiry over her alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro during the pandemic. She has vowed to clear her name. Davies gave his assessment after the NAO carried out 36 detailed reports on the £300bn of government’s spending during the Covid pandemic. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the NAO was looking carefully at resilience to help the UK become better financially prepared for events that may require big public spending, guarding against the “collective failure of imagination” to prepare adequately for a major pandemic. He said there would be better “stress testing” of emergency responses, and the NAO would look at preparedness across the board, asking: “How do you avoid being caught out by this?” “You could argue it has happened on more than just Covid. What’s happening on energy is pretty unprecedented and needs another emergency scheme developed at high speed from scratch. We don’t want to have to do that every time,” he said. Davies also warned about the effects of inflation on public sector budgets, especially major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and roads, as well as highlighting the risks that the NHS will not meet its targets on eliminating waits of longer than a year by 2025. Davies said the NAO has been pointing out the “headwinds that the NHS is facing in implementing the planned approach” to waiting lists as well as highlighting the “numbers that the plan was based on assumed the best case scenario … not a severe winter in cases of flu and … [without] the industrial action that is currently under way”. He said the NAO’s report from November highlighted “serious risks” in meeting the 2025 target on eliminating waits of longer than 12 months and its job was now to monitor progress and “help identify barriers to getting through the backlog faster”. “Clearly, a lot of those risks that we identified are still present,” he added. Rishi Sunak recommitted to the NHS waiting list targets last week as one of his major priorities. Davies said inflation was a major risk to the NHS budget as well as departments with exposure to construction costs such as “HS2 and the other rail and road improvement schemes”. Warning that the government has “difficult decisions” ahead on major infrastructure projects, he said it was possible to reduce the scope of some projects or make the case for more money but on others said: “You either do it or you don’t: you have a have binary choice there. So there are some very difficult decisions for government.” Davies said HS2 was a “good example where the legs that have currently been committed to are going to cost more than when the most recent decision to recommit to the schemes was taken, so that’s going to have to be taken into account in one way or another, either through additional funding or through looking at the future scope of the scheme”.","MPs and peers should declare links to firms they back for contracts, says NAO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/mps-and-peers-should-declare-links-to-firms-they-back-for-contracts-says-nao

With the economy set to enter recession, the nation’s productivity puzzle will be a key challenge for the Prime Minister and businesses to overcome in the year ahead. “Productivity has a huge impact on the economy and people’s standard of living. But growing NHS waiting lists, diminishing access to treatment and surging economic inactivity due to ill-health are all weighing on productivity in the UK. “Businesses that proactively implement effective incentivisation and employee benefits programmes throughout their entire workforce will be best placed to retain staff, drive better performance and grow in a post-Covid landscape.”UK bank NatWest has announced a new package of Cost of Living support measures, including £5.7m of funding for charities and partners.NatWest is giving £1m to the Trussell Trust, the food bank charity, to support the Help through Hardship scheme, plus over £1.6m to the debt advice sector; £900k for Responsible Finance to support provision of accessible credit to people; and a £1m partnership with Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) to provide cost of living support.NatWest is also giving struggling customers more time to repay debts, it says: From early February this year, where customers have missed several payments on an unsecured debt such as a loan or overdraft, the bank will extend the time for them to repay their debt from 18 to 24 months, giving them more time and flexibility.

Régis Schultz, the chief executive of JD, said young shoppers had more cash in their pockets than a year ago thanks to the reopening of retail and hospitality which had provided jobs, while inflation had prompted people to go out and buy instead of waiting for bargains.

Heathrow says this is the highest passenger increase of any airport in Europe, “and possibly worldwide”.But it warns:We are concerned that the recovery of the aviation sector, which is critical to the economy, could be set back by the reintroduction of testing for travellers in the UK and elsewhere in response to increasing COVID levels in China, even though governments acknowledge there is no scientific basis for doing so.UK prime minister Rishi Sunak decided to introduce tests on arrivals from China at the end of December, after other countries including the US and Italy brought in similar measures.But scientists told the Observer that screening people coming from China would make little difference, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the UK was already very high, while airport checks had been shown to be unreliable in pinpointing disease carriers.Sunak’s U-turn on China Covid tests is a political move, say scientistsRead moreIf there is to be a correction in UK house prices, it will be driven by the homeowners whose fixed rate mortgage deals are set to expire over the next 12 months, says Zainab Atiyyah, analyst at Third Bridge.Mortgage and Bank of England interest rates started to increase during 2022 – and at least 1.4 millionUK households face the prospect of interest rate rises when they renew their fixed rate mortgages this year.➡️ https://t.co/HwWjla2Iwl pic.twitter.com/QKvIRIYbOU— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 9, 2023 But the UK’s “massive undersupply of new-build and second-hand houses.” will cushion that effect, Atiyyah points out.“Overall, our experts expect a slowdown in sales to continue in 2023 despite new stamp duty thresholds, as supply continues to dwindle.” “Those on Help to Buy deals will be crossing their fingers and hoping their deals don’t fall apart as new homes are delayed or not completed by the end of the year.

It has helped three thousand customers deal with burst pipes, water tanks and other related damage.Direct Line says:This, together with the freeze event from January 2022 and subsidence related claims over the summer means that we currently expect total weather claims to be in the region of £140 million for 2022, well above our 2022 expectation of £73 million.Direct Line’s motor insurance division also saw an increase in third party claims inflation during the fourth quarter of last year, and more claims in the quarter --partly due to adverse weather conditions.Shares in Direct Line have tumbled 28%, to 166p.JD Sports has also predicted its profits will be towards the top end of expectations, following a jump in sales over Christmas.JD Sports’ revenues grew by over 10% in the 22 weeks to 31 December 2022, accelerating to more than 20% in the six-weeks to 31 December 2022.It now expects pre-tax profits for the year to 28 January to be “towards the top end” of market expectations (£933m to £985m), although the final performance depends how the post-Christmas sales go.Shares in JD Sports have jumped 4.6% in early trading, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.Record sales of Champagne and prosecco have helped to push profits at Sainsbury’s to the upper end of forecasts.The supermarket chain has reported that profits this year are expected to be towards the upper end of its guidance range of £630m to £690m, although still below last year’s profits of £730m.J Sainsbury’s retail sales, excluding fuel, rose by 5.2% year-on-year in its third quarter (to 7th January). Grocery sales were 5.6% higher – and 12.5% ahead of pre-pandemic levels.And in the Christmas period, sales rose 7.1%, with grocery sales up 7.1%, general merchandise sales up 7.4% and clothing sales up 5.1%.That included a 22% jump in Taste the Difference Mince Pies, and a 49% rise in Taste the Difference Panettone, while there was “record sales for Champagne and prosecco”.But Simon Roberts, chief executive of J Sainsbury, flags that 2023 will be tough for households.“We understand money will be exceptionally tight this year particularly as many people wait for Christmas bills to land. We are working together with our suppliers to battle cost inflation and we’re keeping prices low again this year with our biggest value campaign yet in January, price matching Aldi on around 300 of our most popular products.",UK FTSE 100 hits highest level since 2018 – business live,https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jan/11/uk-housing-market-slowdown-barratt-sainsburys-christmas-global-risks-wef-business-live

Rishi Sunak had previously refused to say whether he uses private healthcare, insisting it was ""not really relevant"". It followed a press report that Mr Sunak is registered with a private GP practice which charges £250 per consultation. At PMQs, Mr Sunak praised his local hospital ""for the fantastic care they have given my family"". ""That's why I'm passionately committed to protecting it with more funding, more doctors and nurses, and a clear plan to cut the waiting lists,"" he added. Mr Sunak had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that his healthcare was ""a personal choice"". ""As a general policy I wouldn't ever talk about me or my family's healthcare situation … it's not really relevant,"" he told the programme. Registering with an NHS GP does not exclude someone from using private healthcare. The prime minister's spokeswoman said Mr Sunak did not currently have private cover but declined to say when he registered with the NHS. ""In principle, he believes that the personal health details of individuals should remain private, but given the level of interest and in the interests of transparency he has set out that he is registered with a NHS GP,"" she said. A newspaper report in November suggested Mr Sunak was registered with a private GP practice that offers on-the-day appointments and home visits. Latest NHS figures show that in November last year, 58% of NHS patients were not seen on the day they made an appointment. At the same time, a record high of more than seven million people are waiting for hospital treatment. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in response to Mr Sunak's comments that the prime minister ""will find out what it's like to wait on hold at 08:00 as you call for an appointment"". Sir Keir's spokesman confirmed the Labour leader had never used private healthcare. He said he was ""not going to comment on individual health choices"" and Labour was focused on ""ensuring we have the best possible NHS"" for everyone in the country. Sir Keir also clashed with Mr Sunak over the government's plan for new legislation to enforce minimum service levels in the NHS and other key sectors. The Tories had gone ""from clapping nurses to sacking nurses"", Sir Keir said, adding that nurses and ambulance workers would not be on strike if the prime minister had negotiated. The prime minister said Sir Keir would not agree to minimum service levels in the NHS ""because he's on the side of his union paymasters, not patients"". Mr Sunak added that he wanted ""to have constructive dialogue with the unions"" and had accepted the recommendations of independent pay review bodies. Earlier, health unions announced they are pulling out of the NHS Pay Review Body process to determine pay for next year. The 14 unions - representing more than one million ambulance staff, nurses and other NHS workers in England - have called for direct negotiations with ministers about pay. Mr Sunak's comments followed Health Secretary Steve Barclay confirming he used an NHS doctor. Pressed on whether he has NHS care during an interview on LBC, Mr Barclay replied: ""Yes, I don't subscribe to private provision. ""But I don't have a problem with people, with their own money, who wish to spend that money on private healthcare. ""I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing for people to want to do."" Some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have made a point of drawing attention to their use of the NHS when they were prime minister. David Cameron often spoke about how the NHS cared for his disabled son, while Boris Johnson said the health service saved his life after he fell seriously ill with Covid. But when Mrs Thatcher was prime minister she was candid about her use of private health insurance, which she said was vital for her to ""go into hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want"".",PMQs: Rishi Sunak says he is registered with NHS doctor,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64237830?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Mr Kerr slammed the SNP for treating experienced workers as being easily replaceable after the report stated “the age profile of oil and gas workers means a significant proportion are expected to retire” during the First Minister’s acceleration of closing the industry. The energy strategy added it is positive that fewer young people were entering the sector, stating 12 per cent of the oil and gas workforce is under 30. This is despite warnings from the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board that more workers are required to meet future levels of labour demand. But the SNP’s aim of closing down the sector is at odds with what their Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, believes after he said last year that investment in North Sea oil and gas was vital for jobs in Aberdeen. Mr Kerr, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for net zero, energy and transport, said: “The SNP is threatening to destroy the lives of oil and gas workers with its uninformed intention of closing down the sector at its earliest point. “The assertion that the majority of these workers will be retiring is utterly reckless and a slap in the face to those who have dedicated years of service to such a valuable industry to our north-east economy. “This report implies it is a good thing fewer young people are entering the sector when all the evidence points to the very opposite as more people are needed to cope with labour demand. “The negative narrative of this is putting our younger generation off from having a long, productive career in an industry which supports countries worldwide. “Oil and gas is essential to securing our energy supply while also protecting tens of thousands of Scottish jobs. Yet this SNP energy strategy completely undermines the sector which will result in us relying on more expensive imports which do more damage to the environment. “This last week, many north-east residents watched in horror as a baleful, unnatural force threatened to hamper the livelihoods of North Sea workers. “After Nicola Sturgeon’s bid to toss more than 70,000 oil and gas jobs in the skip and wreck the energy transition, they should probably give it another week before trying to watch The Rig as well.” Do you want to respond to this article?

This is as true of climate chaos as anything else. We are hemmed in by stories that prevent us from seeing, or believing in, or acting on the possibilities for change. Some are habits of mind, some are industry propaganda. Sometimes, the situation has changed but the stories haven’t, and people follow the old versions, like outdated maps, into dead ends. We need to leave the age of fossil fuel behind, swiftly and decisively. But what drives our machines won’t change until we change what drives our ideas. The visionary organiser adrienne maree brown wrote not long ago that there is an element of science fiction in climate action: “We are shaping the future we long for and have not yet experienced. I believe that we are in an imagination battle.” In order to do what the climate crisis demands of us, we have to find stories of a livable future, stories of popular power, stories that motivate people to do what it takes to make the world we need. Perhaps we also need to become better critics and listeners, more careful about what we take in and who’s telling it, and what we believe and repeat, because stories can give power – or they can take it away. To change our relationship to the physical world – to end an era of profligate consumption by the few that has consequences for the many – means changing how we think about pretty much everything: wealth, power, joy, time, space, nature, value, what constitutes a good life, what matters, how change itself happens. As the climate journalist Mary Heglar writes, we are not short on innovation. “We’ve got loads of ideas for solar panels and microgrids. While we have all of these pieces, we don’t have a picture of how they come together to build a new world. For too long, the climate fight has been limited to scientists and policy experts. While we need their skills, we also need so much more. When I survey the field, it’s clear that what we desperately need is more artists.” What the climate crisis is, what we can do about it, and what kind of a world we can have is all about what stories we tell and whose stories are heard. Climate change was a story that fell on mostly indifferent ears when it was first discussed in the mainstream more than 30 years ago. Even a dozen years ago, it was supposed to be happening very slowly and in the distant future. There were a lot of references to “our grandchildren’s time”. It was a problem that was difficult to grasp – this dispersed, incremental, atmospheric, invisible, global problem with many causes and manifestations, whose solutions are also dispersed and manifold. That voices from the climate movement have finally succeeded in making the vast majority understand it, and many care passionately about it, might be the biggest single victory the movement will have. Because once you’ve won the popular imagination, you’ve changed the game and its possible outcomes. But this was a long, slow, arduous process, and misconceptions still abound. A lot of people don’t know that we’ve largely won the battle to make people aware and concerned. The LA Times ran a well-intentioned editorial last year about how most Americans don’t care about climate breakdown. That was true once, but no longer is. A Pew Research poll in 2020 concluded that two-thirds of Americans wanted to see more government action on climate, but last summer the scientific journal Nature published a study concluding that most Americans believe that only a minority (37-43%) support climate action, when in reality a large majority (66-80%) does. That gap between perceived and actual support undermines motivation and confidence. We need better stories – and sometimes better means more up to date. Outright climate denial – the old story that climate change isn’t real – has been rendered largely obsolete (outside social media) by climate-driven catastrophes around the globe and good work by climate activists and journalists. But other stories still stop us from seeing clearly. Greenwashing – the schemes created by fossil fuel corporations and others to portray themselves as on the environment’s side while they continue their profitable destruction – is rampant. It’s harder to recognise a false friend than an honest enemy, and their false solutions, delaying tactics and empty promises can be confusing for non-experts. Fortunately, as the climate movement has diversified, one new organisation, Clean Creatives, focuses specifically on pressuring advertising and PR agencies to stop doing the industry’s dirty work. Likewise, climate journalists are exposing how fossil fuel money is funding pseudo-environmental opposition to offshore wind turbines. (As the climate activist and oil policy analyst Antonia Juhasz recently told me, the climate movement is now going after every aspect of the fossil fuel industry, including funding by banks and, via the divestment movement, shares held by investors; donations to politicians; insurers; permits for extraction; transport; refinement; emissions, notably through lawsuits concerning their impact; shutting coal-fired power plants; and pushing for a rapid transition to electrification.) But we still lack stories that give context. For example, I see people excoriate the mining, principally for lithium and cobalt, that will be an inevitable part of building renewables – turbines, batteries, solar panels, electric machinery – apparently oblivious to the far vaster scale and impact of fossil fuel mining. If you’re concerned about mining on indigenous land, about local impacts or labour conditions, I give you the biggest mining operations ever undertaken: for oil, gas, and coal, and the hungry machines that must constantly consume them. Extracting material that will be burned up creates the incessant cycle of consumption on which the fossil fuel industry has grown fabulously rich. It creates climate chaos as well as destruction and contamination at every stage of the process. Globally, burning fossil fuels kills almost 9 million people annually, a death toll larger than any recent war. But that death toll is largely invisible for lack of compelling stories about it. All mining needs to be done with respect for the land and people in the vicinity, but the impact of mining for renewables needs to be weighed against the far more devastating impact of mining for and burning fossil fuel. The race is on to find battery materials that are more commonly available and less impactful than lithium and cobalt, and some of the results look promising. Last summer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced an aluminium-sulphur battery is in the works, while a US company is developing one that stores electricity using iron – the so-called “iron-air” battery. Efforts to extract battery materials from longterm coal waste in West Virginia are among the many others under way. And the Inflation Reduction Act includes funding to research better battery materials and domestic US sources. Other stories of premature defeat are all too common. In the 400,000-strong 2014 climate march in New York City, one section marched behind a huge banner declaring “WE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS” – but many people still believe we do not. We have the solutions we need in solar and wind; we just need to build them out and make the transition, fast. Looking to wildly ineffectual carbon sequestration and other undeveloped technologies as a relevant solution is like ignoring the lifeboats at hand in the hope that fancy new ones are coming when the ship is sinking and speed is of the essence. One story I frequently encounter frames the possibilities in absolutes: if we can’t win everything, then we lose everything. There are so many doom-soaked stories out there – about how civilisation, humanity, even life itself, are scheduled to die out. This apocalyptic thinking is due to another narrative failure: the inability to imagine a world different than the one we currently inhabit. People without much sense of history imagine the world as static. They assume that if the present order is failing, the system is collapsing, and there is no alternative. A historical imagination equips you to understand that change is ceaseless. You only have to look to the past to see such a world, dramatically different half a century ago, stunningly so a century ago. The UK, for example, ran almost entirely on coal power until the 1960s, and if you had said then that it would have to quit coal, many would have imagined this meant an utter collapse of the energy system, not its transformation. Even in 2008, the organisation Carbon Brief noted, “four-fifths of the UK’s electricity came from fossil fuels. Since then, the UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy. Coal-fired power has virtually disappeared and even gas use is down by a quarter. Instead, the country now gets more than half of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear.” Scotland already generates nearly all the electricity it needs from renewables. While I often hear people casually assert that our world is doomed, no reputable scientist makes such claims. Most are deeply worried, but far from hopeless. There are already profound losses, but our action or inaction determine how much more loss will occur, and whose it will be, and some repair is possible. Efforts sufficient to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lower temperatures and reverse some aspects of climate breakdown. Even the journalist David Wallace-Wells, who rose to fame with a deeply pessimistic book about climate a few years ago, has shifted his view. He currently describes a future somewhere between the best and worst case scenarios, a future “with the most terrifying predictions made improbable by decarbonisation and the most hopeful ones practically foreclosed by tragic delay. The window of possible climate futures is narrowing, and as a result, we are getting a clearer sense of what’s to come: a new world, full of disruption … yet mercifully short of true climate apocalypse.” A climate story we urgently need is one that exposes who is actually responsible for climate chaos. It’s been popular to say that we are all responsible, but Oxfam reports that over the past 25 years, the carbon impact of the top 1% of the wealthiest human beings was twice that of the bottom 50%, so responsibility for the impact and the capacity to make change is currently distributed very unevenly. By saying “we are all responsible”, we avoid the fact that the global majority of us don’t need to change much, but a minority needs to change a lot. This is also a reminder that the idea that we need to renounce our luxuries and live more simply doesn’t really apply to the majority of human beings outside what we could perhaps call the overdeveloped world. What is true of Beverly Hills is not true of the majority from Bangladesh to Bolivia. When it comes to who’s harming the climate, it’s also been popular to focus on individual contributions. The fossil fuel industry likes the narrative of personal responsibility as a way to keep us scrutinising ourselves and one another, rather than them. They’ve promoted the concept of climate footprints as a way to keep the focus on us and not them, and it’s worked. Usually if I ask people what they’re doing about the climate emergency, most will talk about what they’re not consuming or doing – but these will never add up to the speed and scale of change needed to change the system. One of the goals of system change is to supersede individual virtue. Just as you no longer have to opt in to buying a car with seatbelts or ask for the no-smoking section on the train or restaurant, at some point in the near future you won’t have to opt into travelling in an electric car or bus, or living or working in all-electric buildings. Electrification will have happened because of the collective action that takes shape as policy and regulation. Last year, the veteran environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a brilliant analysis pointing out that if you have money in one of the banks funding fossil fuels – especially, in the US, Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, and Bank of America – your retirement funds or savings account may have a much larger climate footprint than you do. The impact of your diet and how you get to work may pale in comparison to the impact of your money in the bank. The vegan on the bicycle may still be contributing to climate chaos if her life savings are in a bank lending her money to the fossil fuel industry. Individual impact, leaving the ultra-wealthy aside, matters mostly in the aggregate. And in aggregate we can change that. On 21 March, McKibben, via his new climate group Third Act (on whose advisory board I sit), and dozens of other climate groups will be organising actions by people with money in, or credit cards from, the key US banks, to try to force those institutions to stop funding fossil fuels. Our greatest power lies in our roles as citizens, not consumers, when we can band together to collectively change how our world works. Various campaigns around the world have focused on fossil finance, with significant successes behind them, and much more to achieve ahead. The climate movement has become far more sophisticated and precise in its targets in recent years. It’s doing a brilliant job; it just needs enough people and resources behind it to be more powerful than the status quo. Last year, I took three activists who were formerly part of the Sunrise Movement, a youth group campaigning to address climate breakdown, to see the 1991 film Terminator 2 at a cinema. The film was as great as I remembered, not least because the lead character, Linda Hamilton playing a ferocious young mother, chooses as her motto “no fate but what we make”. In that movie, the future has come back to meddle with the present through the sci-fi technologies of time travel and robot-warrior terminators. We see how actions in the present shape the future through tremendous battles over what that future will be. This is, of course, just as true in real life. We don’t get terminators and other time-travellers to tell us what the consequences of our actions are, but they still have consequences. You ban the insecticide DDT, and a lot of bird species stop dying out. You ban chlorofluorocarbons, and the hole in the ozone layer stops growing. In another way, Terminator 2 is less useful as a lens for thinking about the climate crisis. It’s part of the conventions of storytelling in film – and comics, fiction, graphic novels and too many news narratives – that tells us that the world can only be saved by exceptional individuals, often loners, whose gifts are often the capacity to inflict and endure extreme violence. Linda Hamilton and co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot, clobber, crush, outrun and outfight everything thrown at them, and that’s their celebrated skillset, along with a bit of dry humour. Humour aside, this has little to do with how the world really gets changed most of the time. The skills of real-world superheroes are solidarity, strategy, patience, persistence, vision and the ability to inspire hope in others. The rescuers we need are mostly not individuals, they are collectives – movements, coalitions, campaigns, civil society. Within those groups there may be someone with an exceptional gift for motivating others, but even the world’s greatest conductor needs an orchestra. One person cannot do much; a movement can topple a regime. We are sadly lacking stories in which collective actions or the patient determination of organisers is what changes the world. Another thing we get from our films and fictions is the expectation of a single solution and a clear resolution to our problems: a sudden victory, a celebration, and the trouble is over. The climate crisis does not fit easily into this format. Ceasing to extract and burn fossil fuel is central, but there is no single solution. Protecting carbon-sequestering peat bogs, forests and grasslands also matters; so does transforming high-impact materials such as cement; implementing better design for buildings, transport and cities, and addressing soil conservation, farming and food production and consumption. There are milestones and important goals, but the familiar Hollywood ending – crossing the finish line to wrap up the story – doesn’t describe this reality. Change often functions more like a relay race, with new protagonists picking up where the last left off. In 2019, a Berkeley city councilwoman decided to propose banning fossil-gas connections in new construction, and it was passed by the council unanimously. This small city’s commitment to all-electric new buildings could seem insignificant, but more than 50 other California municipalities picked it up, as did the city of New York. The state of New York failed to pass a similar measure, but Washington state succeeded, and the idea that new construction should not include gas has spread internationally. Such relay races have long been how human rights campaigns work: a good protest, campaign, or even piece of legislation can introduce new ideas that do their own work in the world at large. Even failed campaigns may succeed in opening the path for later change. The Green New Deal did not pass in the US Senate, but it became a template for the Biden administration’s climate legislation, and shifted the conversation about what is possible. It led the way to the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate bill the US has ever passed. Opponents of environmental action often say it is killing jobs; the Green New Deal did a lot to change that story by portraying climate action as a job creator. Recognising the reality of climate breakdown means recognising the interconnectedness of all things. That connection brings obligation: to respect nature, to build domestic regulation and international treaties that protect what’s needed, to limit the freedom of the individual in the name of the wellbeing of the collective. This is, of course, a worldview in direct contrast with free-market fundamentalism and libertarianism. Even the facts of climate science are ideologically offensive to people committed to individual freedom without accountability, let alone the demands created by treaties and regulations. Responsibility and obligation are dismal words in mainstream culture, so perhaps there will be other stories that recognise this process as reciprocity and relationship, in which we give back, in gratitude and respect for all the Earth does for us. Even short of that, we can recognise our self-interest in maintaining the system on which life depends. If news is the daily report on what’s just happened, we need a way of pulling back from individual events, to see the broad context of how it happened. If you only tell short-term stories, it all becomes kind of meaningless. Martin Luther King Jr said: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” We’ve seen it bend a lot of ways in recent years, toward and away from justice, but it takes time just to see it bend at all. You need benchmarks or memories of how things used to be even to see change of any kind, including climate change. The South Pacific climate activist and poet Julian Aguon recently declared that Indigenous peoples “have a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory, and just might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect – for the Earth and for each other”. That emphasis on collective memory suggests that a strong sense of the past allows for a strong sense of the future, that remembering difficulty and transformation equips us to face them again. One of the things that buoys me up is the long arc of change in renewable technology. Mostly what you see in the news about renewables is short-term: stories on the latest drop in price, or proliferation of solar and wind over the past year or two. If you enlarge your time frame, you see that those annual changes have amounted to an astonishing plummet in prices and rise in efficiency and global use, compounded by innovations in materials and storage. Twenty years ago we did not have constructive ways to leave the age of fossil fuel behind. Now we do. And the solutions keep getting better. In 2021, the organisation Carbon Tracker put out a report that showed current technology could produce 100 times as much electricity from solar and wind than current global demand. The report concludes: “The technical and economic barriers have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political.” At the end of the last millennium, those barriers seemed insurmountable. The change is revolutionary, but the revolution was too slow to be visible to most. The report continues: “At the current 15-20% growth rates of solar and wind, fossil fuels will be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050. The unlocking of energy reserves 100 times our current demand creates new possibilities for cheaper energy and more local jobs in a more equitable world, with far less environmental stress.” We tend to think utopias are unbelievable, but this is a sober-minded thinktank focused on climate and energy politics. The report made little impact on the general public. Because the energy revolution has been incremental, there’s been no single breakthrough moment. Yet it adds up to an encouraging, and even astonishing narrative. On the other hand, people find grim narratives all too believable, whether or not they are grounded in fact. We are still inundated by harmful, as well as untrue, stories about climate and the future. Prophecies can be self-fulfilling: if you insist that we cannot possibly win, you pit yourself against the possibility of victory and the people trying to achieve it. There’s yet another narrative that’s persisted at least since the invention of compact fluorescent lightbulbs and the Toyota Prius: that we must renounce abundance and enter an age of austerity. It’s all in the telling. To consider our age an age of abundance, you have to be counting sheer accumulated stuff and ignoring how it is distributed. That is, we live in an age of extreme wealth for some, and desperation for the many. But there’s another way to count wealth and abundance – as hope for the future, safety and public confidence, emotional wellbeing, love and friendship and strong social networks, meaningful work and purposeful lives, equality and justice and inclusion. Early on, we heard that renewables were very expensive – this was part of the austerity narrative, or an excuse for not making the transition. But improvements in design and economies of scale are among the factors making them the cheapest form of electricity almost everywhere on earth. There’s no reason to think the innovations of design and economic improvements are all behind us; I suspect they’re mostly ahead of us. Engineer and energy expert Saul Griffith recently wrote: “Most people believe a clean-energy future will require everyone to make do with less, but it actually means we can have better things.” The old story was that we couldn’t afford to do what the climate emergency required. The new one is that it would not only be ecologically devastating, but more expensive not to. Renewables are on the way to being cheaper than fossil fuel; in many places, they already are. Texas and Iowa get a huge amount of their electricity from wind because it makes economic sense, not because these red states are passionate about addressing the climate crisis. Over their lifetime, electric cars work out to be cheaper than internal combustion cars because charging and maintaining them is cheaper. And of course these two examples don’t include the indirect effects of burning fossil fuels on human health and the climate. A lot of people tend to measure climate action in terms of huge national or international news events, but the change that matters is often happening at local and regional and other levels. A university divests; a state sets a date for ending the sale of new petrol cars; a city passes a measure mandating all-electric new buildings; ground is broken on a major solar installation; a state or country sets a new record for percentage of wind power in its energy mix; a pipeline or gas terminal or drilling site gets cancelled; a carbon-sequestering forest or peat bog gets protected status; a coal plant closes. This does not erase all the bad news, about continuing breakdown of natural systems and its toll on human lives and impact on a livable future, but it does contextualise them as crises we can respond to if we choose to. So much is happening, both wonderful and terrible, and it adds up to more stories than almost anyone can take in. But the overarching frameworks in which we receive them matter, and so do the critical skills to recognise, choose, and change stories. The climate crisis is a problem with no single solution, but many, just as there is no one saviour, but many protagonists in the struggle. In 2019, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said we must embrace “cathedral thinking”, adding: “We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.” The speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler included this passage in one of her essays: “OK,” the young man challenged. “So what’s the answer?” “There isn’t one,” I told him. “No answer? You mean we’re just doomed?” He smiled as though he thought this might be a joke. “No,” I said. “I mean there’s no single answer that will solve all of our future problems. There’s no magic bullet. Instead there are thousands of answers – at least. You can be one of them if you choose to be.” This is an edited version of a speech given at Princeton University in November 2022","‘If you win the popular imagination, you change the game’: why we need new stories on climate",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/12/rebecca-solnit-climate-crisis-popular-imagination-why-we-need-new-stories

If its construction goes to plan, a €2.5 billion (£2.18 billion) undersea pipeline will convey “green hydrogen” from Spain to France from 2030. In the US, some power stations are being upgraded to allow hydrogen to be blended with fossil gas, and the Norwegian oil company Equinor is teaming up with Thermal SSE to build a 1,800 megawatt (MW) “blue hydrogen” power plant in Britain. Meanwhile, China unveiled a plan in March which includes deploying 50,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2025 and early December saw the first hydrogen-fuelled tractors and forklifts leave the assembly line at a new plant in Guangdong province. Hydrogen is produced in multiple ways. A colour spectrum is used to render it simple. “Grey” and “brown/black” hydrogen come from fossil gas (methane) and coal (brown or black coal) respectively – a process that, for every tonne of hydrogen, emits between ten and 12 tonnes of CO₂ for grey hydrogen and 18 to 20 for brown. “Blue” is the same process except the carbon dioxide is supposed to be captured and stored underground. And “green” hydrogen is conventionally defined as generated from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. But only 0.04% of hydrogen is green, and blue hydrogen is less than 1%. The rest is grey or brown, most of which is used in oil refineries and for manufacturing ammonia and methanol. It’s an enormous industry which emits more CO₂ than all of Britain and France combined. It is widely hoped that a silver lining of today’s high gas prices will be green hydrogen becoming a cost-competitive alternative to dirty fuels in boilers, shipping tankers and steelworks furnaces. Unfortunately, without electricity market reform, this opportunity is likely to be squandered. And while the buzz around the hydrogen economy intensifies, a closer look suggests the fuel is less a spearhead for a green transition and more the subject of an elaborate bait-and-switch operation by oil companies. Hydrogen’s true colours Green hydrogen is essential for decarbonisation: to replace fossil fuels in steelmaking, ammonia production for fertilisers and possibly shipping and trucking – processes which are difficult to electrify. Some green hydrogen is crosshatched with dirtier hues. So it’s not simply that in its production a lot of energy is wasted in the double transformation from electricity to gas and then fuel. But burning hydrogen also emits nitrogen oxides, air pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain. If green hydrogen production is scaled up to play a significant economic role by 2050, its freshwater demand will exceed one-quarter of today’s global annual consumption, risking water scarcity in some regions. Above all, hydrogen is meaningfully green only if the renewable energy that generates it cannot be fed into the grid to replace power from gas or coal plants. Blue hydrogen relies on a similar – but much more harmful – trick of the light. For hydrogen to be true blue, the emissions must be captured and securely stored. In theory, carbon capture and storage works but nearly all plants use the captured carbon to pump more oil and many have been shut down as failures. Only a handful store carbon indefinitely and even these consume lots of energy and capture only some of the CO₂, which can leak. Blue hydrogen’s main source is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is notorious for escaping drilling wells and pipelines. Research suggests that these issues make blue hydrogen worse for the climate than fossil gas. In the EU, as in many economies, electricity pricing is based on the principle of marginal costs, which means that the most expensive source (typically fossil gas) sets the wholesale power price. During sunny or windy spells, a glut of renewable energy generation can slash electricity prices, freeing them from the grip of natural gas prices for a few hours at a time. This is often not enough to justify investments in the electrolysers which produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen won’t gain the necessary price advantage over blue hydrogen and fossil gas until electricity markets are restructured. Meanwhile, the high price of oil and gas has turbocharged the industry’s expansion. The US government is exhorting oil and fracking firms to “drill baby drill”. Britain’s government is to award more than 100 licenses to drill for oil and gas and colossal new fossil fuel investments have been announced across the Middle East and Africa. In a few years when these new sources come onstream, and particularly if economic growth continues to slow and depress energy demand, gas and oil will become cheaper again – until the next price spike prompts new rounds of investment, and the infernal cycle continues. The owners of newly-built wells, pipelines and terminals will fight to defend those assets and stall decarbonisation. Now fossil-fuel firms are rebranding themselves as agents of “carbon management.” The aim is to prevent their assets from getting stranded by repurposing them, presenting a largely fictional substance, blue hydrogen, as a low-carbon “bridge” to an unspecified green future. Other sectors have joined the oil-led coalition. As the engineer Tom Baxter observes, gas network operators and boiler manufacturers see their survival in this ploy. Utilities are similarly keen, as hydrogen’s inefficiencies allow them to sell more power. Tackling this stalling operation requires public policy. Governments will need to regulate or tax carbon out of the market while simultaneously ramping up renewables. The approach to electricity pricing also needs to shift, to decouple the prices of electricity generated from renewables and fossil gas. The marginal pricing system hugely benefits renewable project owners, since they profit from high electricity prices and effectively zero input costs. An alternative market structure would set rewards for generators according to their average costs plus a slight surplus which could be reinvested into deploying more renewables and other green technologies, providing consumers with cheap electricity. This can only be achieved through a robustly regulated market or by nationalising energy companies and setting prices and production. These interventions would give green hydrogen a competitive advantage over blue or grey variants, one that could be furthered with other subsidies, such as tax credits on the model of the US Inflation Reduction Act. Above all, energy demand must be reduced to ease upward pressure on price. In any future energy system, hydrogen will have a role. But its expansion must be carefully designed, to prevent the promise of green hydrogen disguising the risks of its blue and grey cousins.

The company, which is part of Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, will begin consultations over 440 redundancies and said it will idle its plant at West Bromwich and convert another in Newport, Wales, into a storage facility. Jobs are also likely to be lost at its Rotherham plant after Liberty said it became “unviable” to produce cheaper steel products, “due to high energy costs and imports from countries without the same environmental standards”. The firm will now focus on steel for defence, energy and aircraft-making clients in a bid to regain profitability. Jeffrey Kabel, Chief Transformation Officer for Liberty Steel Group said: “While our action is expected to regrettably impact the roles of some of our workforce we will provide a level of guaranteed salary and placement opportunities.” He added: “We remain committed to our longer-term growth plans in the UK including our plan to grow Rotherham into a 2 million tonne green steel hub.” Cheap imports from China, where European producers say lax pollution regulations make the material cheaper to make, are squeezing margins on cheaper steel products such as the thick rebar staves used to reinforce concrete in the construction industry. But Britain is also at a disadvantage to European producers, according to UK Steel, the industry group. It estimates that German producers will pay £107 per megawatt hour of electricity in the coming financial year compared to £174 for UK steel mills. Electric furnaces are seen as the future of many UK steel mills as wind power becomes an increasing part of power supply. The steel sector employs 34,500 people directly in the UK and supports a further 43,000 in supply chains. The jobs are often in areas with few other skilled careers and they offer a salary averaging £37,629, 45pc higher than the UK national average. Alun Davies, Community steelworkers' union national officer, said: “This announcement is a body blow to Liberty Steel’s loyal UK workforce, who couldn’t have done more to get the company through an exceptionally challenging period.” Liberty Steel, the UK’s third-largest steel maker after Tata and British Steel, employs 1,900 people in the UK as well as 5,000 contractors. It said Rotherham could lose 185 jobs, while 121 were at risk in Newport, where the company makes thin plates of steel known as hot rolled coil. West Bromwich could lose 99 jobs, and 35 could be lost in Tredegar in South Wales. Both sites make steel tubes. Liberty was hit by the collapse of Greensill Capital from which it borrowed $5bn (£4.1bn). Mr Gupta’s businesses had borrowed from ventures founded by Australian entrepreneur Lex Greensill, which loaned money to companies short term. It collapsed after one of its insurers refused to renew cover. In November, Liberty reached an understanding with creditors to Lex Greensill’s former lending empire including Swiss bank Credit Suisse, in what it called a major step in refinancing the troubled businesses.",Liberty Steel to make over 400 staff redundant as energy costs hammer industry,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/12/liberty-steel-make-400-staff-redundant-energy-costs-hammer-industry/

Thursday saw several developments in Britain’s many industrial disputes as it emerged the ambulance union will meet next week to consider six more strike days. Staff at more than 150 universities across the country are demanding that employers push up their offer of a 3 per cent pay rise after more than a decade of below-inflation increases, the union said. “The clock is now ticking for the sector to produce a deal or be hit with widespread disruption throughout spring,” UCU general secretary Jo Grady said. Meanwhile, around 100,000 civil servants have also decided to go ahead with a walkout next month after failed talks with the government were dismissed as a “total farce”. Doctors’ unions told health secretary Steve Barclay that he must address the “workforce crisis” at a meeting on Thursday, during which there was no movement on pay demands, while a ballot of a teacher’s union failed to meet the threshold for strike action. Talks aimed at resolving the long-running rail dispute were also set to continue following meetings between unions and employers on Thursday. Further ambulance strikes loom as figures showed emergency response times had fallen to their worst on record, with more than one in 10 people left waiting for paramedics for more than three-and-a-half hours after calling, including with serious illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of damaging the NHS. Speaking in Belfast, he said: “The most important thing is that these strikes are ended. They will only be ended if the government gets in the room and negotiates and so instead of grandstanding, they need to govern.” Mr Barclay was given a “very clear message” that it would not be enough to focus on next year’s NHS settlement with doctors without a shift on current wages, union leaders said. Representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA), hospital doctors’ union the HCSA, and the British Dental Association (BDA) all met Mr Barclay on Thursday at what was described by both sides as a “constructive” meeting. A strike by 100,000 civil servants will go ahead next month after talks with the government aimed at resolving a bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions broke down. Cabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin met with union leaders to discuss growing industrial unrest after weeks of stoppages across the country, including by Border Force staff over Christmas.

Nasuwt general secretary Patrick Roach said the union remains “in formal disputes with ministers and employers and will be continuing to take forward our campaigning for a Better Deal for Teachers. He said: “The readiness of our members to support industrial action demonstrates the anger of the profession and the need for governments in England and Wales to engage in meaningful negotiations to address the deep concerns of our members. “Our campaign to fight for the real-terms pay awards that teachers and headteachers deserve continues.” Leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) met separately with the Rail Delivery Group on Thursday. Both sides said detailed discussions were held and they were working towards a revised offer. Strikes have been held since last summer in the row over pay, jobs and conditions, causing huge disruption to services. No more strikes have been called. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said: “We have been in detailed discussions with the Rail Delivery Group for the train operating companies. We are working jointly towards a revised offer for their section of the dispute. “We’ve agreed that over the next couple of days we’ll continue to work on that through discussions, and we’ll see what comes of it.” Additional reporting by Press Association.",University staff to walk out for 18 days as ambulance workers consider further strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/strikes-ambulance-trains-nhs-teachers-b2261200.html

The James Hutton Institute has signed construction contracts with McLaughlin & Harvey worth £28.7m for the next stage of the ongoing redevelopment of its Invergowrie estate. This new contract comprises the construction of a combined Advanced Plant Growth Centre (APGC) and international barley hub (IBH). The new building – with the APGC downstairs and the IBH above – will be full of the latest state-of-the-art scientific equipment. This will include computing facilities, imaging technology, sensor-based systems, robotics and controlled environmental cabinets for growing plants. The project, funded by £62m from the Tay Cities Deal, is part of a masterplan to create two institute-led innovation centres at Invergowrie. It will help establish Scotland as a leader in global food security and crop resilience. Enabling works are ongoing on-site. A number of older buildings are being demolished to make way for the new facility. It will be built in the heart of the Invergowrie Campus and is due to be completed in early 2024. A ‘significant milestone’ for £62m project James Hutton Institute chief executive Colin Campbell hailed a “significant milestone” for the project. He added: “It aims to futureproof the barley sector across Scotland and the UK. “This new facility will serve as the key research hub. “It is set to bring around £60 million benefit and over 1,200 jobs to Scotland over the next 10 years.” UK Government Minister for Scotland Malcolm Offord said the facility will support “the future prosperity of our farming industry”. He also welcomed the creation of jobs in the region. Mr Offord said: “The UK Government is investing £45m at the James Hutton Institute through the Tay Cities Deal. “These new facilities will undertake vital research that will support food security and the future prosperity of our farming industry, while also creating new jobs for the region. McLaughlin & Harvey’s operations director Robbie Clark said the firm was delighted to be working on the project. He said: “Having recently completed the state-of-the-art Barley Field Centre facilities, our highly experienced project team will now move seamlessly on to the delivery of the new Advanced Plant Growth Centre and International Barley Hub.” Newly filed accounts for its commercial arm, James Hutton Limited, show it made pre-tax profits of over £600,000 for the year to March 2022. Its turnover for the period was £4.3m, up from £3.4m the year previous.","Next step for Tayside&#8217;s £62m science project that could create 1,200 jobs",https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/business-environment/business/4050538/next-step-for-taysides-62m-science-project-that-could-create-1200-jobs/

At first, there is often outrage that the usual supremacy of bosses over workers has been suspended. Preserving such hierarchies is one of Conservatism’s main aims. But then there is sometimes a sense of opportunity: a belief that the strikers and their supporters may fall into a familiar trap, set by decades of anti-union legislation and press propaganda. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have believed that strikes can be used to make Tory governments look tough, and to discredit Labour and the wider left. The succession of aggressive, deliberately provocative anti-strike measures announced over the last six months by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak all reflect an assumption that taking on the unions is one of the few remaining strategies that might get the Conservatives re-elected. Yet there is also a third, almost forgotten Tory approach to strikes. Before the Thatcher government, her predecessor as Conservative premier, Edward Heath, faced with strikes that, like today’s, were highly disruptive and yet had considerable public support, was sometimes forced to negotiate and make concessions. As the leader of an unpopular government presiding over a fragile economy that the strikes were weakening further, Heath reluctantly accepted that the unions could not all be beaten. The briefly more constructive tone of some of this week’s talks between ministers and union leaders could be a sign that Sunak, too, will ultimately have to concede at least partial victories to some of the strikers. Like Heath, he is not a dominant or charismatic enough prime minister to change the national conversation about strikes and unions, as Thatcher did. His administration could finally mark the beginning of the end for the version of union-bashing Conservatism she invented, which seems increasingly irrelevant to today’s world of poverty wages and modest union memberships. Alternatively, the industrial relations of Sunak’s premiership could be much messier. Like the party he leads – for now, at least – the prime minister’s political thinking is an unstable, quite possibly unsustainable mix, including a desire to be pragmatic and “reasonable”, a dogmatic belief in markets as the best distributors of economic rewards, and an elite remoteness from ordinary working lives. His government’s attitude to the strikes is to be more conciliatory and more confrontational at the same time. Some strikers may be offered one-off bonuses and better pay rises; others, if they refuse to provide so-far-undefined “minimum service” in sectors from health to education may in future be sacked – despite being participants in walkouts that were democratically agreed and wholly legal when launched. For days now, the government has presented this minimum service legislation as an even-handed measure, to “restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption”. But claiming that a better “balance” between trade unionists and the public is required – rather than acknowledging that in millions of cases trade unionists and the public are the same people – has been a partisan Tory ploy for decades. British life has been tilted against unions since the 80s. And the Tories have never shown any interest in balancing the relationship between the public and other, more powerful and disruptive, but right-leaning, economic protagonists, such as the City of London. The disingenuous and vaguely worded minimum service bill also echoes recent draconian legislation aimed partly at road-blocking climate activists, “to balance the rights of protesters against the rights of others to go about their daily business”. Sunak may present himself as a centre-right technocrat, but partly out of panic at the mounting opposition to his government and Conservatism in general, he is increasingly ruling as an authoritarian. The government insists it supports the right to strike. The business secretary, Grant Shapps – often selected to try to make extreme policies sound moderate – said on the BBC’s Today programme earlier this week that the “ideal outcome” of the bill would be for the government “to have the power” to set minimum service levels “and never have to use it”, because unions would voluntarily set their own. But this scenario is less reassuring than it was meant to sound. If strikes in much of the economy are required to come with their own strike-breaking operations, of a size dictated directly or indirectly by the government, something fundamental to workplace politics has been altered. It’s possible that the bill may never become law, since it seems to contravene protections for unions in the European convention on human rights. And even if the legislation survives challenges in the courts, the Commons and the Lords, and on the streets (the TUC has announced a “national right to strike day” on 1 February) it may be hard to implement. Minimum service levels will have to be defined for a vast range of different workplaces, and then enforced without sacking too many essential staff or creating too many union martyrs. Yet to focus on such difficulties, enormous though they are, is to miss part of the point of this latest attack on strikers. Like many Tory policies since and including Brexit, the bill is meant to be symbolic and divisive as much as practical, to create bogeymen and energise Tory supporters. If inflation falls as expected between now and the election, and the strikers’ pay claims therefore seem less justified to many voters, then a continuing anti-union culture war might be timely. Without a Thatcher, fresh rightwing ideas or much remaining administrative energy, today’s Tories probably can’t run a reforming government that really hurts the left – but they can pretend. The problem with this impersonation of radicalism, though, is that it requires enough voters to be taken in. And Johnson’s drifting premiership, Truss’s shambolic tenure and now Sunak’s tone-deaf performance in 10 Downing Street have removed the Conservatives’ credibility as a governing party. Even the union-hating press hasn’t given the minimum service bill as much coverage as you might expect, which suggests uncertainty about its significance. Half a century ago, as well as negotiating with unions, Heath’s government also tried to weaken them through legislation. The 1970 industrial relations bill eventually became law despite huge protests. But it was widely flouted, and he lost the next election. If you’re a struggling Tory prime minister, victories on paper over the workers probably won’t save you.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded an increase of 0.1% as the services sector remained in growth despite the soaring cost of living. Experts at the ONS said the slight rise was supported by the technology sector and a strong showing by pubs and bars amid a boost from the winter World Cup in Qatar. It nevertheless represented a slowdown in growth after GDP increased by 0.5% in October. Analysts had predicted the economy would shrink by 0.3% for November. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy grew a little in November, with increases in telecommunications and computer programming helping to push the economy forward. “Pubs and bars also did well as people went out to watch World Cup games. “This was partially offset by further falls in some manufacturing industries, including the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, as well as falls in transport and postal, partially due to the impact of strikes. “Over the last three months, however, the economy still shrank – mainly due to the impact of the extra bank holiday for the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in September.” Consumer-facing industries were the biggest growth driver of the month, witnessing a 0.4% increase amid a lift from higher food and drink sales during the World Cup. The service sector also grew by 0.2% as more punters visited pubs and other venues, although this still reflected a slowdown from a 0.7% rise a month earlier. In November, the construction sector saw growth fall away as it stayed flat for the month following a 0.4% rise in October. Elsewhere, manufacturing was the main cause of a 0.2% decline in the production sector for the period. The ONS added that GDP still contracted by 0.3% over the three months to November despite the latest growth. The economy also declined by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2022 and would therefore enter a technical recession if a further fall is recorded for the final quarter of the year. Economists have suggested that the latest data makes it less clear whether the UK will have entered a recession at the end of last year. Kitty Usher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “This is stronger activity than was expected for November and so will further contribute to the improvement in market sentiment we have seen in the last few weeks. “Given we know the economy also grew in October – albeit driven by a rebound from the period of state mourning – it is no longer certain that the economy will meet the technical definition of a recession when the final data for 2022 is in.” It comes as inflation started to cool down in November, dropping to 10.7% from a 41-year-high of 11.1% a month earlier, and it is expected to drop further through 2023. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said: “We have a clear plan to halve inflation this year – an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world. “To support families through this tough patch, we will provide an average of £3,500 support for every household over this year and next – but the most important help we can give is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year so we get the economy growing again.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow Chancellor, said: “Today’s results are just another page in the book of failure that is the Tory record on growth. “The news of further economic pain will be deeply concerning to families already struggling with the soaring cost of living.”",UK economy unexpectedly grows in November,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/gdp-jeremy-hunt-rachel-reeves-institute-of-directors-b2261459.html

The UK's gross domestic product (GDP) - a key economic measure of services, construction and manufacturing output - rose by 0.1%. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said pubs and restaurants contributed to growth as people went out to watch World Cup games. However, in the three months to November, the economy shrank by 0.3%. The UK economy had been widely expected to contract in November. But the services sector, which includes a wide-range of industries from hospitality to shopping, was the biggest driver of growth that month. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, told the BBC: ""Business involved in telecoms and computer programmers did okay in November. ""Also interestingly employment agencies did reasonably well and perhaps that reflects those businesses seeking support to fill the vacancies they have which we know from our labour market figures has been an issue in certain sectors.""

They want senior managers at tech firms to face two years in jail if they breach new duties over acceptable content, which includes posts promoting self-harm, depicting sexual violence or facilitating suicide. Labour is expected to support the amendment. Currently the proposed laws would only make bosses criminally liable for failing to give information to media regulator Ofcom and firms would face higher fines. Culture secretary Michelle Donelan has said she is “not ruling out” changes to legislation in the face of the major backbench rebellion. Dame Andrea said in its current form the bill is just asking companies “nicely” to protect children online. She told BBC Radio 4: “There should be this backstop that if you, as a senior tech director, or manager, knowingly allow harm to be caused that results in suicide, pornography, child abuse online and so on. “If you let that happen, there should be a backstop that you can be criminally prosecuted.” Dame Andrea added that in many other businesses, including in the financial and construction sectors, directors will face prosecution if their practices cause significant harm to someone.

The winning bids were revealed in a joint announcement by the UK and Scottish governments. The special economic zones north of the border are being created under a scheme agreed by the two governments. The successful applicants will be able to offer tax incentives and lower tariffs in the zones. A total of five bids for green freeport status were submitted, with North East Scotland, Orkney and Clyde missing out. Each had to set out how they would regenerate their area, create high-quality jobs and support transition to a net-zero economy. The Forth Green Freeport bid was led by Forth Ports, which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland. In submitting its bid, Forth Ports said it had the potential to create up to 50,000 new, high-quality jobs in renewable energy, manufacturing, sustainable fuels and construction. Its activities will focus on renewables, advanced manufacturing, alternative fuels, carbon capture utilisation and storage, shipbuilding, logistics and the creative industries. The Opportunity Cromarty Firth consortium - backed by Port of Cromarty Firth, Global Energy Group, Highland Resources and Port of Inverness - said it could create 25,000 jobs. The Inverness and Cromarty Firth bid aims to build a ""world-beating"" floating offshore wind manufacturing sector, with sites in the Cromarty Firth, Invergordon, Nigg and Inverness. Also called free trade zones, freeports are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in a zone receive tax waivers or tax breaks on National Insurance contributions, Land and Buildings Transactions Tax, business rates and capital allowances. The Scottish ""green freeport"" model includes commitments to meeting net zero targets and supporting fair work practices. The UK government has committed funding of £52m to the project and bidders had to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. Scotland's deputy first minister, John Swinney, described the creation of green freeports as a ""milestone achievement"". He said: ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport and Forth Green Freeport will support businesses to create high-quality, well-paid new jobs, promote growth and regeneration, and make a significant contribution to achieving our net zero ambitions. ""The successful applicants showed a strong determination to embed fair work practices, including payment of the Real Living Wage, and to enshrine net zero initiatives in their work. ""We look forward to working closely with them to ensure they deliver maximum positive impact and become operational as soon as possible."" The UK government's Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the green freeports would ""undoubtedly be transformative for future generations"". He added: ""Scotland has areas of outstanding opportunity but there are also places that can benefit from more investment to truly level up communities that have been overlooked. ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Firth of Forth are fantastic areas for these new green freeports to set up, ensuring the benefits are felt right across Scotland. ""This will help to create exciting new jobs, boost business and encourage investment in the local areas and beyond."" Scottish Renewables said it was pleased that the freeports would have green energy as a focus. Its head of energy transition and supply chain, Emma Harrick, said they would ""help Scotland compete on the international stage as offshore wind develops to become the mainstay of electricity generation in the UK"". The Scottish and UK governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border, after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later said they would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. The SNP's partners in government - the Scottish Greens - do not support the freeports, arguing they are likely to result in ""greenwashing"" rather than genuine action on sustainability. Greens MSP Ross Greer described freeports as a ""Thatcherite gimmick"" and voiced concern about potential abuse by criminals. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""We've consistently across the world seen freeports attract a lot of criminal activity, particularly money laundering and smuggling, because of the customs arrangements that are in place for them, because they are about deregulation, they are about making it 'easier', particularly for international trade."" Paul Swinney, director of policy research for think tank Centre for Cities, said it remained to be seen how much impact the new freeports would have. He said: ""With freeports, the government has dressed it up as saying we are going to make them into centres of innovation and hotbeds of new ideas. ""But the reality is that the tools that are that on offer make these schemes very attractive to low-skilled businesses rather than high-skilled businesses.""",Cromarty Firth and Forth to host first green freeports,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64248082?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

The Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) bid is a collaboration of more than a dozen organisations representing industry, academia and the public sector around the Easter Ross and Inverness area. The aim is to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity in manufacturing, and from local and inward investment, innovation, skills development and employment. READ MORE: Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport officially confirmed by Scottish and UK Governments The OCF area has been highlighted as the main location for the UK to benefit from floating wind manufacturing. Reacting to the news, HIE’s chief executive Stuart Black, said: “We congratulate Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) on their successful bid. This is fantastic news. “Our collective belief in the region and the key ports’ capacity and capability to play an essential role in offshore wind and green hydrogen delivery has been confirmed by the dedication, commitment and resolve shown by the bid partners. ""This paves the way for even greater industry collaboration. The consortium’s physical assets, natural resources, experienced supply chain, and can-do people have proven to be a winning combination that can lead to future success. “The Highlands and Islands will play a critical role in meeting the challenging net zero targets at both Scotland and UK levels. Green freeport status for the Cromarty Firth will be a huge asset, driving collaboration between industry, academia and the public sector to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity, investment, innovation and skills development. “It will attract large-scale manufacturing and create thousands of green jobs that complement the skills of the local workforce and accelerate Scotland’s and the UK’s progress to achieving net zero targets. “A green freeport will also build on recent significant investments made in ports and harbours across the region and the historic and ongoing strengths here in energy, engineering and life sciences. “It will be a key enabler for supply chains of the future, rapidly accelerating domestic manufacturing capacity in an area with a long-standing industrial heritage. “We very much look forward to our region working in partnership with OCF, as we seek to secure maximum socio-economic impact, not just around the Cromarty Firth and Inverness but throughout many parts of the Highlands and Islands.” Sheelagh Cooley, real estate partner in the Edinburgh office of law firm Shoosmiths, also welcomed the successful bid. She said: “The confirmation of two green freeports in Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Forth represents an opportunity to drive forward new development, regeneration and economic growth in Scotland. “The potential impact of these projects, however, must not be limited to the immediate vicinity of the green freeports. Rather, true success hinges on the ability to also revitalise surrounding towns and cities, many of which are economically deprived. “In Inverness and Cromarty Firth, the introduction of a green freeport is said to have the potential to unlock £2.5bn of new private sector investment – creating up to 25,000 jobs. This is alongside developing wind power technology, with its port facilities already supporting offshore wind projects. “While the introduction of green freeports is governed by UK legislation, the model’s legislative structure is subject to devolved and reserved powers. The sites are intended to be secure custom zones where business can be carried out inside a land border, but where different custom and tax rules apply - offering various regulatory and financial incentives. “From a planning perspective, the green freeports are likely to operate under extended permitted development rights. Combined with a streamlining of the consenting process for development, this type of relaxed planning regime could, in theory, allow schemes – residential, commercial and infrastructure - to be brought forward at speed and avoiding certain barriers. “Unlike the UK government’s freeport model, and investment zone proposals, Scottish green freeports are subject to additional requirements, including on carbon neutrality and paying the real Living Wage. “The Forth green freeport could act as a catalyst for the manufacture of offshore wind turbines, shipbuilding and energy systems. It encompasses several ports, industrial and logistics sites, as well as Edinburgh Airport, with the consortium behind the bid outlining that it could lead to a boom in job creation and economic growth that is rooted in renewable energy and decarbonisation. “The successful bidders will now work with the Scottish and UK Government to determine a governance structure for each site. A process that must balance deregulation and economic growth with protecting the environment and assisting the transition to net zero. “Subject to compliance with the regulatory controls, green freeports should provide a welcome opportunity for growth in the Scottish economy, especially in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.” Dr Liz Cameron CBE, Chief Executive, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, also welcomed the award. She said: “It is great news for Scottish business that the UK and Scottish Governments have finally confirmed the sites of the two winning bids. It’s important now that both governments act swiftly to ensure that the successful sites are operational at the earliest opportunity, we are all competing to attract investment and trade. “Whilst it will be very disappointing for those areas who were not successful, we would urge both governments to now consider, in partnership with the business community, other incentives and initiatives which could be developed from the innovation demonstrated by the other bidders.” Professor Chris O’Neil, principal and chief executive of UHI Inverness, said: “The awarding of Green Freeport status to Inverness and Cromarty Firth will have a transformative impact on the economic fortunes of the community we serve. ""We are poised, together with our UHI partners, to meet the subsequent skills and knowledge demand. “We have the expertise in engineering, research, technology, design and construction to provide a highly-skilled and aspirational workforce, including trainees, apprentices, graduates and researchers. “As well as being well-placed to meet the associated need for talent, we also have the established industry links and capacity for knowledge exchange to make valuable collaborative contributions to the creation of a global green hub. “Our talented and committed students have proved their resilience by studying while coping with the consequences of a pandemic and then a cost-of-living crisis, and this announcement is significant in that it represents an improved future and enhanced opportunities for many of them. “Current and upcoming students will complete their learning journey knowing there is the potential for attractive employment on our doorstep in an expanding industry.

Since taking post in October, he has worked assiduously to present a “slick” image to the media, undertaken multiple U-turns to halt backbench rebellions and tried at every turn to position himself positively against Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer. The tricky technocrat in No 10 is obsessed with good press. It is an approach that bares stark contrast to the days of Liz Truss, who showed little concern for how her policies might be received amid her deeply misguided ideological crusade. Unlike his predecessor, therefore, you can take for granted that when Sunak announces a new policy, there will be a hefty amount of calculated politicking involved. In this way, November’s Autumn Statement was strategically orientated to exploit traditional Conservative strengths and traditional Labour weaknesses. Sir Keir, ever-keen to present Labour as a responsible party after the Cobrynite experiment, was challenged to disagree with Sunak’s proposals. In the end, Labour’s inability to sign up wholeheartedly to the new fiscal orthodoxy exposed, in chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s analysis, a deficit of common sense in Labour ranks. When it comes to the government’s new anti-strike bill, the political thinking is essentially the same. Setting a trap… The new anti-strike legislation was introduced to the House on Tuesday by business secretary Grant Shapps. Citing risks posed to NHS patients, Shapps outlined that the new bill would require public sector services to run minimum levels of provision on strike days — essentially forcing a certain proportion of an industry to work or face the sack. The move harks back to a “golden age” of Conservative power over industrial relations. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have viewed strikes as a way to make their party look tough and discredit the Labour Party alongside the wider left. To be sure, we have already seen Starmer encounter some political difficulty in this latest wave of industrial action. In the summer, he chose to sack one-time frontbencher Sam Tarry for standing alongside picketing workers. For the Labour leader — intent on distancing his party from the unions — Tarry had crossed a very literal red line. But even if Starmer wants to downplay the connection, there is no escaping the fact that the Labour party is associated politically and financially with the trade union movement. With the new anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak hopes to implicate Labour in an upsurge of union militancy, thus slowing Starmer’s inexorable march towards Downing Street. It was telling that ministers chose to announce the new strike legislation within hours of the Labour leader’s “New year, New Vision” speech last week. Shapps’ pledge stole Starmer’s limelight and Labour’s newly announced “take back control bill” secured a grand total of zero newspaper front pages the following day. The politics of the new legislation also dominated Starmer’s post-speech press conference. Under a barrage of questioning, the Labour leader confirmed that his party will vote against the plans and repeal the Act if he takes power at the next election. It was all going to plan for Sunak. He had goaded Starmer out of hiding and forced the Labour leader to share an ideological platform with that favourite Conservative bogeyman: the so-called union “baron”. The PMQs’ attack lines wrote themselves. However, few would deny that the prime minister is playing a high-stakes political game with his new anti-strike bill. Although Starmer’s reaction could be accounted for, the government risks running into a hostile public backlash. Now a week on from when the legislation was announced, and many view the new proposals as needlessly and deliberately obstructive. Risk 1: The government is viewed as needlessly obstructive Although Conservative MPs imagine Mick Lynch as the new Arthur Scargill, the infamous union “baron” who led opposition to Margaret Thatcher, the general public is not so convinced. Instead, the political posturing around the new anti-strike bill may be viewed as deepening the industrial relations crisis and prolonging our winter of discontent. Furthermore, the new bills’ parliamentary progress is set to be slow, with a difficult House of Lords stage beckoning. And when/if the bill does eventually pass, its key provisions will unquestionably be tested in the courts before they can take effect, just as is the case with deportations to Rwanda. So with the proposed legislation unlikely to do anything to solve urgent disputes, the public may well wonder want the point is at all — if not to be deliberately coercive and punitive. Risk 2: Labour exploits support for striking nurses Another risk for Sunak is that by focussing on risks posed to NHS patients during the strikes, he ventures onto territory where the Labour Party is traditionally at its strongest. It is telling that Starmer has focused his attacks on the part of the bill which would allow employers to sack workers who defy a “work notice” by striking. At PMQs on Wednesday, Starmer accused the government of going from “clapping the nurses to sacking the nurses”. On Thursday came a new widely-shared graphic by order of Labour Party HQ, which accused Sunak of planning to give striking nurses “the finger”, Alan Sugar-style. This attack line works because it is not very far from the truth. As a result of the proposed law, individual nurses could be prosecuted and even jailed. These are the same people Sunak was pictured clapping for, as chancellor, throughout the pandemic. Risk 3: Sunak is viewed as a rigid, uncompromising ideologue Sunak’s desire to be seen as pragmatic and “reasonable” may be fundamentally undermined by the passage of this bill. In pursuing the new legislation, Sunak has abandoned his “managerialism” and political prudence, territory where the risk-averse Starmer is comfortable, in order to set up a battle over principles, territory where Starmer is not. Honing in on fundamental Labour-Conservative differences in a bid to exploiting the Labour leader’s risk-averse nature, Sunak hence risks exposing the worst aspects of Conservative ideology. While the prime minister may point to a more conciliatory tone in negotiations, there is no hiding that the new law is an act of explicitly Thatcherite homage. It is as provocative and divisive as much as practically possible, drawing on Conservatism’s collective memory of disputes in the 1980s. However, you cannot help but think that in picking a fight with NHS nurses, Sunak has chosen the wrong moment to abandon his “problem-solving” priorities and get dug in with Conservative dogma. One recent YouGov poll found that 64% of the public support the striking nurses. Rather than introducing anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak’s political future may be better served by getting around the negotiating table and constructively ending the industrial dispute once and for all. So with imagery of nurses in handcuffs circling — and with ordinary Britons desperate for some degree of normalcy to return, Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes looks destined to fail.",Week-in-Review: Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes is destined to fail,https://www.politics.co.uk/week-in-review/2023/01/13/week-in-review-sunaks-attempt-to-trap-starmer-on-strikes-is-destined-to-fail/

As energy experts focused on how data can be used in the transition to a low-carbon economy, we have closely followed how this volatility has played out in Britain. Full data for the year 2022 is now available and here are a few things we have noticed. Britain (we talk about Britain and not the UK, as Northern Ireland is part of an integrated Irish electricity grid) saw a 4% drop in electricity demand from 2021 – that’s the third largest year-on-year reduction after 2008 (caused by the shock of the global financial crash) and pandemic-affected 2020. It takes Britain’s overall electricity demand back to values last seen in the 1980s, an 18% reduction from its peak in 2005. This time two years ago, we stated that COVID lockdowns meant electricity demand would never be so low again. We got it wrong. In fact, 2022 was the lowest year by some margin (2% lower than 2020). We believe the main factors for this drop were the significant increase in prices, the wider media attention on this, and the wider cost of living crisis. From importer to exporter The earliest undersea high-voltage direct current cable (known as an interconnector) from Britain to another country’s power grid was laid in 1961 across the Strait of Dover to France. In the years since, another seven have been constructed: two to Ireland, one to Belgium, one to the Netherlands, one to Norway and a further two to France. More interconnectors are under construction or proposed, including a connection with Denmark due to go live at the end of 2023. Since 1978, Britain has always used these cables to import more electricity than it exported over a given year. Over the past decade, an average of 5% of the country’s electricity has been imported, helping to reduce the amount it needed to generate itself. However, net imports swung to net exports in 2022 for the first time in 44 years. Looking at the individual interconnectors, it was the link to France that caused this significant change. In 2021, there were 14 terawatt-hours (TWh) of net imports from France whereas in 2022, there were 10 TWh to France. This is an enormous swing of 24 TWh from a single point of connection, and represents the largest annual change in a single electricity source since the shift from coal to gas in 2015/16. To put 24 TWh in context, this is broadly similar to the amount of electricity Scotland uses each year, or the annual output from Britain’s onshore wind generation. So what happened? Over the past year, French nuclear power stations had many maintenance problems which led to significant reductions in their output. In August, 57% of the country’s generation capacity was not being used. Despite a modest recovery, as of January 2023, 15 of its 56 reactors were closed for repairs. All this meant nuclear-reliant France had to import electricity from neighbouring countries. This led to more electricity being generated in Britain than would otherwise have been the case, to satisfy the additional demand from France. So while Britain’s renewable generation was at a record level, its fossil fuel generation was also higher than in the previous year. Without the problems in France, 2022 could have been the first year that Britain’s wind, solar and hydro combined generated more electricity than its fossil fuels – a milestone that will happen anyway over the next couple of years. Wind is cheap, but your electricity isn’t Wind generation also recovered from its relatively poor output in 2021 to reach a record generation of 77 TWh. That’s a 24% increase on the preceding year, when capacity increased by just 11%. This sudden increase highlights the year-to-year variations that need to be planned for to have a robust and resilient decarbonised power system, including longer duration energy storage. Renewables (including generation from biomass) contributed nearly 40% of Britain’s total generation in 2022. This progress, along with the lower demand for electricity within Britain, meant emissions from the power sector were broadly similar to previous years (though would have been lower if imports from France had continued). The rising prices of electricity and gas have contributed to a cost of living crisis, putting millions in fuel poverty. And though renewables and nuclear together provided over half of Britain’s electricity in 2022, the system is still overwhelmingly influenced by prices set by fossil fuel plants. Reforms are urgently needed here to decouple the price of low-carbon electricity from that of fossil fuels.",Britain is a net electricity exporter for first time in 44 years,https://theconversation.com/britain-is-a-net-electricity-exporter-for-first-time-in-44-years-197506

The Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the BBC's Today programme and the rest of the doomsters may be convinced that we face some terrible economic apocalypse. But the facts refuse to oblige. Confounding all expectations, output in Britain grew by 0.1pc in November, leading financial analyst across the City to upgrade forecasts. That means we're not in a recession after all. And it could get even better when we see the official December data. In spite of all the doom and gloom about a disastrous seasonal shopping season British consumers did what they do best and opened their wallets. The result? Retail sales soared — right in the midst of the 'cost of living crisis'. Growth in November was driven by the UK's resilient services sector — everything from haircuts and shopping malls to the banks and legal services of the City, as well as entertainment and communications. It accounts for nearly 79 per cent of our national output. (Construction was flat, hindered by rising interest rates, while manufacturing dipped.) So in spite of months of bad news from Downing Street in the form of tax hikes and budget cuts — as well as a seemingly never-ending stream of headlines about soaring energy bills, rampant inflation and relentless strike actions — Christmas 2022 brought excellent economic news. From the high street to the retail park, sales were brisk. Shopping boomed across the country, with almost every category in the sector — be it supermarket groceries, beauty products at Boots, or Nike Air Force trainers — keeping the tills rattling throughout the festive period. Marks & Spencer, far from being the busted flush of popular imagination, saw turkeys and sparkling wine help to deliver a 6.3 per cent gain in sales through its food halls. Mid-market Sainsbury's, thought to be a victim of competition from German value retailers Aldi and Lidl, also defied the odds with a 7.1 per cent rise in sales over Christmas. High street giants Tesco, Next and Lidl have all done impressively, too. as have local favourites Greggs and Boots. Corks were also popping at the UK's biggest wine retailer Majestic, where price cuts brought shoppers through the doors in droves. Stunningly, sales were 21.1 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. JD Sports, meanwhile, recorded a 20 per cent lift in sales over the holiday period, driven by 2.6 million pairs of Nike trainers. But it's not just shops. In aviation, passenger numbers at Heathrow were up 90 per cent on the 2021 festive period — when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 blighted festive getaways — defying industrial action by border staff. Elsewhere, in spite of this week's aborted Virgin Orbit launch in Cornwall, the UK's space sector is booming, with Germany's Rocket Factory Augsburg signing a multi-year partnership for a planned launch on the Shetland Islands. The industry generates £16.5 billion of income. And, in another boost, this week's news of a gas find in the southern North Sea by a Shell-led consortium has been hailed as 'fantastic'. The good tidings continue. The Office for National Statistics reported this week that, in 2021, UK output per hour worked 'had the fastest growth of the G7 countries'. Not something likely to lead BBC headlines. Banking giant JP Morgan Chase says that about three-quarters of its mid-size UK business leaders (the backbone of our economy) plan to grow their enterprises this year — and have no plans to shed jobs. So, when all this is accounted for, and despite all the dire talk from the Bank of England and others about the longest recession in our history, things could be turning out far better than expected. And saying this matters. Because drumbeats of bad economic forecasts can fast become self-perpetuating, ramping up the gloom and helping to delay our recovery. Even Doomster-in-Chief — Chancellor Jeremy Hunt — now believes that the economic slow-down will be milder than forecast. So why isn't he — and, indeed, our glum Prime Minister — leading by example and shouting the positive news from the rooftops? After all, it is the Conservative Party's 'energy price guarantee' on people's bills (established under the Liz Truss debacle and largely embraced by Sunak and Hunt), along with targeted help for the poorest families unveiled by Sunak when he was still at the Treasury, that together have taken the sting out of household gas and electricity costs. And that's in addition to the recent sharp fall in the price of wholesale gas, as a result of the extraordinarily mild European winter — one of the warmest in half a century. This has reduced demand and lowered tariffs, further helping to cut the cost of living. Yet despite these successes, Nos 10 and 11 have echoed the pessimistic economists who were still insisting at the end of last year that consumers as well as retailers were bound to suffer badly this winter. The British Retail Consortium's Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said in early December that 'the cost of living crisis means many families might dial back their festive plans'. She could not have been more wrong. It's clear then that, while cost pressures are real, people have not stopped spending. How is this possible? Amid the purported misery, it seems families are still determined to enjoy themselves. My view is that the soothsayers have underestimated two post-pandemic factors. That big savings balances approaching £200 billion, built-up during the pandemic, have been sitting around ready to be spent. And that, ahead of the holidays, fewer credit cards had been swiped to their limits than in previous years. The British Retail Consortium continues to warn that because of further rises in the cost of living, retailers face headwinds in 2023. Maybe so. But inflation is forecast to fall dramatically, wholesale gas prices have tumbled and the employment market remains strong, with more than 1 million vacancies. The pessimism is being overdone. There is still some way to go, but that should not preclude our leaders hailing the resilience of the British consumer, or the skill with which industries across the board managing their way through difficult times.

The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said the new strike days are in addition to the previously announced 16-day programme of rolling strike action, set to begin in schools across the country next week. The EIS Executive Committee met on Friday and agreed action that will include two days of strikes in all schools and sectors on February 28 and March 1, followed by a rolling programme of strikes for 20 days between March 13 and April 21. Each local authority area will be impacted by three consecutive days of strikes, with one day affecting all schools bookended on either side by one-day strikes in primary and secondary schools. EIS members have previously taken three days of strikes, one in November and two in January, in the continuing campaign for a fair pay settlement for the year 2022. Primary and secondary schools were closed on Tuesday January 10 and Wednesday January 11 after last-ditch talks with the Scottish Government failed. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. Speaking after the meeting of EIS Executive Committee, general secretary Andrea Bradley said: “The programme of additional strike action, agreed today, is a direct response to the inaction of the Scottish Government and Cosla (Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) on teacher pay. “After a year of dither, delay and disingenuity from the Scottish Government and Cosla, Scotland’s teachers have simply had enough.” Ms Bradley added: “The recent days of strike action by Scotland’s teachers have succeeded in bringing Cosla and the Scottish Government back to the negotiating table but they have yet to put a single extra penny onto that table. “Scotland’s teachers rejected a sub-inflationary 5% offer six months ago, and little or no progress has been made in negotiations since. “The prospect of 22 additional days of strike action, on top of the 16 days of rolling action set to begin next week, should signal clearly to the Scottish Government and Cosla that they must now act with urgency. “Our members are resolute and determined to secure a fair pay settlement, which both properly reflects their value and also takes account of the soaring cost of living.” Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “Strikes in our schools are in no one’s interest – including for pupils, parents and carers who have already had to deal with significant disruption over the past three years. “It is disappointing that the EIS has proceeded to escalate industrial action – we are continuing to urge teaching unions to reconsider their plans while talks are ongoing. “Recent discussions have been constructive. There has been a shared understanding that talks have been focused on discussing potential areas for compromise – not on tabling a new offer at this stage. “To date we have made four offers, all of which have been rejected, but we remain absolutely committed to reaching an agreement on a pay deal that is fair and sustainable for all concerned.”",Teaching union announces 22 more days of strike action in Scotland,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-government-scotland-children-education-secretary-b2261914.html

Ministers have accused workers of putting lives at risk during strikes. In response, Downing Street said it ""greatly valued"" ambulance workers and the ""door remains open"" for talks. GMB represent more than 10,000 ambulance workers who went on strike on Wednesday across nine ambulance services in England and Wales. Steve Rice, writing on behalf of the GMB Ambulance Committee, said he was ""appalled"" at recent government statements and accused ministers of attempting to remove workers' right to strike . He wrote: ""We feel utterly betrayed by the way your government has singled out ambulance workers as part of a crude attempt to remove our right to strike. ""You and your ministers should be ashamed of the way you have tried to paint us as uncaring about safety standards -nothing could be further from the truth. ""We want a constructive relationship with government - to talk about pay and seriously improve conditions throughout the ambulance service. But you are making us and our ambulance colleagues feel demonised."" Mr Rice concludes: ""please talk to us and stop attacking us."" The letter comes after the prime minister described the industrial action as ""terrifying"". He told the Commons on Wednesday: ""What is terrifying is that right now people do not know whether, when they call 999, they will get the treatment they need."" Business Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs that ""a lack of timely co-operation"" from unions was ""putting their constituents' lives at risk."" Responding to the GMB letter, Downing Street said the health secretary's door remains open to talks with unions and it has accepted the independent pay review body's recommendation to give one million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. A spokesperson said: ""However, we must keep the public safe, which is why we are introducing minimum service and safety levels across a range of sectors to ensure that lives and livelihoods are not lost."" Mr Sunak said he hoped to ""find a way through"" the deadlock with unions to avert further industrial action and touted the minimum service level legislation. The Bill is due to considered by MPs again on Monday. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Ministers know this shoddy, unworkable Bill won't do a thing to help working people or avoid strikes.""

Around half of Britain’s railway lines are closed and only a fifth of services are running as tens of thousands of workers at Network Rail and train operators walk out on the second day of the strike with bus drivers joining them. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction and said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline,” he wrote. Transport for London has revealed that bus strikes will take place today and tomorrow on Abellio bus services. There will still be buses available on the affected routes in south and west London, but not in their usual numbers. Meanwhile, industrial action by the UK-wide National Highways and Rural Payments Agency staff will continue. Recommended Who’s on strike today?

It wasn’t until this past year watching Musk, Johnson, Trump, King Charles, Truss, Clarkson (who is not out of the woods, however much cover The Sun give him) etc that it occurred to me that, if you are patient enough and prepared to witness massive collateral damage and waste of resources and unnecessary heartache, worsening socio-economic inequality and the debasement of living conditions for the most vulnerable – “they” implode...

Rishi Sunak has been warned that his “high risk” strategy on public sector pay rises could backfire, as an exclusive poll for The Independent showed strong public support for fresh strikes in 2023. Almost two in three voters would back NHS nurses taking more strike action next year if their pay demands are not met, the Savanta poll found, with only 24 per cent opposed. In addition, more voters expressed support for fresh industrial action by rail staff, bus drivers, postal workers and teachers than those who said they were opposed to further strikes. Adam Forrest reports: What does Britain really think about the strikes? As unions and government continue their stand-off, voters are still backing the workers who have chosen to walk out, polling finds – and they support more strikes in the new year, Adam Forrest reports Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 02:48 1672796880 As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be a good year for the unions After decades when it was – sadly – usually safe to ignore the pronouncements of union leaders, the most widespread outbreak of industrial action since 1979 has meant that they are household names once again. Not yet as familiar as, say, Mick Lynch, is the brand new general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, who formally takes over from Frances (now Baroness) O’Grady on 1 January. He is, though, making a somewhat loud entrance. He told The Independent that the strikes could carry on throughout 2023 if the government refuses to negotiate over pay rises. If we take ministers at their word, that they won’t do so until at least the new public pay body recommendations arrive in April, then the country is in for a prolonged period of conflict. Writes Sean O’Grady: As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be good for the unions The economic reality is on the side of the unions, and Rishi Sunak lacks Thatcher’s sharp political instinct, writes Sean O'Grady Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 01:48 1672793280 I’m a nurse – this is why I voted to strike Ever since I was a young child, I dreamt of being a nurse that worked for the NHS. Twelve years ago, after lots of hard work and determination, I achieved that goal. There were lots of sacrifices from my family, who supported me throughout my course. I currently work as a deputy sister in an NHS hospital in Lincolnshire. My role is as part of an acute cardiology team that has face to face contact with patients that attend the hospital after having heart attacks and following cardiac arrests.

RCN members in England will continue their strike. 23 January Unison members working for five ambulance services in England will stage another walkout. 25 January London bus workers at Abellio will go on strike. 26 January London bus workers at Abellio will continue strike. Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 23:34 1672786137 Who is striking this winter and why? Workers in several of Britain’s key service sectors are striking in what is being called the new “winter of discontent” as cost of living pressures clash with below-inflation pay offers. Many strikes, such as that of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), have been going on for months, with warnings union members will vote to take their fight far into 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the highest monthly total since November 2011 saw mass public sector walkouts over pension reforms. Liam James reports: Who is striking this winter and why? Workers are walking out in droves over the coming weeks Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 22:48 1672783170 Bus strikes planned for Wednesday TfL has said that strike are planned for Wednesday and Thursday on Abellio bus services. On the strike days, TfL writes that they intend to run as many services as possible, but expect disruption. Routes affected by the strikes are, for the most part, in west and south London. Other bus services will not be affected.

The wild salmon is one of Scotland’s most iconic species, earning its place alongside the red deer, the golden eagle, and the Scottish wildcat. But, like so many other animals, its numbers have been in decline for decades. The population of wild salmon is diminishing on the west coast of Scotland, and even faster on the east coast. Reasons for the fall are many and varied, but a key cause is habitat loss and rising river temperatures, due to climate change. The Scottish Government has also identified other pressures facing wild salmon, including predation by fish, birds and seals, as well as the non-native plans that erode riverbanks. Man-made barriers to migration, such as weirs and bridge foundations, lead to further challenges for the fish, impeding their migration to spawning grounds and increasing the likelihood of them being eaten. The sad truth is that a wild Atlantic salmon now has a miniscule survival rate of only around 1-2%. That contrasts sharply with farm-raised salmon, where the survival rate is around 85% over their two years in the cold seas off Scotland’s west coast. Daily animal husbandry from our salmon farmers, supported by the best vets in the land, has developed world-leading expertise in hatching and rearing salmon that thrive at sea. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part There are a handful of vocal activists, often from urban centres far from rural Scotland, determined to shut down salmon farms – which would make 12,000 people unemployed amid a cost of living crisis – who mistakenly believe that this would somehow help wild salmon. They have no explanation, of course, for the fact that wild salmon numbers are declining at the same rate on the east coast, where there has never been any salmon farming. What is needed is collaboration, not confrontation. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part in finding solutions, engaging constructively with the wild fish sector, and taking meaningful action to save wild salmon. They are determined, for example, to share their knowledge and experience to support wild fisheries with restocking. Fortunately, most people in the fisheries and angling sectors in the Highlands and Islands recognise the importance of a healthy, shared environment, ensuring fish can thrive in our waters. People like Jon Gibb, a fisheries manager based in Fort William, get that. He has long championed a constructive relationship between the farm-raised salmon sector and fisheries and angling groups, arguing that “both the farmed and wild salmon sectors have a common interest to thrive in our shared space”. I agree, which is why I’m delighted that Jon has agreed to coordinate our revamped £1.5 million “wild fisheries fund”, which is paid for directly by Scotland’s salmon farming companies. Funding to protect our salmon heritage The Scottish salmon sector has already funded projects to save and restore a historic dam in the Western Isles that assists wild salmon to progress to their spawning grounds, as well as restoration projects across Scotland that will reduce riverbank erosion and provide tree canopy and in-stream cover for young salmon. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks In the coming year, £145,000 will be available to a broad range of organisations and projects. Applications are invited from fisheries organisations, including local angling clubs, fishery boards and other community associations. The revamped fund will prioritise applications of a practical nature, which aim to protect and enhance wild salmon populations and local angling opportunities, recognising that salmon and trout fishing is at the cultural heart of many Highland communities, and provides human health benefits. Projects could include removing migration barriers, evidence-based and authorised restocking programmes, hatchery-based operations using contemporary techniques, such as genetic screening, and freshwater habitat improvement, like spawning gravel creation. Money is also available for improvements to angling facilities, including riverside paths, boats and buildings, as well as initiatives to support young and disabled anglers. Scottish salmon is part of our national story. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks. We recognise that today’s Scottish salmon farming sector enjoys its strong reputation and success partly due to this heritage. It is in all of our interests to ensure that we protect our freshwater and seawater environment so that one of Scotland’s most iconic species can recover and thrive.

Hardies Property & Construction Consultants is currently renovating its offices in the city. Once the offices on Albert Square are ready, bosses plan to have staff from Hardies and its sister company Shepherds working under the same roof. They will be joined by workers from the recently-acquired John Duguid Partnership. Hardies investment in Dundee offices Gareth Cordiner, the firm’s north division managing partner, believes this will make a real difference. He said: “It’s hugely important especially after Covid. We do have a flexible working policy but we’ve found people want to be back in the office and back together. “The amount of information you share from hearing it across the room, it makes a big difference. “From a mental health point of view it’s brilliant. You see relationships building again, so there’s huge benefits.” Douglas Smith, who was appointed Dundee partner recently, added: “We’ll have our one-stop-shop under one roof and that’s really exciting. “It needs to be a more modern way, with collective thinking.” Mr Smith also outlined his ambition for Hardies to become the go-to business for anyone’s surveying requirements in Dundee. “It’s a pretty exciting time for Hardies in Dundee,” he said. “We’ve got a fairly big team that are looking to make giant strides in the Tayside area moving forward. “We’re trying to build the Hardies brand. “In Dundee, we’re trying to make it a one-stop shop surveying service across all disciplines – building surveying, quantity surveying, you name it, we’re doing it. “We’re going to target sectors we want to work in.” Tayside offices crucial for Hardies Mr Cordiner said its presence in Tayside and Fife – the firm also has offices in Dunfermline, St Andrews and Perth – are key to the business. He added: “Dundee and Perth work closely together as the Tayside region. “Historically in Dundee quantity surveying-wise, we’re historically very strong and very well known. “Joining up with the John Duguid Partnership we’re keen that we become the strongest quantity surveying team in Tayside. “I don’t think we’re far off that at the moment.” Mr Smith said the firm’s progress would be based on “considered and selective movement”.",Dundee property firm looking to make &#8216;giant strides&#8217; in Tayside,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/business-environment/business/4001080/hardies-dundee/

Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. It comes as rail workers continue a 48 hour strike, with more stoppages planned this month in the transport industry, NHS and civil service. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it.” “This is simply unsustainable. But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers.

""A strong domestic and secure steel industry is also fundamental to delivering the UK Government’s ambitious energy plans. “But if British manufacturers are to supply the essential steel and continue to employ many thousands of people in this country, we need to invest and transform this strategically-important industry so it can make carbon-neutral steel. “Similarly, our steel industry is at a crossroads – if we do nothing, we risk it declining and drifting away to other countries. Down the other path is a new era in which we transform the steel production process to make it fit for the 21st Century.” Henrik added: “Geo-political events and disruptive trade issues in recent years have reminded us of the importance of being self-sufficient in essential products like steel, a product critical for the UK’s infrastructure projects, manufacturing industry and national security.” Roy Rickhuss CBE, General Secretary of Community and NTUSCC Chair, said: “The green energy revolution presents a huge opportunity to build a robust British supply chain based on the supply of top-quality domestic steel.""

British wrestler Zack Sabre Jr, who has been vocally anti-Tory in the past, stepped out for a high stakes match at New Japan Pro Wrestling’s (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom 17 event in front of a packed Tokyo Dome crowd. With a global audience tuning in to see former WWE superstar Sasha Banks make her heavily rumoured debut, the 35-year-old grappler took his opportunity to shine a light on the action being taken by the Royal College of Nursing (RNC). Back in November, for the first first time in its 106 year history the RNC voted in favour of strikes, as walkouts affected hospitals across the country with more set to take place on January 18 and 19. Zack has joined those criticising the government over the dispute, and he sent a very blunt message for the Prime Minister as he made his entrance on Wednesday (January 4). Looking straight down the camera, he said: ‘Hey Rishi Sunak! Pay nurses, d**khead! Pay nurses a living wage!’ Zack has a message for the prime minister pic.twitter.com/ECbWf0EX1O— Elijah (@eli1ah) January 4, 2023 Zack Sabre Jr has fans around the world (Picture: Etsuo Hara/Getty Images) Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said last month that the union had ‘no choice’ but to arrange the upcoming strikes. She said: ‘The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January. ‘The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.’ The union is campaigning for a five percent pay rise above inflation to help nurses overcome those real-terms pay cuts, to support nursing staff through the cost of living crisis and recognise their critical skills. There are also record nursing vacancies, with 25,000 nursing staff having quit in the past year, but Mr Sunak previously said while the government was open to talks, a demand for a 19% pay rise wasn’t affordable. He told BBC News NI in December: ‘The health secretary has always been clear that his door is always open for talks – we want to be reasonable, we want to be constructive. ‘We’ve got enormous gratitude for all public sector workers for the job they do, and I know things are difficult right now.’ Got a story?

Al-Quds reported that they had been deported for a range of reasons, including drug abuse, theft, expiration of residency and acting against the public interest. Egyptians are the largest expat group in Kuwait, constituting 24 per cent of the workforce, though that number looks set to reduce as the government works on controlling the labour market and reducing the number of expats across all sectors, particularly within the government. In 2018 Kuwait's Civil Service Commission issued a decree to replace expats in government jobs with Kuwaitis over the next five years. Since then, authorities have rolled out a series of measures aimed at reducing foreign workers in the country. In 2020 Kuwait's parliament said it wanted to reduce the number of Egyptians in the country to ten per cent and introduced a draft law to that effect. In December this year the Kuwaiti government imposed new conditions on Egyptian workers wishing to travel to the Gulf State including a $100 entry fee, an increased work permit documentation fee and a medical examination. READ: Kuwait: death sentence for man who killed woman who refused his advances At the time, Deputy Prime Minister Talal Al-Khaled suspended a 2018 memorandum of understanding which was originally signed to facilitate recruitment between the two countries but did not officially inform Egypt it was being terminated. Four months earlier Kuwait announced that it would lay off 250,000 Egyptian workers and suspend all contracts with non-nationals as 500,000 other Egyptians were already set to lose their jobs. Egyptians have suffered racism in the Gulf country with a video of a Kuwaiti customer slapping an Egyptian cashier two years ago going viral. One influencer called Egyptians ""filthy servants."" Even though they are the largest expatriate group in Kuwait, Egyptians lack employment rights and safety provision. In November last year an Egyptian construction worker was killed in Kuwait allegedly after his colleagues dumped rubbish on him from the third floor after not realising he was below them. A 2015 report on migrant rights found that industry corruption, including overextending project timelines and using cheap materials, put construction workers at risk.

Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan told the PA news agency it was “inevitable” that further strikes will be held unless there is a breakthrough to the long running row.

Mr Whelan told PA he felt rail employers and the Government were “playing games” rather than making any serious attempt to resolve the pay dispute. “The situation is getting worse and my members now want to go harder and faster because of the lack of progress. “We are in a weird world where the Government will do anything to keep private companies in the industry. “It is inevitable that more strikes will be held and probably escalate. “The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us. “We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing, and that is unacceptable.” Among the operators which will run no trains all day on Thursday are Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Northern, Southern, Southeastern, Thameslink and TransPennine Express.

He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay.

Mr Whelan told PA he felt rail employers and the Government were “playing games” rather than making any serious attempt to resolve the pay dispute. “The situation is getting worse and my members now want to go harder and faster because of the lack of progress. “We are in a weird world where the Government will do anything to keep private companies in the industry. “It is inevitable that more strikes will be held and probably escalate. “The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government.

New TUC leader Paul Nowak has written to the Prime Minister calling for an urgent meeting to discuss the wave of industrial disputes across the country including on the railways, NHS and civil service. He called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. In the letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing”. He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. “We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love.

Next, we need to stop seeing education is something that ends at age 18 or that sees university as the only option with more technical education, lifelong learning and apprenticeship,” he said. We're holding the first BUSINESSiQ Awards - to nominate someone, CLICK HERE He told an audience in Stratford: “One of the biggest changes in mindset we need in education today is to reimagine our approach to numeracy. Right now, just half of all 16 to 19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills, is letting our children down.” Rishi Sunak (Image: PA) Grant Glendinning, Chief Executive and Group Principal at Education Training Collective (Etc.), replied: “I fully agree with the Prime Minister, opportunity is intrinsically linked with education – ensuring that learners have access to the best possible learning experiences. However, while maths, and English, are important and critical foundations of any education pathway towards employment, they do not work in isolation. ""Skills as a whole, starting with English and maths, developed from primary into secondary education, supported by additional learning and development in further education or in the workplace as part of an apprenticeship or T Level, are what will see our young people best positioned to take advantage of the careers and opportunities they pursue, supporting the economic growth of our country. Grant Glendinning (Image: Press release) It will be interesting to understand how this will be rolled out, but with the best interests of our learners and our communities firmly at the heart of Etc. colleges, it is difficult to see how enhanced skills development can be anything but a positive.” Zoe Lewis, Principal and Chief Executive of Middlesbrough College, told us: ""The UK is one of the few developed nations that reduces the time spent in education from around 25 hours per week from the age of 5 to 16 years old to around 16 hours per week between the ages of 16 and 18. Zoe Lewis (Image: Press release) ""We would welcome any opportunity to increase the hours available to continue the development of key skills required for life and the workplace in our young people, whether this be mathematics, English, digital, physical education or employability skills. ""Whilst we would not necessarily single out mathematics from the list of priority skills, we would very much support any increase in investment between in the ages of 16 and 18, alongside a clear plan as to how we can develop and train the increased numbers of teachers that would be required, in light of the current shortages across the sector."" Henri Murison, Chief Executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership said businesses needed young people who were ready for work: ""The Prime Minister is right to be concerned about the progress made by disadvantaged children in this country,"" he said. ""It is simply not good enough that 60% of children do not receive a high enough grade at GCSE in maths to make it on to a T-Level course or other vocation routes to further study. Henri Murison (Image: Press release) ""However it's worth noting that already many young people are studying maths post 16 through resits, in order to get the grade they need to make it through to the system to achieve a higher level of skills.

After the disappointments of the previous decade, this was to be the time when the global economy powered up and got going again. There would be a flowering of new technologies and a colossal boom. It would be the roaring 20s all over again. It hasn’t worked out like that. Instead, the world faces the grim prospect of a second recession in three years. The three biggest economies – the United States, China and the European Union, which between them account for roughly half of all global output – are slowing at the same time. That’s unusual and troubling. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, says a third of the world economy will be in recession in 2023, and even for countries that manage to keep growing it will feel like a recession. The IMF has got it wrong – sometimes seriously wrong – in the past but even so, Georgieva’s pessimism is warranted. Just about every indicator of looming recession is flashing red. Prices are rising faster than wages, reducing consumer spending power. Corporate profitability is being squeezed by rising costs and weakening demand. Developing countries that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are now finding their debt burdens unmanageable. The two big asset bubbles of the post-pandemic era – crypto-currencies and tech stocks – both collapsed in 2022. Central banks are raising interest rates, exposing the vulnerability of “zombie” companies that have survived only thanks to a prolonged period of low interest rates. It is a lot cheaper in the US to borrow money for 10 years than it is to borrow money for one year. In the past this unusual phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale sign of a recession in the offing. China hauled the global economy out of its last serious downturn but is in no shape to do so this time. House prices have been rising at double-digit rates for the past three decades but are now falling in many cities because the boom has led to more and more homes being built. Politically, President Xi Jinping cannot afford a house price crash so he can bring demand and supply back into balance only by curbing property construction. That, coupled with the increase in coronavirus cases since the end of the zero tolerance approach to Covid-19, means China is the country to watch in 2023. The IMF says that for the first time since the early 1990s, China will grow less quickly than the global economy as a whole. It could be worse than the IMF envisages. So, the big question is not whether the global economy is in for a rough year in the 12 months ahead, because that is clearly the case. There may be one or two countries that buck the trend, but the UK is not going to be one of them. Another year of underperformance will keep the debate about Brexit alive, even though adjustment to life outside the EU is not the only – let alone the principal reason – for the UK’s current predicament. This is a global rather than a UK-specific problem, and it predates Brexit. Nor is the question why the bounce-back from the Covid-19 pandemic has been cut short, because that too is obvious. The post-lockdown recovery was built on the shakiest of foundations. Shortages led to a burst of inflation, amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks in the west found themselves powerless to combat a cost of living crisis other than by jacking up interest rates. The recessions or near recessions that will be seen in the US, the EU and the UK this year are no accident. They are a deliberate act of policy, which central bankers justify by saying it is a choice between pain now or more pain later. No, the real issue is whether the roaring 20s have been delayed or will never arrive. Put another way: is the global economy facing a temporary, if nasty, period of stagflation (a combination of weak growth and high inflation) or something deeper: a crisis of capitalism? And if it is the latter, what can be done about it? History may well repeat itself. The 1920s began with a pandemic, an inflationary boom and a deep recession. It took a while for better times to arrive, and when they did the driving force was a wave of new inventions, first developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but which took time to reveal their full potential. Techno-optimists say artificial intelligence and biotechnology will be to the 2020s what radio and the motorcar were to the 1920s: the catalyst for a period of markedly faster growth. They believe a period of abnormally lower interest rates has held back a fourth industrial revolution by allowing no-hoper companies to stagger on. A period of creative destruction will see this misallocation of capital end, leading to higher investment in the industries of the future. But the global economy has now been in the doldrums for 15 years. Money has been cheap and plentiful ever since the banks nearly went bust during the global financial crisis. There is not much evidence to suggest that the fourth industrial revolution is being held back by a shortage of capital. Rather, there has been a reluctance by both governments and the private sector to invest. Governments could have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs to rebuild clapped-out infrastructure, but failed to do so. The private sector preferred to use profits to buy back shares rather than taking a punt on new products. Financial engineering proved lucrative for elites, who assumed – quite wrongly – that because the system was working for them it was working for everybody. In one respect, the roaring 20s have already returned. While living standards are being squeezed for the many, for the super-rich it is a new gilded age. Three factors were behind the massive jump in productivity in the middle decades of the 20th century: ideas, investment and the struggle against inequality. Economies only really started to motor when new products were available to the masses through policies that encouraged full employment, collective bargaining and rising wages. Currently, there are plenty of ideas but the other two factors are missing. Until that changes, the global economy will be stuck in its low-growth rut.

It is estimated just 10% of services will be running on one of the worst days of action for decades. Around 12,500 train drivers from 15 firms will take part in the mass walkout. It comes as over the last week we have seen strike action from 40,000 workers on Network Rail and 14 train operating companies who have continued to strike. RMT members were on strike for 48 hours causing travel chaos for people across the UK. But today it is the turn of Aslef – which represents 96% of the train drivers in England, Scotland and Wales – who will continue into their second day of strikes in two days. Rail workers on the picket line at Grand Central Station in Birmingham yesterday (Picture: PA) MORE : What strikes are planned around New Year 2023? Trains, London buses, road workers and more The strike will bring services on affected lines to a halt and comes as more and more people in many different sectors of the economy are withdrawing their labour as employers refuse to help their employees during the cost-of-living crisis. But it’s not the end, as those from The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers are also set to walk out tomorrow and on Friday. It includes train drivers at 15 rail operators and is likely to shut down much of the country’s rail network. On all five days of action, trains will start later and finish much earlier than usual, running between 7.30am and 6.30pm, National Rail has warned. Tickets for 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 January can instead be used the day before the date on the ticket, or up to and including Tuesday 10 January.

Train drivers are joined today by London bus workers at Abellio, who are striking for eight days in total this month. Abellio buses have been affected on strike days – with other buses running but busier than usual. The action started back on December 8, but the bus strike dates around New Year included today and yesterday. Dozens of buses in London are going to be impacted by strikes. Rural Payments Agency (RPA) staff will also resume their strikes. Driving tests have likewise been disrupted today – with DVSA driving examiners’ strike starting in London, the South East, South Wales and the South West. ‘We don’t want to go on strike but the companies have pushed us into this place,’ said Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He added: ‘They have not offered our members at these companies a penny – and these are people who have not had an increase since April 2019. ‘That means they expect train drivers at these companies to take a real-terms pay cut – to work just as hard for considerably less – when inflation is running at north of 14%.’ Mick said: ‘The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us. ‘We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing.

The latest statistics on Scotland’s energy production (not oil and gas reserves) showed that over the first nine months of 2022, generation was up 34.7% compared to the same period in 2021 Final figures for 2021 show that the equivalent of 85.2% of all electricity used in Scotland (total generation minus net exports) came from renewable sources. Due to slightly better weather in 2021 this was actually a slight decrease, but has bounced back up again with the 2022 figures. The energy that is generated in Scotland is exported into the UK National Grid. Consumers in Scotland then buy it back. The further north you go in Scotland the tariff paid for buying it back, increases. So although places like Orkney and the massive windfarms in the north of mainland Scotland are producing well over their own needs in renewables, they are also paying the highest prices to buy back their own locally produced power. Scotland produces most of its renewable energy through wind but hydro is also very important. The future with wave and tidal power makes Scotland’s future as a producer of clean energy very bright. Oil and Gas in the UK Scotland still produces large amounts of fossil fuels through its existing extensive oil and gas fields. The income generated from these sources goes into the UK Exchequer. The UK Government is also very keen to open up more oil and gas fields. Figures from the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) The oil and gas industry plays a central role in the economy of the United Kingdom. Oil and gas account for more than three-quarters of the UK’s total primary energy needs. Oil provides 97 per cent of the fuel for transport, and gas is a key fuel for heating and electricity generation. Transport, heating and electricity each account for about one-third of the UK’s primary energy needs. Oil and gas are also major feedstocks for the petrochemicals industries producing pharmaceuticals, plastics, cosmetics and domestic appliances. Wikipedia Click on this link for more information on UK Oil and Gas: North Sea Transition Authority Scotland’s Renewable Production Energy is mostly a reserved power to the UK Government. The Scottish Government has planning power over the development of wind farms as we have seen recently in Orkney (OIC Faray Windfarm Approved by Scottish Government Despite Reporter’s Recommendation to Refuse ) and licences to develop offshore wind. (Islanders Attend Consultation Events for the West of Orkney Windfarm) There is a major expansion of the wind generation sector in Scotland. In the last twelve months, renewable electricity capacity has risen, up 11.7% from September 2021 to 13.6 GW in September 2022. As of September 2022, 397 renewable electricity projects with a capacity of 17.1 GW are being progressed. 3.4 GW of these are under construction, most of which are offshore wind farms off the Moray Firth. 6.8 GW are awaiting construction and 6.9 GW in planning. The generation and use of energy is a complex picture in Scotland. As part of the UK and with a devolved system of government, control over energy is mostly reserved to the London Government. Oil and Gas is a major sector. The UK Government intends to expand both this and Nuclear production. As well as producing energy we also need to use less but as the weather in 2022 was better for renewable generation it also made our homes and businesses harder to heat. Fuel poverty should not exist in a country which generates so much energy – but it does because we do not control the price or have the means to do so. Scottish Government funded schemes to make our homes and businesses more energy efficient are extremely important (more about that here, Home Energy Scotland).

The Department for Transport (DfT) rejects the accusation, saying ministers have held “polite, constructive meetings” with union bosses. Train drivers employed by 15 rail firms have walked out for 24 hours in a dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions. It is the sixth Aslef drivers’ strike since summer 2022, and is bracketed by 48-hour stoppages by the main rail union, the RMT. Many operators will run no trains on Thursday. Ahead of the walk-out, Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, blamed ministers for triggering the strike. He told The Independent: “We currently have government that seems to want to destroy the railway and put it into managed decline, alienate the workforce, drive passengers off it by increasing fares on a regular basis and causing the problems that are currently there. “We find ourselves in a cycle of – I can only say – corruption, really. The government destroying the railway. The government’s caused this, the government can solve it.” The Department for Transport (DfT) rejected the comments, saying that the transport secretary Mark Harper and rail minister Huw Merriman had been talking to union leaders about their desire for a thriving railway. A spokesperson for the DfT said: “The transport secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long-term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation, and costing every household an extra £1,000.” When Mr Harper entered office 10 weeks ago, he said his top priority was to end the long and bitter tangle of rail disputes between Network Rail, the train operators and the unions. Another two-day RMT strike begins at midnight, causing the cancellation of four out of five trains across Great Britain and disrupting services until Sunday.

The events were created by Developing the Young Workforce (DYW) Inverness & Central Highland, in collaboration with the UHI Inverness college and Skills Development Scotland. They gave S2-S4 Inverness school pupils the opportunity to engage directly with NHS Highland workers and other employers, in a bid to help them make better informed decisions about their future careers. NHS Highland hosted stalls centred around a range of different professions under the health and care umbrella including healthcare science, medical, nursing, dental, midwifery, pharmacy, and adult social care. At each stall teams carried out different interactive “hands-on” activities with young people to provide some experience and educate them about the different services and job roles. Activities showcased included basic life support, clinical skills demonstrations, birthing activities, mental health awareness and dementia awareness with insights into the challenges posed for older adults, and much more. Lori Pattinson, workforce planning manager for NHS Highland was delighted. “We were so excited for our employees to have the chance to meet and engage with young people in order to inspire and inform them about future career opportunities in health and social care within NHS Highland,” she said. “We hope we’ve been able to encourage these young people to pursue a career in health or social care, and become a part of our future workforce.” Three events held at Inverness Royal Academy, Culloden Balloch Baptist Church and Millburn Academy, attracted about 1500 young people to meet with local employers and key sectors most important to the Highland economy, including construction, engineering, hospitality, retail and STEM, as well as health and social care.

Danske Bank has revised its previous forecast of a 0.5% annual fall in economic activity in 2023 downwards and now expects output to contract by about 1% next year. It believes the retail sector will be worst affected by recession, shrinking by 4.5% in 2023, more than twice a predicted contraction rate of 2.2% for this year. Conor Lambe, Danske Bank chief economist, said: “The UK economy contracted in the third quarter of 2022 and we think that economic activity in Northern Ireland is also likely to have declined. Output is then projected to fall further in the final quarter of the year and through most of next year, with both economies experiencing a period of recession as a number of factors adversely impact activity levels. “Inflation is expected to decline gradually during 2023 but remain elevated and weigh down on household purchasing power. Consumer confidence is also particularly low and monetary policy is tightening. “Looking forward, and while noting the considerable uncertainty around the outlook, we expect annual output in Northern Ireland to decline by around 1% next year.” But the bank has forecast that the economy will have grown by around 4% by the end of this year, reflecting a relative improvement on the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses and consumers have been hit by rising costs throughout 2022, with inflation prompting the Bank of England to increase interest rates to 3%. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK economy shrank by 0.3% over the three months to October, although there was a rebound in October itself. As well as retail, other consumer-facing sectors such as accommodation and food, along with arts, entertainment and recreation, are also predicted to take heavy hits during 2023. Danske Bank forecast declines of nearly 4% for both sectors. And output for manufacturing companies is also expected to shrink next year, with a 1.1% fall in output, while the construction sector is tipped for a similar rate of contraction. However, slight growth is predicted for the world of information and communication, as well as scientific and technical services. And education and administrative and support services are also predicted to avoid decline.",Northern Ireland facing continued recession in 2023,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/ulsterbusiness/news/northern-ireland-facing-continued-recession-in-2023-42264137.html

Children in years 1, 2 and 3, between the ages of five and eight, will be given age-appropriate lessons designed to introduce them to different careers, training and skills, and inspire them about the world of work. The £2.6m initiative will be introduced across 55 education investment areas, or “cold spots”, where school outcomes are the weakest, targeting 600,000 pupils in more than 2,200 primary schools. Pupils will get the chance to meet employers and “role models” from a range of industries, to try to raise aspirations and link learning to future jobs and careers they may pursue. They will be introduced to careers in the green economy, technology, engineering, construction, Stem, creative industries, aerospace, hospitality and healthcare. The Department for Education (DfE) said evidence had shown that children started to form ideas about their future when they began primary school, yet most careers guidance took place in secondary schools. In addition to the primary careers programme, the DfE also gave details of a new requirement for secondary school pupils to be given greater exposure to providers of technical education, so they know about alternatives to a traditional academic route. Under legislation that came into force at the start of the year, schools will be required to give all pupils in years 8 to 13 at least six opportunities to meet a range of providers of technical education, including apprenticeships, T-levels and higher technical qualifications. Robert Halfon, the minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said good careers advice was vital to open up opportunities for young people from all backgrounds and create the future workforce the UK needed. “The changes we are making to boost our careers programme will raise ambitions from an early age for thousands of children in primary schools across the country, while providing opportunities to unlock talent, think about skills, engage with employers and discover different workplaces.” Oli de Botton, a former headteacher who is chief executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company, which will coordinate the primary careers programme, said: “Our new primary programme will bring careers inspiration to children early in their school life by connecting them with role models and showing them how different subjects relate to jobs.” The education charity Teach First will help train primary school teachers in disadvantaged areas where the scheme will be introduced. Dominic Wyse, a professor of early childhood and primary education at University College London’s Institute of Education, said the initiative’s success would depend on how well it was delivered. “It does worry me it could be terribly dull. There’s a real question – will it motivate children, will it motivate teachers, and is it the sort of push that’s needed right now?” Sarah Hannafin, a senior policy adviser for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), whose members mainly work in the primary sector, said it was right that careers education should not be left to secondary schools. However, she added: “All schools must be provided with the resources they need to provide high-quality careers education, but current provision remains underfunded. Schools will find it challenging to meet increasing requirements and expectations with no additional resources to deliver them.”",Children as young as five in England target of new careers programme,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/05/children-young-five-england-urged-think-about-careers

However, only negotiations on our dispute can avert the planned action this month and I urge the Prime Minister to show a renewed sense of urgency, grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses without further delay. “As for minimum staffing, last month’s action was safe for patients because of detailed discussions we chose to initiate with the NHS to protect emergency services and life-saving care. The public respected that and even ministers acknowledged our constructive approach. “Safe staffing levels that are set in law are what we want to see year-round not just in these extreme circumstances. “We’ve long campaigned for governments to be accountable for safe and effective staffing levels in NHS and social care to prevent one nurse being left with 15, 20 or even 25 sick patients. “The evidence is unequivocal – safe staffing saves lives and having the right number of registered nurses on duty has a direct impact on the safety and quality of patient care. Today’s highly unsafe situation is what is driving our members to say ‘enough is enough’.” Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect said: “This hollow invitation ignores the fact that a majority of public sector workers are not covered by a pay review body, including nearly all civil servants. We have been calling for years for this to be rectified, something which the Government has consistently ignored. “These workers have been some of the most harshly treated over the past decade of real-terms pay cuts, and now the Government is signalling its intent to leave them out once again. “Our members have already indicated their willingness to take industrial action and there is nothing in this announcement that will persuade us not to proceed to a formal ballot as planned.” Unison’s assistant general secretary Jon Richards said: “Ministers should focus their time and energy on rebuilding trust and relationships with workers, not silencing and suppressing them. “Minimum staffing levels in the NHS would be welcome by the public and health staff every single day of the week. That could avoid people being left lying in agony on A&E floors or dying in the backs of ambulances. “The NHS is on its knees because of record vacancies. The idea of limiting legal staffing levels to strike days and threatening to sack or fine health workers at such a time shows proper patient care isn’t ministers’ priority. “The Government is picking ill-advised fights with NHS employees and unions to mask years of dismal failure to tackle pay and staffing.” TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “This is an attack on the right to strike. It’s an attack on working people, and it’s an attack on one of our longstanding British liberties. “It means that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don’t. That’s wrong, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal. “The announcement offers nothing more to help with this year’s pay and the cost-of-living crisis. “The only offer of talks is for next year. But we need to resolve the current disputes and boost the pay of public sector workers now. “The Prime Minister said yesterday his door is always open – if he’s serious, he should prove it. He should take up my offer to get around the table to improve this year’s pay and end the current disputes. “There is a world of difference between promises of jam tomorrow with technical discussions about pay review bodies, and proper negotiations on pay in the here and now. “Our public services are already deep in a staffing crisis. But this Government has gone from clapping key workers to threating them with the sack if they take lawful action for a pay rise. It will only push more people away from essential jobs in public services, harming the whole nation.” Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said: “Just when you thought the Government could go no lower, ministers say they’re looking to deal with strikes by making them illegal, rather than negotiate with unions. “PCS members are on strike because they cannot afford the cost of living. We view any attempt to outlaw strikes as an attack on the trade union movement and we will resist that at every stage.” Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said: “This is an empty offer from the Tory government, and a meaningless stunt from Grant Shapps. “Firefighters and other key workers are facing a ‘real-terms’ pay cut, against a backdrop of rising food and fuel prices during the cost-of-living crisis. “Nothing in this statement from Grant Shapps seeks to address the ‘in work’ poverty faced by these workers who kept our public services going during the pandemic. “They were the Covid heroes. “This grandstanding from Grant Shapps is badly misjudging the public mood. “The Government should call off all pay cuts and we’ll call off strikes. “Grant Shapps should stop telling workers to accept falling real wages.” Claire Sullivan, director of employer relations and union services at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Imposing new anti-strike legislation in a country which already has some of the most onerous strike laws in Europe is unnecessary, weak and unworkable. “The Government is well aware that the proposed ‘voluntary agreements’ in the NHS are already in place due to health workers’ commitment to providing ‘critical to life’ cover. “The way for the Government to avoid current and future workplace disputes is through ongoing, meaningful dialogue and by working in partnership with trade unions. The CSP and other health unions have been warning of the developing NHS crisis for a decade and calling for urgent pay talks for several months, only to be met repeatedly by a complete block from Government.”",Government pressing ahead with ‘minimum safety levels’ legislation,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/unions-government-grant-shapps-nhs-prime-minister-b2256705.html

The official government forecasts from HM Treasury show a fall in UK economic output (gross domestic product, GDP) of 0.8 per cent in 2023. The Scottish Fiscal Commission are predicting a 1.2 per cent fall in Scottish economic output. There are no official forecasts for the Highland economy but it is very likely that the GDP performance will be even worse, with probably a fall of about 1.5 per cent. The reasons for that include the greater importance of the tourism industry. Inflation in 2023 is forecast to be about five per cent. That implies an annual fall in personal incomes of about 6.5 per cent in the Highlands. That means another substantial reduction in personal spending, which will have serious negative implications for local shops and other businesses. Looking further ahead, 2024 will almost certainly be better but there can be little doubt that 2023 will be another bad year for the local economy. The world economy had a very bad 2022 because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and an inflation rate exceeding 10 per cent. The huge increase in oil and gas prices has badly affected the output of many industries and also consumer spending. There is little expectation of an improvement until later in 2023, as the above forecasts show. The Highlands have a diversified economy, dominated by the service sector, including tourism in normal years. The manufacturing sector is relatively small but includes important industries such as offshore oil and gas production, renewable energy, Scotch whisky and fish processing. Public sector employment has held up well, because of the importance of bodies such as the Highland Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, NatureScot and the Crofting Commission. However, all their budgets have been under severe pressure and that will continue during 2023. Tourism is very important for many parts of the Highlands. It had a very bad 2022 and unfortunately there are few signs of a significant improvement in 2023. There were big falls in visitor numbers last year because of the various Covid restrictions, which resulted in similar falls in revenue for local hotels, B&Bs and many local shops. Hopefully there will be a revival during 2023. Some industries have done surprisingly well, such as Scotch whisky. New distilleries and expansions are currently under construction in various parts of the Highlands. It is a very strange time for the energy industry in the Highlands, including offshore oil and gas, wind farms and other renewables. Oil and gas production is declining steadily but the recent huge increases in world oil and gas prices have helped existing fields and will possibly lead to a few new developments, despite environmental opposition. In contrast, there has been disappointing progress with renewable energy developments and there are few reasons to expect 2023 to be better. A few local businesses, notably Global Energy at Nigg, are doing very well from wind farm contracts but the overall growth has been much less than predicted. The fishing industry should have a better year because of recent international agreements on fish catches. It and the local fish farms have also benefitted from the rises in consumer prices. Most other local businesses have been badly affected by the huge rises in energy prices. However, world oil and gas prices have fallen significantly in recent weeks. Consumer confidence is low and I expect that to continue during the first half of 2023 at least. The lower consumer spending will have negative impacts for shops and other service sector businesses. More closures seem inevitable. There can be little doubt that the first half of 2023 will be another bad time for the Highland economy. I hope there will be a big improvement during the second half of the year but the current indications are not promising. Tony Mackay is an Inverness-based economist.

Morris Leslie, the company behind the West Kinfauns plans, won planning permission in principle in August. 2022? The proposal is for a four-star, four-storey hotel as well as holiday lodges, transport museum and shops. Cafes, restaurants, bakeries and a cycle repair shops could also form part of the development, which could create up to 130 full-time jobs. Next steps in Perthshire leisure hub Morris Leslie’s group operations director Graham Ogilvie has revealed the next steps for the development. Reflecting on a year of progress, he said: “2022 has all been about getting the consent. 2023 is working through the consent and splitting the development into different parts. “The lodges will be the first part of the development. We will progress with the applying for detailed consent and then construction will commence. “This is something we will do ourselves. In the past 18 months we have created our first holiday park at Alyth. This would also be done under the Morris Leslie Villages banner. “It will be around 50 lodges on site. This part of the project alone would be an investment of around £10 million.” Hotel operator sought Morris Leslie is best known for hiring construction equipment, but also has auction and property interests. It also has its headquarters on the site it acquired from Edrington in 2019. However, the company is not going to be a hotel operator. Armed with the outline planning permission from Perth and Kinross Council it will be marketing the hotel opportunity. “There have been discussions with operators that are ongoing,” Mr Ogilvie said. “Getting the brand is the easier bit, it’s the funding and development of the construction project where there are negotiations and discussions ongoing. “I’d like to think we’ll have an operator on board in 12 months’ time.” He warns that the quoted £33.8 million cost is likely to be far higher due to inflation. “The build costs from when we started the project to where we are now have moved significantly but room rates for hotels have moved higher as well,” he said. The park and ride facility, museum and retail elements of the project are likely to come at the later stages of the development. Neighbouring the site is a new 15-home development by Ogilvie Homes who won permission on appeal to the Scottish Government. Morris Leslie hopes around 80,000 people a year could be attracted to the site, boosting the local economy by £4m.

Comment No one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are The dysfunctional rail system can only be fixed if rail pensions are also sorted out John Ralfe 6 January 2023 • 9:35am 350,000 people are part of the Railways Pension Scheme Credit: Jacob King/PA Wire New Year, new rail strikes, new chaos for rail passengers. Although unions have been locked in a bitter dispute with government and rail companies for months, over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions, we haven’t heard much about pensions. Perhaps this is because no one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are? Pensions for train operating company staff are still based on final salary, and most still have a retirement age of 60. Even public sector pensions are now based on career average salaries, with a higher retirement age. The average salary for a train driver with 10-20 years experience is reported to be £55,000, so a driver retiring at 60 with 30 years pension would get an average inflation-linked pension of £22,000, plus a £33,000 cash lump sum. Train company accounts show the annual cost of new pension promises is around 60pc of salary – a huge part of overall pay – even after employee contributions. Rail pensions have a unique “cost sharing” arrangement, with all regular and deficit cash contributions split 60/40 between employers and employees, which may explain the reluctance to increase annual cash contributions. Each train operating company is part of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), set up at privatisation in 1994. It is an industry-wide scheme with over 100 legally separate sections, including Network Rail, and freight, engineering and maintenance companies. At privatisation, all pensioners and deferred members were transferred to a new section with a “crown guarantee” underwritten by taxpayers. RPS is one of the UK’s largest pension schemes, with £37bn of assets at December 2021, and 350,000 members, including 100,000 current employees. Each RPS section has a three-year valuation but the December 2016 valuation for train operating companies have still not been agreed with the Pensions Regulator, way, way beyond the legal deadline. Although the established rail franchising rules mean train operating companies must pay cash contributions over the life of a franchise, they have no liability for a deficit when the franchise ends. The deficit is simply passed on to the next company taking over the franchise, in a game of pass-the-parcel. If no one is prepared to take on the franchise, it reverts to the Government. The latest accounts for each of the train operating companies show the combined pension deficit is around £8bn. We know the effective re-nationalisation of the train operators in 2020 means all the industry’s annual losses are paid by taxpayers. But re-nationalisation also means taxpayers are on the hook for the pension deficit, which has been hidden from taxpayers. The dysfunctional rail system can only be sorted out if rail pensions are also sorted out. Despite the threat of further strikes, this means closing the expensive and risky defined benefit pension and moving to defined contribution. The good news for rail staff is that some of the cost savings can be used to increase monthly pay. Defined contributions would still leave the £8bn deficit to be paid, partly through higher fares, but with taxpayers left picking up most of the bill.

The British Medical Association (BMA) warned of three days of further disruption for the NHS if health secretary Steve Barclay continues to refuse to negotiate over pay demands. It comes ahead of a ballot opening on 9 January, when 45,000 junior doctors in England will be asked whether they want to strike in the row over pay. The BMA claimed that Mr Barclay was making attempts to find a negotiated settlement impossible by ignoring “all calls and letters” despite the prospect of strike action. “Pay erosion, exhaustion and despair are forcing junior doctors out of the NHS, pushing waiting lists even higher as patients suffer needlessly,” said Dr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Robert Laurenson, co-chairs of the BMA junior doctors committee. They added: “The government’s refusal to address fifteen years of pay erosion has given junior doctors no choice but to ballot for industrial action. If the government won’t fight for our health service, then we will.” The union said successive governments have overseen 15 years of real-term pay cuts for junior doctors, saying it amounted to a “staggering and unjustifiable” 26.1 per cent decline in pay since 2008-09. But the government has awarded only a 2 per cent pay rise for junior doctors, and Mr Barclay has continued to point to the recommendation of the independent pay review body as a reason to avoid negotiations. The BMA said it was “particularly galling” to see Rishi Sunak and his ministers refer to the pay review body. “The reality is that the doctors’ pay review body has been constrained by political interference for more than a decade,” said the union’s co-chairs. The prospect of fresh NHS disruption comes as ambulance staff prepare to walk out on 11 and 23 January, while nurses will strike again for two consecutive days on 18 and 19 January. The government has vowed to press ahead with plans to introduce new legislation to enforce “minimum safety levels” in the NHS and five other key sectors during industrial action. Health unions reacted with fury to the move, saying it would do nothing to resolve the disputes breaking out across the country. The Royal College of Nursing, GMB and Unison – leading the walks-outs planned for nurses and ambulance staff later in January – also vowed to opposed “desperate” anti-strike legislation. The government also urged union leaders to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about public sector pay settlements for 2023-24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged strikes. But unions bosses said ministers must engage on pay demands for the current year, with the GMB health union accusing the government of trying to “kick the can down the road”. The BMA and other health bodies have warned of an “exodus” of NHS staff as industrial dispute rumbles on. Four in ten (40 per cent) of junior doctors plan to leave the health service as soon as they can find another role, a survey carried out by the BMA last month found. Low pay and poor working conditions were the main reasons cited for wanting to leave, with the union warning that the NHS “would not be able to cope” without two-fifths of its junior doctor workforce. It comes after Mr Barclay appeared to blame high numbers of flu, Covid and Strep A cases for the particular pressures the NHS faced over Christmas – a claim refuted by health leaders who pointed to long-term struggles. Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA’s consultants committee, said the government’s refusal to admit that the NHS is in a state crisis was “simply delusional”.",Junior doctors to vote on plans to hold three-day strike in row over pay,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/junior-doctors-strike-nhs-march-b2256855.html

The latest S&P Global/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI), closely watched by the housebuilding sector, scored 48.8 in December, down from 50.4 in November. Any score below 50 indicates that construction sector output has shrunk, and December’s score marks the first contraction since August. It also came in broadly in line with the consensus, with analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics predicting PMI would fall to around 48.5. The sector has suffered the knock-on effects of a slowing housing market, with mortgages becoming more expensive for home buyers resulting in fewer house sales, economists said. Yet construction firms continue to face higher inflation, pushing up the cost of raw materials and transportation, and the looming threat of a recession. As a result, builders are feeling downbeat about the future of their businesses, the survey revealed. December saw confidence among businesses in the outlook for the year drop into negative territory for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and for only the sixth time on record. Dr John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: “The construction sector was stuck in the mud in December with the steepest fall in activity since the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020 and a similarly fast drop in pipelines of new work. “Housebuilding saw a notable change of direction, with a mix of higher inflation for raw materials and transportation and the squeeze on affordability rates for mortgages resulting in fewer house sales.” The commercial sector marked a “bright spot” in the survey, with activity growing fractionally, with a score of 50.3. But it was offset by contractions across the residential and civil engineering sectors in December. Dr Glen added: “Civil engineering, responsible for larger projects, continued to be the weakest performer again, with a sixth month in the doldrums as uncertainty about the UK economy reared its ugly head again and customers hesitated.” Furthermore, the survey suggests that builders are reining back on recruitment amid a hesitancy to spend too much when the future of the economy is uncertain. Employment fell below a score of 50 for the first time since January 2021, with weak sales meaning that vacancies are often not being filled, the survey indicated. Dr Glen said: “Builders are fast running out of the resilient spirit maintained over the last couple of years as the blocks to success piled up and the winter of discontent with high inflation, strikes and shortages continues.” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The construction sector managed to keep its head above water through the autumn, but now is being dragged down by the recession in the wider economy and the surge in borrowing costs faced by households and businesses.” But he pointed out that a drop in activity in December may have been partially driven by some builders “downing tools” during the week of heavy snow across parts of the UK.",Builders deflated as construction sector shrinks,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/builders-deflated-as-construction-sector-shrinks-b2257249.html

Speaking on a visit to a school in Battersea, south-west London, the Prime Minister said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday.” Pressed whether the talks would include discussions on this year’s pay, the Prime Minister did not rule this out, saying: “What we have said is we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation with all union leaders about what is responsible, what is reasonable, and what is affordable for our country when it comes to pay. “I’m hopeful that those talks can be constructive and we can find a way through this.” Asked whether he could meet the nursing union’s demands “halfway” after it suggested a pay rise of ten per cent rather than nearly double, the PM added: “We have always been clear that we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation, a two way conversation with union leaders.” The Standard understands that the move is a new approach by the Government, with Cabinet ministers, not the PM, meeting the unions that their departments work with, and that the Government aims to talk about pay deals for 2023/24 rather than this year. However, the stand-off between the Government and unions has escalated after ministers proposed bringing in legislation to force some sectors such as health and transport to continue delivering a “minimum service” during industrial action. Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation. Asked a second time whether people could be sacked for not going to work under the new law, the premier said: ""I fully believe in the unions' role in our society and the freedom for them to strike. ""I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption. ""That's why we're going to bring forward new laws, in common with countries like France, Italy, Spain and others, that ensure that we have minimum levels of safety in critical areas like fire, like ambulance, so that even when strikes are going on you know that your health will be protected. ""I think that's entirely reasonable and that's what our new laws will do."" Labour has said it would repeal the “minimum service” laws, if they are passed before the General Election, and if it wins the poll expected next year.

The Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure vital public services maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike.

Speaking from the picket line at Euston station on Friday, Mr Lynch told BBC Breakfast that the Government is trying to “close down” the unions with the new legislation. “What this is a symbol of is that the Government are losing the argument,” he said. “They’ve lost the argument on austerity and pay, and the state of our national public services. “And instead they want to close that argument down by closing down the unions and stopping us from campaigning against poverty.” He said the Bill is a threat to sack union members if they refuse to go to work. “What they are saying is that they will sack our members if they don’t go to work,” he said. “They are going to conscript our members. “We have to name who will go to work, and if those members in a lawful manner don’t want to cross our picket line they can be dismissed individually and the union can be fined. “So we will have to see what the law says.” It comes as services have been crippled by the walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) at Network Rail and 14 train operators on Friday.

Mr Sunak said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday. “We incredibly value the important work that our public sector workers do, especially our nurses, and we want to have an honest, grown-up conversation about what’s affordable, what’s responsible for the country. “Those invitations have gone out and I’m hopeful that those meetings can happen on Monday so we can have a productive conversation and find a way through this.” Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation.

As many projects were pushed back last year, the beginning of 2023 will be marked by a steady pipeline of work. However, this optimism will be short-lived. Recessionary forces will strike and work is expected to tail off at the back end of 2023. No one feels confident. It is a nervous period to operate as a business, and the sector must stay alert. For the housing market, demand is falling amidst the cost of living crisis, job insecurity and the recession. Declining property prices should stabilise by Spring 2023 yet only those not bound to the difficulties of securing a mortgage or with sufficient savings will be able to afford the luxury of entering the property ladder. The government could help stimulate demand in the housing market by introducing a reduced stamp duty rate for first-time buyers and those wanting to downsize to a smaller property. Confidence in the market will return, but it will take time. Ultimately while the best-run construction companies will survive, partly due to their inherent financial strength, others, including good contractors who may be dependent on third parties, will unfortunately fail. The recession and cost of the living crisis will continue to bite hard. The sector must brace itself for a challenging and uncertain 2023.","UK building sector activity falls, as house prices drop again; eurozone inflation down – business live",https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jan/06/uk-house-prices-fall-us-jobs-eurozone-inflation-train-strikes-business-live

Sean Harrison, managing director of Harrison Developments said: “These new deals are a tremendous vindication of the substantial investment we have made in our park. “More than 350 new and sustainable jobs have been created on site, which makes us very proud. The wide variety of successful businesses here is also an indication of the strength of the economy in the Ryedale area.

We have been delighted to accommodate their needs, as they have outgrown their current buildings. “These are not the easiest of times, as we emerge from a global pandemic into a worrying cost of living crisis, but the current level of activity at our park gives us confidence for the future,” said Mr Harrison. Luke Counter, owner of the multi-award-winning Counter Interiors, which now occupies a new 1,500 sq ft mezzanine showroom, said: “I can’t speak highly enough of the Malton Enterprise Park, which is the perfect base for us. The flexibility of the mezzanine unit which we occupy means that we now have an extensive showroom, storeroom and offices. “We are based in Clifton in York, but quite a few of our customers are from the Malton and Ryedale area, so it made sense for us to open another showroom here. The location, just by the A64, is ideal, with easy access to the rest of the county. The whole park looks magnificent, which creates the perfect atmosphere for businesses here to flourish.” Meanwhile Bella di Notte, the popular women’s fashion retailer, which originally moved to the Malton Enterprise Park four years ago, has recently taken extra space to accommodate its growth.

Just this week, Amazon said it was axing 18,000 workers, or 6% of its office staff, while business software firm Salesforce said it would reduce its workforce by 10%, or roughly 8,000 people. That followed announcements from dozens of other firms including big names such as Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, hardware heavyweight Cisco, and payments firm Stripe. Despite the belt-tightening seen in Silicon Valley, the world's largest economy soldiers on. Employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, according to the latest official figures. Although that was slower than gains seen in 2021, when activity roared back to life after the pandemic, it was still strong by most standards. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, returning to historic lows. The economy is widely predicted to slow in the coming months as rising prices weigh on consumer spending. Firms are also grappling with higher borrowing costs after the US central bank hiked rates rapidly last year. So are the cuts in the tech industry a warning sign for others? ""I don't think people should be worried,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. ""What we're seeing right now seems to be... a correction, not the start of an ominous, systematic recession."" Many tech executives making the announcements have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic, when more activity moved online and business boomed. Funding for smaller start-ups has also dried up due to higher interest rates and the sharp downturn in the US stock market in 2022. Big hits some firms have taken from the meltdown in the crypto sector have not helped the mood either. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM, said the wave of tech cuts represented a ""necessary and expected"" adjustment after a generation of rapid growth, fuelled in part by low interest rates, which culminated in the pandemic frenzy. ""An era of excess has come to an end,"" he said. ""Firms and individuals should be prepared to reset expectations about growth, employment and investment across what continues to be a very solid industry."" He suggested that tech firms will no longer be insulated from ups and downs in the wider economy, including the expected downturns in Europe and the UK this year. But he added that the job losses should not be ""over-interpreted"", noting that many of the workers affected, at least in the US, appear to be finding new jobs quickly. The latest jobs report from the Labor Department showed that payrolls in the information sector - which includes much of the tech industry - shrank by just 5,000 from November to December. That's despite thousands of job cuts being announced in recent months and compared to a year ago, employment is up. ""It's probably a canary in the coal mine for the global economy more than it is for the American economy,"" he added, noting that many of the tech cuts have hit foreign staff. Last week, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that a third of the world would likely be in recession in 2023. That will hurt tech firms, many of which do big business overseas. But for now, the US labour market has remained unexpectedly resilient, making some hopeful that the country will be able to fend off a harsh downturn, despite the central bank raising interest rates to try to cool the economy and price rises. Nearly every sector in the US economy added jobs last month, with bars and restaurants, health care firms and construction businesses helping to drive the gains. Although job losses are rising - especially in sectors vulnerable to higher interest rates like housing, banking and tech - the figures overall remained near historic lows last year, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has been tracking such announcements since the 1990s. ""We are seeing the labour market cooling,"" he says. ""It's a slowdown but I don't think I could say at this point whether or not it's a panic situation."" Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, said he worries many of the layoff announcements reflect peer pressure, as executives feel compelled to copy other firms making cuts - even as they continue to churn out healthy profits. If that sentiment spreads, as he expects, it risks turning the forecasts of economic hardship into reality. ""Companies do what other companies do,"" he said. ""This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because if everybody lays somebody off, the unemployment rate will go up and we will in fact have a worse economy.""",Are tech job cuts a warning for the wider economy?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64189106?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Rebecca Morelle,85546280,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F74F/production/_128211336_virgin-orbit-88.jpg,en,2023-01-07 04:12:22,-0.019,GB,"The first-ever orbital rocket launch from British soil is set to blast off on Monday, marking the start of the UK's race to space. The ambition is to turn the country into a global player in space - from manufacturing satellites, to building rockets and creating new spaceports. But can the UK carve out a place in an increasingly crowded market - and why try to reach for the stars? ""We are the guinea pigs,"" says Melissa Thorpe. ""It is the first time any of us have done this, so it's been quite a learning experience."" Melissa is in charge of Spaceport Cornwall, which is about to attempt its very first foray into space. She's showing me around their base at Newquay Airport. There's all the usual hubbub of activity: passengers arriving, suitcases being loaded, planes being fuelled. But there's also something more surprising on the tarmac: a 21m-long rocket. A team is busy prepping it for the first ever launch from UK soil that will take satellites into orbit around the Earth. But this is a blast off with a difference. There won't be a vertical launch from the ground. Instead, the rocket is fixed underneath the wing of a modified jumbo jet. Once the plane is mid-air, the rocket will be released and fire its engines to head into space. Setting up the UK's first spaceport has taken years and a lot of hard work, plus an entirely new regulatory framework to ensure these launches are safe. The hope is it will make a difference to the local area, one of the poorest in the UK, by bringing in new companies and creating new jobs. ""I think it's the next chapter for Cornwall,"" Melissa says. ""We were at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. We're not new to pioneering technologies."" But there's a wider ambition too. If this succeeds, it should help to position the UK as a leading place for space. However, this isn't the first attempt at creating a British launch industry. A white and red rocket, nicknamed ""the lipstick"", was supposed to be the start of something big for the UK. It blasted off in 1971, sending a satellite into space. The programme was called Black Arrow, and this was the first British-built rocket to deliver a British-built satellite into orbit - although it took off from Australia. But the costs were deemed too high by the government, so that first launch turned out to be the last. The UK's launch industry hit a long pause after this, but another aspect did take off in Britain - satellite building. And this has helped to drive a thriving space sector, which, according to a recent government report, is worth £16.5bn a year to the UK economy and employs nearly 50,000 people. ""We absolutely knock it out of the park when it comes to small satellite manufacture,"" says Dr Alice Bunn, CEO of UKSpace, the trade association of British space companies. Until now, she says, satellites built in the UK have had to be shipped abroad to get into space, but this first launch will change that. And it comes at a time when satellites have become integral to our lives - although Alice says most people are unaware of how dependent we are on this technology. ""Think about satellite navigation systems, environmental monitoring, emergency response - let alone all the telecommunications capability - that we can provide from space. It really is a running thread through our lives,"" she says. And some companies have big plans with this technology. The Cardiff-based company Space Forge thinks a whole host of new materials can be made in orbit. In a cleanroom, one of their small satellites is being painstakingly prepared for its journey. It's one of nine being sent into space by the Cornwall launch. Space Forge describe their shoe box-sized satellites as mini factories. ""In space, with the absence of gravity, you can mix together any different materials you want,"" says Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bacon. ""So if you take the whole periodic table, and start putting things together - like lead, aluminium, rubidium, einsteinium - there are billions of new alloys that you can now make that you couldn't make on Earth."" The new materials could be used in electric vehicles, green technology or computing, he explains. And he thinks there are some big advantages to launching these satellites close to their Welsh base. ''The fact that we can just drive down the road for a couple hours to get to our spaceport is a huge impact,"" Andrew says. But it's not just Cornwall racing to space. Amidst the bleakly beautiful undulating hills and jagged cliffs of the Shetland island of Unst, there's a hive of activity as diggers and dumper trucks come and go. The team here is celebrating because an important milestone has been reached. The concrete is setting on their first launch pad, one of three planned at the site. The SaxaVord Spaceport is being constructed on a peninsula jutting out into the sea, at the northernmost tip of the UK. ""I think the first response from the locals was that maybe it was an April Fool or something like that,"" says Debbie Strang, SaxaVord's chief operating officer. ""And then, as they've seen the progress and the development, there's been real excitement about what we've been doing."" There's a good reason why they've chosen such a remote place, where sheep and Shetland ponies outnumber the inhabitants. ""It's the safety element for us,"" says Debbie. ""What we're doing needs to be as far away as possible from population centres, so that when the rocket leaves, there's no real danger to people nearby."" SaxaVord is aiming for the UK's first vertical rocket launch to take satellites into orbit, with up to 30 launches a year once it's fully up and running. It's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland. Others are planned in Sutherland in the Highlands and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. The hope is that these could all boost local economies, and that's especially important in Unst. ""This island's suffered quite badly from depopulation over the last 20 or 30 years,"" explains Scott Hammond, the deputy CEO of SaxaVord. ""There was a small airfield here that used to be the third busiest heliport in the UK. And then they also had an RAF station here. ""When that left, it halved the population of the island and it clearly had a massive economic impact."" He hopes the spaceport could give the island a boost. ""We'll have more and more service jobs, during the fuelling of the rockets, for example, putting the liquid oxygen into the rockets. And those of course, will be highly paid, highly skilled jobs."" But if you're building a launchpad, you also need rockets - and SaxaVord is working with several companies looking to use Unst to blast off. One of these is Skyrora, based in Cumbernauld, just outside of Glasgow. Inside their vast hanger, the team is busy working on different rocket parts, from nose cones, to engines and containers for propellants. The company is making smaller prototypes, before building a larger rocket, Skyrora XL, that they plan to eventually launch from the Shetland Islands. ""You do a full design on paper and then you start building it. You build prototypes, you do tests, you go back to the drawing board and see what needs to be fixed,"" says Ahsan Zaman. He's just finished his aerospace degree, and says the new push for space in the UK is opening up opportunities for science and engineering graduates. He's proud to be working on the project. ""If we're successful, then we'll forever be known as the first people to do it in the UK. So yeah, it is an honour as well as exciting."" While the launch industry is just starting to come together in the UK, it's much better established in other parts of the world. And one company in particular now dominates the market: Elon Musk's SpaceX. With their reusable rockets, the company has massively cut the price of sending satellites into space. Can the raft of small new rocket companies compete? Skyrora's CEO Volodymyr Levykin says he wants his rockets to offer a more bespoke service. ""We want to be like a satellite taxi service,"" he explains. ""To launch whenever the customer wants us to launch and deliver them to an exact position they need to be in orbit."" He thinks because more and more small satellites are being built, the market to launch them will grow - but not every company will make it. ""Some of us, of course, will fail,"" he says. ""But there are some who are believers in this emerging market. And we decided to invest earlier rather than later, to be ready when the market actually will start to boom."" The UK government says it wants to push the space sector, and is investing in research and development. But UKSpace's Alice Bunn says the support needs to be long term. ""You will not become a global space player by investing in research and development alone. There has to be some kind of government commitment to ongoing operational capability."" She says this could mean the government signing up as a customer for launches, for example. ""We need to think a little bit creatively, industry and government working together, just to get us off the ground here."" All eyes are now on Cornwall, waiting for the first UK launch to blast off. It will be just the start for this new industry and there will be many challenges ahead. But as the well-known mantra goes, space is hard - and anyone working in this sector knows this. The hope is that with this high risk, comes the possibility of sky-high rewards. Follow Rebecca on Twitter.

In a sign of the scale of the problems facing the NHS, Rishi Sunak will spend Saturday focusing on how to ease the pressure on frontline services. But Mr Sunak has been warned that the rare weekend meeting is unlikely to reverse the NHS’ fortunes, which have been blamed on “years of inaction”. Senior doctors say the NHS is on a knife edge, with many A&E units struggling to keep up with demand and trusts and ambulance services declaring critical incidents. Discharge rates fell to a new low in England last week, with only a third of those patients ready to be released from hospital actually leaving. Mr Sunak, during a visit to a school on Friday, said he recognised that the NHS was “under enormous pressure”. No 10’s NHS Recovery Forum will see the Prime Minister hold talks with health experts about how to improve performance. Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Treasury minister John Glen, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden and the chief executive officer of NHS England Amanda Pritchard are also set to attend. The focus will be on four crucial issues: social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care, and primary care. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there were “no silver bullets” to solving the crisis currently being experienced at hospitals and other care centres. “This crisis has been a decade or more in the making and we are now paying the high price for years of inaction and managed decline,” said Mr Taylor. “Patients are experiencing delays that we haven’t seen for years. “High levels of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rising Covid levels are exacerbating the problem but the cause is decades of under-investment in staffing, capital and the lack of a long-term solution to the capacity-crunch facing social care. “None of these problems can be solved tomorrow.” The Prime Minister, in his first speech of 2023 on Wednesday, made reducing NHS waiting lists one of his key pledges before the next election, which is due to take place before 2025. Saturday’s Downing Street forum is expected to last most of the day. As well as ministers, attendees will include chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations, local areas and councils from across the country. Clinical experts from Royal Colleges and independent sector organisations working with health and social care services to deliver services for patients are also expected to join the Prime Minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “As the Prime Minister made clear this week, easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS is one of his key promises. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting branded the meeting a “talking shop”. The senior Labour figure said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor, a former Labour and Tony Blair aide, agreed with the criticism, saying the investment to improve discharge rates came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. He added: “Indeed, some local systems are still awaiting their allocation. “Any similar funding next year must be provided four to six months in advance so it can genuinely ease winter pressures.” On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet with union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year. However, Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen has told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” over the current settlement to prevent planned strikes. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll, of course, go to the meeting and make the case for nursing in all forums, but it’s sadly not what’s going to prevent strike action that’s planned for 10 days’ time. “I have put out an olive branch to get us to the table, I’m asking the Prime Minister now to meet the RCN halfway. The ball is firmly in the Prime Minister’s court.” A Department of Health and Social Care source said the Health Secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”.",Sunak to hold emergency No 10 talks in bid to ease winter care crisis,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/steve-barclay-matthew-taylor-nhs-wes-streeting-prime-minister-b2257731.html

A Downing Street spokeswoman said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she said. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor said the investment came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year in talks that are unlikely to avert planned strikes. Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” to prevent industrial action. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll of course go to the meeting and make the case for nursing in all forums, but it’s sadly not what’s going to prevent strike action that’s planned for 10 days’ time. “I have put out an olive branch to get us to the table, I’m asking the Prime Minister now to meet the RCN halfway. The ball is firmly in the Prime Minister’s court.” A Department of Health and Social Care source said the Health Secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”.",Rishi Sunak holding emergency talks in bid to ease winter NHS crisis,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nhs-rishi-sunak-chris-whitty-steve-barclay-prime-minister-b2257800.html

The prime minister told health and social care leaders during an emergency summit in Downing Street on Saturday that it was a “collective responsibility” to free up hospital beds and slash ambulance waiting times. But Ms Cullen said his pledge will fail unless he gives her members a pay rise. She warned Mr Sunak the public would back nurses over the government if any were sacked as part of a new anti-strike crackdown and claimed the upcoming nurses’ walkout will be the biggest strike of its kind in the world. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Cullen also challenged the “out of touch” prime minister and health secretary Steve Barclay to work a 14-hour shift in a crisis-hit emergency ward. She said Mr Sunak could end the strikes this week if he takes up her offer to meet in the middle on pay, after saying she was willing to discuss a raise of 10 per cent instead of the 19 per cent originally asked for. During the crunch summit to solve the chaos engulfing English hospitals, Mr Sunak warned health leaders “business-as-usual mindset won’t fix the challenges we face”. England’s chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty and NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard were among those summoned for the rare weekend meeting. The prime minister is understood to be looking at ideas including the use of technology to help people stay out of hospital and increasing the number of “virtual wards”. He also highlighted that a small number of NHS trusts were responsible for a large proportion of serious issues, including long ambulance waits and waiting times for cancer care. Downing Street has said it will publish recovery plans to improve ambulance and A&E waiting times “in the coming weeks”. As Mr Sunak battles to bring the current crisis under control, Ms Cullen urged him to understand the scale of the upcoming nurses’ strike. A 48-hour walkout in England from 18 January will involve more hospitals than similar strikes last month’s action. She said: “We balloted around 320,000 nursing staff and my understanding is it has been the largest ballot of nursing staff in the world and it is the largest nursing strike in the world. We’ve also increased the number of organisations [such as NHS Trusts]. There are now 70 involved. First time around it was 46.” She also revealed that she had received messages of support from senior politicians in several European countries. December’s strikes were headline news in France, Italy, Spain and Austria among others. The world was “watching in dismay”, Ms Cullen said. She urged Mr Sunak to learn from the experience of other international leaders who were forced to back down in the face of ward walkouts, including Irish prime ministers in the first decade of this century. “What this government should look to is how the leader of [Ireland] stepped in very quickly and did not allow both of those strikes to go beyond the first few days,” she said. “And took immediate action. And that was because the public pressure was enormous.” On Wednesday, Mr Sunak set out his vision for the NHS, including a personal pledge to cut waiting lists. But he was criticised for offering nothing to end the current crisis or the strikes, which will also see ambulance staff take action later this month. “He made a broad, bold statement that he was going to cut waiting lists, but he won’t unless he addresses the crisis in nursing ... and the only way you are going to do that is to address the fundamental issue of nurses’ pay,” Ms Cullen said. Strike action will have to escalate if the government continues to ignore nurses, she said, although no decisions have yet been taken on what that would look like. Ms Cullen added: “He could bring it to a resolution this coming week – and avert industrial action. I will make myself available any night or any day. Let’s get round a table. Let’s have a discussion. “I think they owe that to the profession, to all those 320,000 nurses. And they owe it to every patient in this country, particularly those 7.2 million sitting on waiting lists year on year, to get around a table.” On Friday Mr Sunak refused to rule out that nurses could be sacked as part of his new crackdown, swerving the question in a broadcast interview. She described “any suggestion that they would sack any nurse… simply because nurses are standing up for their patients and the NHS” as “disheartening” given that there were currently 47,000 vacancies in the UK. Describing the prime minister as “out of touch” with the realities of the current crisis, she challenged Mr Sunak and his health secretary to work a 14-hour shift in an emergency department. She said: “From 7am to late into the evening, when a number of those hours will be unpaid, when the nurses should be off shift and home but they have no one to hand their patients on to. “They need to just walk in the shoes of those nurses for a few of those shifts. And I think that would make better decisions.” Leaving the NHS Recovery Forum on Saturday, consultant physician James Dunbar told reporters he was “confident that action will be taken” to address the crisis – but not optimistic it would be dealt with before spring. “These are difficult problems to fix though, so I think it’s unlikely we’ll have it sorted by the end of this winter,” he said. Dr Dunbar said that “a lot of” senior clinical leaders taking part were “saying the same thing”, adding: “The prime minister seemed to understand that.” Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Adrian Boyle meanwhile said the crisis is “fixable” and welcomed emergency care being “recognised as a priority”. A Downing Street spokesperson said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she added. A Department of Health and Social Care source said the health secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”. A government spokesperson said: “The health and social care secretary wants to have an honest conversation with unions, including the RCN, about what is affordable in pay settlements for next year during these challenging times, and is keen to meet for discussions as soon as possible. “We have accepted the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in full and have given over 1 million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. This is on top of a 3 per cent pay increase last year when public sector pay was frozen and wider government support with the cost of living.”",Rishi Sunak warned waiting list pledge will fail without NHS pay rise as he calls for ‘radical’ action,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/pat-cullen-nurses-rcn-strikes-b2257639.html

Here, we speak to just three of them. Volunteers at a vital community foodbank say that demand is surging with low-paid workers increasing reliant on it to make ends meet, writes Russell Blackstock. The facility at St Gregory’s Catholic Church, in Wyndford, Glasgow, is staffed entirely by unpaid helpers and is open five days a week. Unlike other foodbanks, St Gregory’s does not require users to provide a referral from an agency. It distributes free bags comprising up to 20 items including cereal, pasta, canned soup, tuna, tinned fruit, long-life milk and eggs. Toiletries, washing powder and washing-up liquid are also available. Co-ordinator Eileen Low said the number of people seeking help had soared by more than 30% since the pandemic’s peak while in the week before Christmas volunteers distributed a record number of bags. “We have just had our biggest ever week with 219 basic bags being handed out to help more than 500 individuals and families,” she said. “It is a grim new record to end the year with for us.” Low said that the foodbank’s clientele had also changed since the cost of living crisis started to bite this winter and many more working families were now seeking help. “When we started out five years ago, we were distributing between 30 and 40 bags weekly and it was usually to the most vulnerable people such as refugees, single pensioners and those with mental health or addiction issues,” she explained. “But now we are seeing more and more parents who have low-paid jobs such as cleaners and hospitality workers coming to us for help because they can’t pay the bills and feed their kids at the same time. “The working poor is a growing sector in our area and the government seems unable to do something constructive about it, so that’s where community-based charities come in. We are another safety net for people who are struggling financially and the authorities seem happy to let the likes of us pick up the slack. “It is obscene that this is happening in this day in age. At times we feel as though we are providing a new frontline service.” Ingrid Mitchell, who lives locally, has been volunteering at St Gregory’s for the past three years. She helps to shop for staples and hands out and delivers bags to foodbank users. The mother of two is a senior cabin crew member with a large airline, serving meals and drinks to passengers on transatlantic routes. She has been shocked by the surge in families seeking assistance from the foodbank. She said: “Many people feel embarrassed to ask for help but some have no other choice and they now rely on us. I have always been community minded and it is awful to see ordinary people in this situation. Sadly, I can’t see this crisis easing any time soon.” ‘We are warm and can offer a respite to what is going on’ No longer just a place to borrow books or study for exams, libraries are introducing a range of activities, clubs and groups to create “warm and welcoming spaces” that people can utilise during the cost of living crisis, writes Alice Hinds. From movie matinees and craft groups to mindful colouring-in sessions for adults and regular coffee mornings, library leaders say such innovative services provide a vital lifeline for people in the community who would otherwise struggle to find warm, comfortable and, importantly, free places to spend time during winter months. Ray Pattie, library adviser at Edinburgh Central Library, says the centres have always provided support for communities but new groups have become increasingly popular for people who may feel isolated or worried about spending money while socialising. “Our users see libraries as safe and reliable spaces,” he explained. “People just don’t have the disposable income now for sitting in Costa for hours and hours – that can turn into an expensive week, so they are looking for other things to do outside of the home. “That’s why we’re providing things like Knit And Natter, a weekly craft group, and adult colouring-in sessions, too. “The activities give people an opportunity to still come out and spend time with other people in a warm space but it’s more affordable than visiting a cafe. It’s an opportunity to meet new people as well. Since I’ve worked in libraries, it has very much been all about the community.” As well as introducing social groups, many of the Scottish capital’s libraries have also added social spaces to encourage people to visit for as long as they like. Replicating a living room with plants, comfortable seating, warm lighting and coffee tables, the areas also have free-to-use jigsaws and board games and a number of libraries have also included self-help guides on topics such as energy and money saving, and cooking on a budget. Hana Mackechnie, lifelong learning service manager for libraries in Edinburgh, said: “Some of our libraries are open 52 hours a week and you don’t need to come for a particular reason. “We’re finding that people want a space where they can spend a little bit longer, and somewhere they can also find signposting to benefits they might be entitled to, or get advice on how to access particular services. If you are a reader, you probably already feel like you’re welcome in a library but there’s so much more going on and we’re trying to introduce more activities.” Every weekday during winter, libraries across Edinburgh are also hosting movie matinees with free teas, coffees and refreshments, giving people another way to keep warm for a few hours. Acting library supervisor Natasha Gibson added: “We were already providing or about to introduce these initiatives but the situation now has brought more of a need for them and highlighted just how valuable they are for the community. “People are becoming more aware that, yes, libraries are also a place to come and be social and have a few minutes of respite from whatever is going on in life. “People do come to the library specifically to chat to people or get a change of scenery and at the moment it’s a much-needed place away from home that’s warm – both in terms of the physical surroundings and the people that are here.” ‘It is sad to see so many people struggling’ Demand for free furniture, school uniforms and even haircuts is on the rise at a community-based initiative in south-west Scotland, writes Russell Blackstock. The Furniture Project in Stranraer was originally set up to recycle, repair and provide refurbished household goods at affordable prices. But the charity, which has more than 20 volunteers and runs two shops, has also turned to providing household items and services for free to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. “We started running Freebie Friday events that are proving to be hugely popular,” said boss Paul Smith. “These include giving away items like furniture and household appliances and demand has been high. “So many low-income workers who wouldn’t normally be struggling are now coming to us because the price of everything has risen so much that they simply can’t make ends meet. “I suppose we are doing what the likes of parish organisations and local authorities might have done in the past.” Other popular services provided by the charity include organising free school uniforms and haircuts for children whose parents are struggling to get by. “A new school blazer alone can cost between £40 and £50 and if you have three kids in the house, that is a big expense for any family,” said Smith. “People can come to our shop and discreetly get a school uniform for nothing, and we run this service all through the school year. We have also started a project involving local hairdressers so that kids can get haircuts for free because, again, this can be expensive if you have a number of children in the house. “We try to help to make sure that these kids don’t feel any different from friends at school who come from better-off backgrounds. “It is sad to see so many people struggling financially at the moment but I grew up on a housing scheme that was regarded as being poor and we had to put up with hand-me-downs, so I know what that is like.” The organisation also recycles bicycles and gifts that would usually go to landfill, and sells them cheaply to people once they have been refurbished. Also, it provides a mentoring service that enables retired people to pass on skills and knowledge to youngsters so that they can find jobs in areas such as warehousing and customer services. Smith said even middle-income families were now using the project to inexpensively replace big-ticket household items such as fridges, cookers and furniture as the cost of living crisis deepens. He added: “Previously, you could almost categorise those using services like ours as being among the most vulnerable in our community but the financial pressures are now adding up for people right across the board. “We are now increasingly helping the sort of folk that we normally wouldn’t expect to see.”","Community foodbank: In this day and age, it is obscene we are so needed as a safety net for people",https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/foodbanks-warmbanks/

Being the prime minister, he must have thought, has to amount to more than acknowledging a terrifying array of looming crises. When asked what you hope to do with your time in office, you’ve got to give a more inspiring answer than “cope”, even if you’re fortunate in following a leader who didn’t even manage that. What would be a clear, constructive, positive, yet achievable, initiative? Nothing fun at this bleak time – any whiff of levity could be accused of trivialising people’s suffering. And nothing that sounds expensive. Also nothing that sounds too leftwing, what with the Tory right calling Sunak a socialist for failing to cut taxes. But nothing that sounds too rightwing either, what with the Labour party being so far ahead in the polls. Plus there are many subject areas to avoid: health, transport, defence, the economy… Probably best if it doesn’t touch on any other countries, what with Brexit being such a sore point and China getting horribler and Russia obviously. And there’s the whole illegal immigration shitstorm, so maybe steer clear of abroad altogether. Also food and fuel and housing would be good areas not to mention. Plus it shouldn’t be something that sounds difficult or people won’t believe it’s going to happen. And it shouldn’t be anything that anyone cares too much about because, its achievability notwithstanding, it still probably won’t happen. What should it be? I’d have been stumped. My best idea was: “Every hard-working family will be given a free cactus.” They could sit on kitchen tables, as symbols of bristly resilience, while people try to work out how to pay the mortgages on their freezing homes. Little green shoots of spiny recovery sprouting all over an economic wasteland. Sunak went another way. He fell back on something he could rely on, the solace of many a swot in the face of moral complexity, myself included: maths. You know where you are with maths. Maths doesn’t let you down. Maths doesn’t go on strike, or arrive uninvited on the south coast, or die because it couldn’t get an ambulance, or send bullying texts, or appear on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. Let’s do more maths! That was his new initiative. Everyone should be studying maths until the age of 18, he declared. Who can argue with that? Eight million adults in the UK are only numerate to primary school level. That’s bad. But brilliantly, all those potential voters, who presumably hate maths, won’t have to do any at all, but only agree with the principle that they should have done more previously. No one who can vote will have to do anything they don’t want to. This is an entirely inoffensive policy. The education secretary, who my investigations tell me is called Gillian Keegan, might feel aggrieved that it doesn’t leave her with much to say in her next speech. Michael Gove used to have great fun with that brief – handing out bibles and making everyone read Thomas Hardy and memorise dates – and even Gavin Williamson got to cancel everyone’s exams. The importance of maths should be something Keegan gets to bang on about to easy applause, but the PM has nicked it because every single other policy area has gone toxic. But he was determined to make it sound massive: “This is personal for me,” it was reported that he was “expected to say” in his speech. And he did! “It’s the single most important reason why I came into politics: to give every child the highest possible standard of education.” Wow – it turns out he’s a stealth educationist. He was also expected to say: “Just half of all 16-19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills is letting our children down.” Admirable sentiments, though the phrase “our children’s jobs” raises the spectre of child labour. An unfortunate slip when families are struggling to afford food and fuel and the sick are left untreated. It’s all getting a bit Dickensian. But perhaps it’s deliberate. Is this heritage austerity? Back to when Britain was great? Perhaps by “studying maths” he means “doing data entry”? Good work for children with their nimble fingers, and much safer than picking fluff out of an industrial loom, so we must count our blessings. It was a slip because, of all the things he was “expected to say”, the phrase about “children’s jobs” was the only one he didn’t. Very wise. Bless him, he just wanted to say “children” as many times as possible. A focus group must have generated that finding: saying “children” is a good look for him. Better than for Truss the malfunctioning robot or Johnson the philanderer, who just kept having children. Sunak’s children look nice – he’s shared some lovely photos – it’s a relatable family unit. Keep saying “children”, Rishi, and people will believe you care. I approve of the maths plan, but it’s such a tiny thought. In most countries that we increasingly laughably consider our equivalents, maths up to the age of 18 has long been compulsory. Rather than having an idea, he’s just picked one of myriad ways in which Britain is worse than elsewhere and resolved to correct it. It’s like saying: “We really ought to start brushing our teeth.” A small, long-overdue correction to our educational practices coming from the leader of a party that’s been in power for 12 years. It’s lame. And it won’t happen. Sunak says he “will work with the sector to move towards all children studying some form of maths to 18”. “Work with” to “move towards”. Christ. Don’t hold your breath. As Keegan’s shadow, Bridget Phillipson, put it: “He cannot deliver this reheated, empty pledge without more maths teachers, yet the government has missed their target for new maths teachers year after year.” More teachers requires more money. The money must either be raised or moved from elsewhere. That means fewer missiles or nurses or tax cuts or more taxes. Perhaps maths will let him down after all.",More maths?

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and Aslef took industrial action which crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Union leaders will meet rail minister Huw Merriman as they continue to insist the Government is blocking a deal to end the long-running row over pay, jobs and conditions. Transport Secretary Mark Harper denies the allegation, saying he is facilitating talks between unions and employers. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Today I want to see the Government stop play-acting because the truth, written in black and white in their rail contracts, is that they’ve been in complete control of this dispute from day one. “The train operators cannot move without Government say-so. “Passengers, workers and businesses are suffering and even rail company managers are beginning to break ranks in despair at the Government’s approach. “The minister cannot hide behind this fairy story that he is just a facilitator. “His Government can end this dispute today by taking out the conditions they put in to torpedo a resolution and let the companies make a deal.” Meanwhile, Aslef leaders will consider an offer – made on Friday by the Rail Delivery Group on behalf of train operators – of a 4% pay rise for last year and 4% this year. Conditions were attached to the offer, such as speeding up the training of drivers, as well as over Sunday working arrangements. Rail union and industry officials will give evidence to the Transport Select Committee on Wednesday. A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The Transport Secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. “They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. “Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation and costing every household an extra £1,000.”",Union leaders to meet rail minister in bid to secure deal to end strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-mark-harper-mick-lynch-huw-merriman-rmt-b2258343.html

Last year was chaotic for domestic politics, with upheaval at Westminster and long-running argument at Holyrood on the constitution. Here are just five of the big problems and promises you want sorted for 2023. 1. Fix the NHS NHS Grampian took the desperate step of putting out an urgent social media appeal for staff off-duty or on holiday to come in to work over the festive period. And NHS Highland has warned Raigmore and Belford Hospitals are “very busy” and expressed concerns over a surge in flu patients. Patients across the north and north-east have also struggled to access their GP with one Aberdeen doctor revealing he is seeing three times the safe number of patients “on an almost-daily basis”. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf is facing mounting pressure to come forward with a recovery plan. He says Covid backlogs, rising cases of flu and Strep A, delayed discharged and cold weather are “all compounding” the usual pressures on the health service. The SNP minister is expected to deliver a statement addressing concerns at Holyrood on Tuesday. Meanwhile, NHS Grampian is waiting for an extra £7 million a year required to help more Moray women give birth in Elgin. Campaigners in Caithness continue to raise concerns over the lack of women’s healthcare in the county, with women facing 100-mile journeys to Inverness for treatment. 2. Will the A9 and A96 be dualled? It was confirmed just days before Christmas that a final decision on fully dualling the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness will not be made until well into next year. The SNP promised over a decade ago to dual the route by 2030. But this was thrown into doubt when the Scottish Greens were brought into government in 2021. An open survey of P&J readers, published on January 6, revealed the vast majority of respondents want the A96 dualled all the way. A project to dual the A9 between Inverness and Perth has also been hit by serious delays but the government has yet to give an update on its 2025 target completion date. Pressure on the SNP Government is intensifying after 13 people died on the stretch due to be dualled between the two cities. 3. We need better ferries Furious islanders from the Hebrides to Shetland have warned locals are packing up and quitting their communities in response to the “utterly chaotic” ferry system. The construction of two new ferries, MV Glen Sannox and Hull 802, is well behind schedule and over budget. The vessels, which were originally commissioned in 2015 from struggling shipyard Fergus Marine, are now years late and over a hundred million pounds over budget. The Holyrood inquiry continues but already the SNP is promising more. 4. Whatever happened to Freeports? Three locations across the north-east, Highlands and islands are vying for “green freeport” status from the UK and Scottish governments. Freeports get special tax status and are being promoted as job-creating goldmines. Others fear they are light on regulation and attractive to money launderers. A joint bid by Aberdeen and Peterhead ports is going up against bids by Cromarty Firth and Orkney for the two coveted spots. But bidders have been left in the dark since the summer over who will secure the special tax status, with Scottish Secretary Alister Jack admitting months ago that a decision has already been made. It is understood the ever-changing leadership of the Tory party delayed the announcement last year. 5. What is the future for oil and gas? The SNP conference in October seemed to finally push the future of oil and gas workers to the top of the agenda. Taking place in Aberdeen, Ms Sturgeon said her government has a “duty” to support workers into new green jobs. But there has been a lack of detail on the practicalities. Energy Secretary Michael Matheson is slated to deliver a statement on Scotland’s long-awaited energy strategy and “just transition” plan on Tuesday. The latter will focus on the offshore workforce, Mr Matheson told the Press and Journal last year. Energy policy is reserved to the UK Government and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will have a key role in charting the future of the oil and gas sector, from the licensing of future oil fields to the windfall tax.",5 problems people across the north of Scotland want politicians to fix in 2023,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/5243446/nhs-freeports-a9-a96-oil-gas-ferries/

The deck machinery specialist – based at Towie Barclay Works, near Turriff – is enjoying growth in the offshore floating wind market. Our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Alfie Cheyne, founder and chairman, Ace Winches. Growing demand in energy markets in both North America and the Middle East are also driving the business forward, it said. Ace Winches, whose many accolades over the years include prestigious Queen’s Awards in 2010 and 2013, has formed a subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates as part of its global growth strategy. And earlier this year it announced the opening of a subsidiary in Houston, Texas. Underlying earnings up 38% Chairman Alfie Cheyne said a strong financial performance during the 12 months to March 31 last year was a foundation “which bodes well for the future”. The company reported pre-tax profits of £4.5 million – down from £7.8m for the previous year, when results were boosted by the reversal of a £4.8m write-down. Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation raced ahead to £7.6m last year, up by 38% from £5.5m previously. Ownership tussle The most recent figure excludes one-off costs associated with a change of ownership, Turnover increased slightly to £28.3m, up from just shy of £28m the year before. Ace Winches’ 58-year-old chairman founded the business in 1992 but lost control of it to Balmoral Group in stages between 2017 and 2019. The relationship with Aberdeen-based Balmoral eventually turned sour and Mr Cheyne and his wife, Valerie, reacquired the firm in late 2021. Reflecting on 2021-22, Mr Cheyne said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. “It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is.” He added: “In this reporting period we have made an additional investment of £1.3m in our rental fleet in line with our twin objectives of diversification and geographic expansion. “It has been a year marked by significant growth and change – growth in the renewables market and a change in how we interact with our customers. “This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet, thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Green ambitions Mr Cheyne also highlighted the firm’s green credentials after it became carbon neutral. Operations at Towie Barclay Works are now powered by wind. On the firm’s wider green ambitions, chief commercial officer Gary Wilson said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East are indicators of our strategy going forward.” With more than 3,000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, Ace Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and other services in multiple sectors. Headcount averaged 155 during the 12 months to March 2022, down from 171 the year before. Mrs Cheyne, chief compliance officer, said the company was growing its workforce again. She added: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our graduate engineer numbers, providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.”",Ace Winches sets sights on global growth after &#8216;strong&#8217; results,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/local/5245423/ace-winches-sets-sights-on-global-growth-after-strong-results/

Earlier, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “happy to talk about pay” with unions as ministers held a series of meetings aimed at ending a wave of industrial unrest in the NHS and on the rail network. However, both the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” Unite said any suggestion that a one-off pay reward could be made in exchange for a boost in productivity was “absolutely ludicrous”. While other trade unions said that “progress” had been made, there was no sign that enough had been made for planned strikes to be called off. Unite negotiator Onay Kasab, speaking after a meeting with Mr Barclay, accused the Government of telling staff they would need to “justify” a payment through productivity. “This isn’t a factory we’re talking about, we’re talking about people who are working well beyond their contracted hours anyway just to get the job done because they care so much. “So, for the Government to be talking about productivity in exchange for a (payment) is an insult to every single one of our members.” Mr Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. Alongside talks with health unions, teaching unions were holding talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan ahead of announcements this week over whether their members will go on strike. Rail minister Huw Merriman called in train workers after sustained action crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Mr Kasab said: “I emphasise the thing to get out of today that is absolutely clear is that they want our members to give more in order for it to consider a payment. That is absolutely outrageous.” He said there had been no “detailed” discussion of what a pay settlement might look like, adding that the talks had left him “very angry”. He added: “The Government have missed yet another opportunity. We came here in good faith.” After the meeting, the GMB said that ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday, adding that the talks “fell well short” of anything needed to stop the walk-out. More than 10,000 GMB members are expected by the trade union to take to picket lines on Wednesday. “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis,” said Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary. “The public expects the Government to treat these talks seriously – it’s time they got on with it.” Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, told reporters that “progress” had been made but said there had been no “tangible” concessions. “It was a very civil meeting. We did actually manage to talk about pay – we didn’t get the tangible concessions that we might have hoped for that would enable us to call off the strikes later this week. “But it was definitely progress when you’re in a room with the Secretary of State talking about pay, I think. “He’s asked for our help to help with the Treasury to make the case for investment. We’ll certainly do that.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks. Elaine Sparkes, assistant director at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Although the meeting was more constructive this time, there is nothing tangible on the table. “As such, we’ll be announcing the first of our strike dates later this week as we continue to push for a fairer deal for our members and their colleagues.” The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement. On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”. “On pay, we’ve always said that the Government is happy to talk about pay demands and pay issues that are anchored in what’s reasonable, what’s responsible, what’s affordable for the country.” Downing Street earlier warned that concerns about inflation had not gone away as the Government prepares for the next round of pay talks for 2023/24. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Government was open to listening to trade unions’ concerns. “We are happy to listen to the pressures they think they are under, what they think is fair, responsible and affordable, and likewise we will provide detail about what we think is affordable, and also the challenge that inflation poses to all of this as well.” Elsewhere, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch dodged questions about progress in rail talks but said that further discussions would take place. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, gave a shrugging gesture as he left the Department for Transport but also declined to give any detail of the meeting. The National Education Union said that “no concrete progress” had been made in its talks with the education secretary. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “While there is the thought of further meetings, there is no sense of concrete progress as yet. There is no offer, there is no change. “There are further discussions to happen that we will engage in while still urging our members to vote in the ballot.” Mr Courtney added: “There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action because we think these meetings are only happening because of the threat of industrial action.” Business Secretary Grant Shapps has said ministers were seeking a more “collaborative approach”, telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “It is a new year. We are very keen to see these strikes come to a conclusion. We want to see a collaborative approach.”",Strikes set to go ahead after ‘insulting’ talks with Health Secretary,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/strikes-set-to-go-ahead-after-insulting-talks-with-health-secretary-b2258736.html

The company, which earlier this year announced the opening of ACE Winches Inc. in Houston, Texas, reported a pre-tax profit of £4.5m, while there was also a slight increase in turnover to £28.3m. ACE Winches Chairman Alfie Cheyne, who, in 2021, returned to the organisation he founded, said the performance gives the company a strong platform to build from. He said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone.

As part of that ambition, ACE has formed a subsidiary company in the United Arab Emirates, ensuring the range of high-quality services from concept design through to manufacture, equipment rental and further support, is delivered globally. Chief Commercial Officer Gary Wilson​ said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East, are indicators of our strategy going forward, as we place a focus on areas of opportunity where our capabilities and solutions single us out as a contractor of choice. “We have a strong reputation that has been built up through our commitment to innovation and investing in our people and services over the last 30 years, and we are looking forward to bringing that expertise to more of our customers in North America and the Middle East, as well as markets we already serve.” With more than 3000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, ACE Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and deploying solutions across multiple sectors.

The Jamesfield development is a joint venture with Harmony Energy, following TagEnergy’s acquisition of a 60% stake in the project in November 2021. It will use a system of Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries, together with Tesla’s Autobidder software for real-time trading and control. It is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter this year, with renewable energy company RES as asset manager. Franck Woitiez, chief executive of TagEnergy, said the company's third battery energy storage facility in the UK reinforced its commitment to the country and its green energy goals. “This is another important milestone in TagEnergy’s growth in the UK as we leverage our strong storage expertise to support the UK grid and propel the nation to net-zero carbon emissions by connecting more competitive renewable power. “We are excited to enter this next phase in the project in partnership with Harmony Energy and with the support of Santander UK as we grow our UK footprint to accelerate the energy transition.” Mark Cumbo, director of specialised and project finance at Santander UK, said: “This follows the funding we provided TagEnergy in 2021 to support Hawkers Hill Energy Park in Dorset, and to TagEnergy and Harmony Energy in 2022 for Chapel Farm near Luton. “Santander UK strongly supports clients such as TagEnergy and Harmony Energy that are bringing additional capacity to enable greater contribution from renewables to the UK’s energy sector.” Peter Kavanagh, chief executive of Harmony Energy, said: “We have been working on this site for over four years and are delighted to be progressing to this next stage with TagEnergy, following our partnership which was announced in 2021. “Securing debt funding from Santander UK demonstrates a growing appetite from institutions to support battery developments and we look forward to working with it.” Jamesfield is the third TagEnergy investment in battery storage facilities in the UK to reach financial close following its entry into the UK market in 2021. Commissioning of its first project, Hawkers Hill Energy Park, took place in September and construction of its second project, Chapel Farm, started last February. Jamesfield, Chapel Farm and Hawkers Hill, together with previously-announced projects Roaring Hill in Fife, Lakeside in North Yorkshire and more recently, Pitkevy in Scotland, take TagEnergy’s secured portfolio in the UK to date to 320MW/640MWh. TagEnergy partnered with Balance Power in October to build, own, and operate 500MW of Balance Power’s renewable energy pipeline requiring an investment of more than £300m over the next four years. Since its formation in 2019, TagEnergy has assembled a portfolio of close to 4GW based on solar, wind and battery storage technologies in the UK, Portugal, Spain, France and Australia.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Mr Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. The Health Secretary suggested that improvements in efficiency and productivity could “unlock additional funding” for the 2023/24 pay settlement, but unions want workers paid more now, raising the possibility of a one-off lump sum to help with the soaring cost of living. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” The GMB union said ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday after the talks “fell short”. Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary, said: “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks.

The source said talk about productivity and efficiency improvements had been linked to the 2023/24 pay settlement, rather than a one-off payment. In the Commons, Mr Barclay told MPs: “It is right that we are engaging with the trade unions, I was pleased to meet the staff council of the NHS today and indeed the chair of the NHS Staff Council, Sara Gorton, said the discussions had made progress. “Notwithstanding one trade union leader who wasn’t in the talks giving an interview outside the department to comment on what had and had not been said in those talks, but we want to work constructively with the trade unions on that.” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. An ally of Mr Barclay said the issue of a one-off payment was raised at the meeting by the unions, rather than the Health Secretary, who “listened to what he had to say and agreed to take it away”. The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement. On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”.

It follows recent articles on inflation, energy, food and the cost of living. Canada: assertive unions getting results Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Canada’s trade union movement is among the more resilient in the OECD, the club of developed countries. This is related to laws that prevent “free riding”, which is where workers can benefit from collective agreements without being union members. Union density in Canada has been around 30% of workers since the turn of the century, although membership in the private sector is barely half that and slowly falling. In contrast, unionisation is high in public services (over 75%) and growing. This relatively stability has left Canadian workers better prepared to confront the impact of inflation on their wages. Unions made higher wage demands than in recent decades, and more frequently went on strike (continuing a trend from 2021). From January to October 2022, there were 145 strikes, and the final year tally will likely exceed the 161 in 2021 – itself a marked increase. A total of 1.9 million person-days of work were lost in strikes up to October (the highest in 15 years). Unlike in recent years, the majority were in the private sector. A spring wave of strikes in construction in Ontario (Canada’s most populous province) symbolised the increased militancy. At peak, over 40,000 workers downed tools for higher wages, including carpenters, dry-wallers and engineers. Tentative agreements reached by officials were sometimes rejected by members, prolonging the strikes. A second historic flash point came later in the year when Ontario’s right-wing government invoked a rarely used constitutional clause to override the right to strike for 55,000 education support workers. After unions in the public and private sector threatened a province-wide general strike, the government backed down. Meanwhile, employer lockouts have virtually disappeared. This tactic, in which employers suspend operations until workers agree to terms being offered, had only been used eight times by October, compared to 60 per year a decade ago. Annual wage growth increased modestly to an average of 5% by late in the year. That still lagged the 6.8% inflation, but closed the gap from 2021. It remains to be seen whether this union pressure can be sustained in the face of rapid interest rate increases, a likely recession in 2023, and continued government suppression of union rights in some provinces. United Kingdom: an olive branch for the health service? Phil Tomlinson, Professor of Industrial Strategy, University of Bath The UK’s latest winter of discontent is extending into 2023 as the country endures its largest wave of strikes in over 30 years. Most are in the public sector, where pay offers are well below inflation and significantly lag private companies. The sense of grievance is high following the austerity and real-terms pay cuts of the 2010s. Strikes – estimated to have cost the UK economy £1.7 billion in 2022 – are being co-ordinated across different unions, adding to the public inconvenience. The UK government has steadfastly refused to yield, however. It has hidden behind independent recommendations by public-sector pay review bodies, despite not always following them. They have also claimed that inflation matching public sector pay rises would cost each UK household an extra £1,000 a year, though this figure has been debunked. The Treasury also echoes Bank of England concerns about setting off a wage-price spiral. Yet this is unlikely, given the current inflation is largely down to supply shocks (from COVID and the war in Ukraine), while average wage growth is well below inflation. There is an economic case for a generous deal, especially in the National Health Service (NHS): with over 133,000 unfilled vacancies, better wages might help improve staff retention and recruitment. Of course, funding this in a recession involves tough choices. Higher taxes would be politically difficult with the tax burden at a 70-year high. Higher government borrowing could aggravate inflation if accommodated by the Bank of England increasing the money supply through more quantitative easing. Public opinion appears largely sympathetic to the strikes, especially in the NHS. But if the government relents in one sector, it sets a precedent for others, with potentially wider economic consequences. For the NHS, it may instead bring forward public sector pay review body negotiations for 2023 to allow for an improved deal – possibly alongside a one-off hardship payment. Elsewhere it will probably hold firm and hope the trade unions lose their resolve. Australia and New Zealand: strikes remain rare despite inflation Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Strikes in Australia have become very rare in recent decades, thanks to restrictive labour laws passed since the 1990s. Despite historically low unemployment and wages lagging far behind inflation, these laws continue to short-circuit most industrial action. In 2022, union density fell to 12.5% of employees, an all-time low. As recently as 1990, union density was over 50% of workers. Union members can legally strike only after negotiations, ballots and specific plans for action have been publicly divulged (thus fully revealing union strategy to the employer). Even when there are strikes, they tend to be short. A total of 182 industrial disputes occurred in the year to September. (The statistics don’t distinguish between strikes and employer lockouts, which have become common in Australia.) This is similar to the pre-COVID years, following a drop in 2020, and only a fraction of 1970s and 1980s industrial action. The only visible increase in strike action in 2022 was a series of one-day protest strikes organised by teachers and health care workers in New South Wales, the country’s most populous state. Having put up with a decade of austere wage caps by the conservative state government, they decided they had had enough as inflation picked up. Most other workers have been passive despite Australia experiencing among the slowest wage growth of any major industrial country. Nominal wages grew just 2% per year over the decade to 2021. That rose to 3.1% by late 2022, but it’s still less than half the 7.3% inflation rate. Australia’s newly elected Labor government did pass a series of important labour law reforms at the end of 2022, aimed at strengthening collective bargaining and wage growth. That might herald incremental improvement in workers’ bargaining power in the years ahead. The industrial relations outlook in New Zealand is somewhat more hospitable for workers and their unions. Union density increased in 2021, to 17% of employees (from 14% in 2020). Average ordinary hourly earnings grew an impressive 7.4% in the latest 12-month period – helped by a 6% boost in the minimum wage by New Zealand’s Labour government. Industrial action remains rare – perhaps in part because workers are successfully lifting wages via other means. No official strike data is available for 2022, but in 2021, just 20 work stoppages occurred, down sharply from an average of 140 per year in the previous three years. Indonesia: anger against labour law reforms Nabiyla Risfa Izzati, Lecturer of Labour Law, Universitas Gadjah Mada A few weeks ago, the government replaced its controversial “omnibus law” with new emergency regulation. This was in response to the Indonesian constitutional court finding it unconstitutional in 2021. Passed in late 2020, the omnibus law embodies President Joko Widodo’s ambition to attract foreign investors by slashing red tape at the cost of employees’ rights. It made it easier for businesses to lay off employees without prior notice. It also lowered statutory severance pay and extended the maximum length of temporary contracts, while ignoring worker safety. In 2022, its new formula to determine the minimum wage also resulted in the lowest annual increase ever. The law attracted much criticism from workers, activists and civil society organisations. The new emergency regulation is arguably even more problematic. The majority of its provision simply copies the omnibus law. Several changes and additional provisions are confusing and overlap with previous regulations, as well as leaving many loopholes that could be exploited in future. Yet despite complaints from workers and trade unions that the new rules were passed suddenly and without consultation, strike action is out of the question. Strikes are not popular because they can only be organised with permission from the company in question. If labourers hold informal strikes, employers also entitled to get rid of them. Public protests are the obvious alternative, though pandemic rules restricting mobility and mass gatherings have made these difficult. Nevetheless, thousands or perhaps even millions of workers staged protests in their respective cities in the second half of 2022. The workers wanted the omnibus law revoked, and for the government to not use the minimum wage formulations stipulated in the law. The demonstrations got more intense as the government raised subsidised fuel prices in September, which boosted already high inflation due to rising food prices. The government has since issued a separate regulation to determine the 2023 minimum wage, so the demands were successful, although both workers and employers are furious that the minimum wage rules have changed again under the emergency regulation. Clearly the protesters did not see the rest of the rules in the omnibus law removed. Some workers have been protesting on social media. This might not induce the government to change the law, but a few viral tweets have pushed several businesses to change abusive practices. The controversy is likely to continue in 2023 and into the election year of 2024, especially amid possible massive layoffs in the midst of a global recession. United States: worker protest showing signs of life Marick Masters, Professor of Business and Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Wayne State University US workers organised and took to the picket line in increased numbers in 2022 to demand better pay and working conditions, leading to optimism among labour leaders and advocates that they’re witnessing a turnaround in labour’s sagging fortunes. Teachers, journalists and baristas were among tens of thousands of workers who went on strike. And it took an act of Congress to prevent 115,000 railroad employees from walking out as well. In total, there have been at least 20 major work stoppages involving upwards of 1,000 workers each in 2022, up from 16 in 2021, plus hundreds more that were smaller. Workers at Starbucks, Amazon, Apple and dozens of other companies also filed over 2,000 petitions to form unions during the year – the most since 2015. Workers won 76% of the 1,363 elections that were held. Historically, however, these figures are tepid. The number of major work stoppages has been plunging for decades, from nearly 200 as recently as 1980. As of 2021, union membership was at about the lowest level on record, at 10.3%. In the 1950s, over one in three workers belonged to a union. The deck is still heavily stacked against unions, with unsupportive labour laws and very few employers showing real receptivity to having a unionised workforce. Unions are limited in how much they can change public policy. Reforming labour law through legislation has remained elusive, and the results of the 2022 midterms are not likely to make it easier. Nonetheless, public support for labour is at its highest since 1965, with 71% saying they approve of unions, according to a Gallup poll in August. And workers themselves are increasingly showing an interest in joining them. In 2017, 48% of workers polled said they would vote for union representation, up from 32% in 1995, the last time the question was asked. Future success may depend on unions’ ability to tap into their growing popularity and emulate the recent wins in establishing union representation at Starbucks and Amazon, as well as the successful “Fight for $15” campaign, which since 2012 has helped pass US$15 minimum wage laws in a dozen states and Washington DC. The odds may be steep, but the seeds of opportunity are there if labour can exploit them. This is an excerpt from an article published on January 5 2023. France: militant unions risk going too far Stéphanie Matteudi-Lecocq, Chercheuse au LEREDS, Directrice practice Chez Alixio, Université de Lille France in 2022 saw new industrial protests, from blockades of oil refineries, to unprecedented strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants, to rail workers staying at home on public holidays. TotalEnergies announced “super profits” in the second quarter of 2022 and increased CEO Patrick Pouyanné’s salary by 52% to €5,944,129. In September the militant CGT union demanded a 10% salary increase for workers and called for a strike at the group’s refineries. Five of Total’s refineries went on strike, joined by two owned by ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso. Esso was already talking to its unions about a pay deal, but Total had only planned to open negotiations in November. The strikes in the refineries threatened to bring France to a standstill, and the CGT used its power over this key resource to demand that discussions begin more quickly with Total (in the end, the company negotiated earlier and pay deals were done, ending the strikes by early November). The strike at EDF’s nuclear power stations similarly gave the company’s workers the balance of power because it made it impossible for France to build up energy reserves (since fossil fuels had to be burned to make up for the lack of nuclear power). In the end, the company signed deals with the unions in October. Unions may have succeeded in both cases, but they are arguably endangered by these kinds of practices. Too many trades union leaders remain stuck in their old militant ways. There’s a fragile balance between negotiation and protest, and such ransom tactics might damage unions’ public image, making dialogue more difficult in future. In 50 years, the rate of unionisation in France has already halved from over 20% to around 10%. It’s telling that two of the major strikes at the end of 2022, first by train workers and then by general practitioners, were initiated by groups independent from the unions. They both started spontaneously through social media and the unions found out very late. In 2023 the unions have an opportunity to improve their influence if they manage to prevent the government from passing its unpopular bill on pensions, which seeks to raise the full pensionable retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65. The unions have already announced their strong opposition to the bill. With major demonstrations due to take place after the full bill is presented today, January 10, it will be interesting to see their tactics. This is based on an excerpt from an article published in October 2022. Spain: unequal support measures could cause trouble Rubén Garrido-Yserte, Director del Instituto Universitario de Análisis Económico y Social, Universidad de Alcalá Global inflation is triggering a global economic slowdown and interest rates raised to levels not seen since before 2008. Interest rates will continue to rise in 2023, especially affecting economies as indebted as Spain. It will undermine both families’ disposable income and the profitability of companies (especially small ones), while making public debt repayments more expensive. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to cause a sustained increase in the cost of the shopping basket in the medium term. Government measures have partially mitigated this loss of purchasing power so far. Spain capped power prices, subsidised fuel and made public transport free for urbanites and commuters. There were agreements with banks to refinance mortgages for the most vulnerable families. Plus there have been increases in pensions and public salaries and there are plans to raise the minimum wage. However, many of these measures must necessarily be temporary. The danger is that they come to be seen as rights that should not be renounced. They also distort the economy and create problems with fairness by excluding or insufficiently supporting some groups. Private salaries will not rise enough to cover inflation, for instance. The government’s measures have been such that there has been very little industrial action in response to the cost of living crisis. The danger is that they create a scenario where today’s calm may be the harbinger of a social storm tomorrow.

Ms Somerville said there is still “some distance” between the two sides in the pay dispute. On Tuesday, primary schools around the country closed after last-ditch talks failed to prevent strike action, with secondary school staff set to walk out on Wednesday. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. A meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT), which brings together unions, local authorities and the Scottish Government, took place on Monday in an attempt to avert the strike action. As the Scottish Parliament resumed following the winter recess, Conservative Stephen Kerr spoke about the SNCT meeting. He said: “Teachers are on strike for the first time in 40 years, because this SNP Government has repeatedly let them down.” Ms Somerville said it had been “constructive”, adding that she could not give further details while negotiations are ongoing. Referring to “anti-trade union” legislation at Westminster, she continued: “I will take no lectures from Mr Kerr or any other Conservative member of this parliament, saying that we should be doing more to actually settle disputes.” The Lib Dems’ Willie Rennie asked if there would be a new offer for teachers, saying: “The Education Secretary does seem to be very chilled out and relaxed.” Ms Somerville said both sides in the dispute would have to compromise in order to reach a resolution, adding: “We will, of course, leave no stone unturned to try and do that as quickly as possible. “No one wants to see strike action in our schools.” Speaking on BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland programme earlier, Ms Somerville described the union pay demands as “simply unaffordable”. After talks ended in failure, members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), NASUWT, Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association (SSTA) and the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS) are taking strike action. It follows SSTA and NASUWT members taking two days of action in December while EIS members walked out on November 24. Asked whether she expected a new offer to be on the table before the end of the week, Ms Somerville said: “We’ll continue discussions with the unions. “I think the challenge that we have is we remain some distance apart on what the Scottish Government and local government can afford and can put on the table from the union demand which is, of course, a 10% increase in pay. “If that had been accepted, if the 5% had been accepted, you would’ve actually seen teachers have a 21.8% cumulative rise since 2018. “So we’re trying very hard to have a fair and affordable package on the table but we do remain unfortunately some distance apart.” She added: “The pay demands we’re having from our trade union colleagues are simply unaffordable for the Scottish Government working on a fixed budget, already allocated, also eroded by inflation and that does make it a very difficult and challenging process to come to a conclusion and resolution on.” Earlier in the programme, Mike Corbett, NASUWT Scotland national official, echoed the concerns that unions and Government were still far away from agreement on pay. He said the last offer made in November was “dressed up as an improved offer” but did not improve pay for the “vast majority of teachers”. He added: “There’s still no formal revised offer on the table and that is the reason why our members and others feel they’ve got no alternative but to be out on strike again today and tomorrow.” Nicola Sturgeon also spoke to journalists about the strike on Tuesday. The First Minister said: “I deeply regret that we have industrial action in our schools. “I don’t think that’s in the interest of young people at all. “That said, I understand the strength of feeling of teachers and we highly value the teaching profession.” However, she said: “I can’t create additional funding that we don’t have and I’ve tried to be really honest with unions across the public sector. “We’re trying to be as fair as possible while maximising pay increases.”",Somerville: No stone will be left unturned in bid to resolve school strikes,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/scottish-government-teachers-education-secretary-scottish-parliament-conservative-b1052061.html

Gareth Davies, the auditor and comptroller general at the NAO, said keeping on top of conflicts of interest was a “crucial part of public stewardship” that was not always followed during the VIP fast lane process. He said the government had given detailed responses on how it would improve its processes after reports from the NAO and others highlighting a failure to adhere to basic standards of procurement when awarding some contracts during the pandemic. But the auditor general said the NAO was watching closely to make sure its recommendations on procurement and pandemic preparedness “do not get lost” as the government deals with other crises such as Ukraine and high energy prices. “We are always careful to recognise the exceptional circumstances but despite the intense pressure it is always necessary to cover basic areas of transparency,” Davies said. “Publishing what you’ve done within the normal timescales is still possible even in an emergency and the whole process around conflicts of interest. “You may well need a speeded up system for referring plausible suppliers of PPE into the system but you should absolutely insist that people should declare it if they have a private interest in that supplier, particularly if they are holding a position of authority or responsibility like a peer or an MP or a senior civil servant. That just couldn’t be demonstrated. “There were clearly people attempting to do that at different stages but there wasn’t a clear trail of how that had been handled. The reason was the sheer pressure of the emergency but you can see now where that leads you if you are not careful.” His comments come after the scandal over Mone, on a leave of absence as a Conservative peer, who is the subject of an inquiry over her alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro during the pandemic. She has vowed to clear her name. Davies gave his assessment after the NAO carried out 36 detailed reports on the £300bn of government’s spending during the Covid pandemic. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the NAO was looking carefully at resilience to help the UK become better financially prepared for events that may require big public spending, guarding against the “collective failure of imagination” to prepare adequately for a major pandemic. He said there would be better “stress testing” of emergency responses, and the NAO would look at preparedness across the board, asking: “How do you avoid being caught out by this?” “You could argue it has happened on more than just Covid. What’s happening on energy is pretty unprecedented and needs another emergency scheme developed at high speed from scratch. We don’t want to have to do that every time,” he said. Davies also warned about the effects of inflation on public sector budgets, especially major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and roads, as well as highlighting the risks that the NHS will not meet its targets on eliminating waits of longer than a year by 2025. Davies said the NAO has been pointing out the “headwinds that the NHS is facing in implementing the planned approach” to waiting lists as well as highlighting the “numbers that the plan was based on assumed the best case scenario … not a severe winter in cases of flu and … [without] the industrial action that is currently under way”. He said the NAO’s report from November highlighted “serious risks” in meeting the 2025 target on eliminating waits of longer than 12 months and its job was now to monitor progress and “help identify barriers to getting through the backlog faster”. “Clearly, a lot of those risks that we identified are still present,” he added. Rishi Sunak recommitted to the NHS waiting list targets last week as one of his major priorities. Davies said inflation was a major risk to the NHS budget as well as departments with exposure to construction costs such as “HS2 and the other rail and road improvement schemes”. Warning that the government has “difficult decisions” ahead on major infrastructure projects, he said it was possible to reduce the scope of some projects or make the case for more money but on others said: “You either do it or you don’t: you have a have binary choice there. So there are some very difficult decisions for government.” Davies said HS2 was a “good example where the legs that have currently been committed to are going to cost more than when the most recent decision to recommit to the schemes was taken, so that’s going to have to be taken into account in one way or another, either through additional funding or through looking at the future scope of the scheme”.","MPs and peers should declare links to firms they back for contracts, says NAO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/mps-and-peers-should-declare-links-to-firms-they-back-for-contracts-says-nao

Against the euro, it’s lost 0.3 of a eurocent to €1.129.Concerns over the UK’s economy prospects have been weighing on the pound recently.Georgette Boele, senior FX strategist at ABN Amro, explained:“The economic outlook for the UK has already deteriorated substantially and is worse than that for the U.S. and the eurozone.” With the UK expected to fall into recession, the Bank of England may raise interest rates more slowly than forecast, which would also weaken sterling.The UK was the only G7 country to suffer a drop in productivity in 2021, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show.Output per hour worked in current prices was £46.92 in the UK in 2021, 10% lower than the other G7 nations’ average, the ONS says, and down from £47.58 in 2020.All other G7 countries saw a rise in output per hour worked, apart from Japan where there was a lack of data for the ONS to work with.In 2021, the UK’s output per hour worked was lower than France, Germany and the United States, but higher than Canada and Italy, the report shows.In 2021, the UK’s output per hour worked was lower than:▪️ France▪️ Germany▪️ the USA But higher than:▪️ Canada▪️ Italy➡️ https://t.co/WeWKrcwgLX— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 11, 2023 The UK’s average output per hour grew third fastest (5.1%) over 2020 and 2021 out of the G6 countries (the G7 without Japan).

With the economy set to enter recession, the nation’s productivity puzzle will be a key challenge for the Prime Minister and businesses to overcome in the year ahead. “Productivity has a huge impact on the economy and people’s standard of living. But growing NHS waiting lists, diminishing access to treatment and surging economic inactivity due to ill-health are all weighing on productivity in the UK. “Businesses that proactively implement effective incentivisation and employee benefits programmes throughout their entire workforce will be best placed to retain staff, drive better performance and grow in a post-Covid landscape.”UK bank NatWest has announced a new package of Cost of Living support measures, including £5.7m of funding for charities and partners.NatWest is giving £1m to the Trussell Trust, the food bank charity, to support the Help through Hardship scheme, plus over £1.6m to the debt advice sector; £900k for Responsible Finance to support provision of accessible credit to people; and a £1m partnership with Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) to provide cost of living support.NatWest is also giving struggling customers more time to repay debts, it says: From early February this year, where customers have missed several payments on an unsecured debt such as a loan or overdraft, the bank will extend the time for them to repay their debt from 18 to 24 months, giving them more time and flexibility. European financial markets are relatively upbeat after a good showing on Wall Street last night, ahead of the next US inflation numbers on Thursday, says AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.“It helped that a speech by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell yesterday didn’t contain any shocks which would cause investors to worry about markets even more.

Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/ShutterstockJD Sports said more work available for its young shoppers and better availability of key brands helped spur a surge in sales over Christmas, my colleague Sarah Butler reports.The retailer, which operates in Europe and the US as well as the UK, said sales surged more than 10% in six months to New Year’s Eve, compared to 5% growth in the first half of the year.Growth was strongest in the US and in stores - but it also saw growth online as shoppers could pick up orders from stores, staving off concerns about deliveries. Régis Schultz, the chief executive of JD, said young shoppers had more cash in their pockets than a year ago thanks to the reopening of retail and hospitality which had provided jobs, while inflation had prompted people to go out and buy instead of waiting for bargains. He added that competition from online pure plays was waning as the costs of delivery racked up. “Investors are now saying to online players you have got to make money.

In the meantime, though, concerns about a recession and some doubts about how quickly Chinese demand will rebound when Covid infections are so high are putting a lid on any upside in oil.Investors are also relieved that Jerome Powell, the head of America’s Federal Reserve central bank, didn’t push back against expectations of a slowing in US interest rate rises when he spoke yesterday.The markets are also hoping for a drop in US inflation, when the latest consumer price index figures are released.Boyadjian points out that a drop in inflation could encourage the Fed to stop hiking interest rates as rapidly.Sentiment was boosted on Friday from signs that wage pressures in the United States are easing and that the services sector is headed for a sharp slowdown, but the hawkish rhetoric that later followed revived recession worries. If Thursday’s CPI figures point to further moderation in inflation in December, it’s likely to fuel bets that the Fed’s tightening cycle is nearing the end.The internationally-focused FTSE 100 outperformed major rivals last year.

Heathrow says this is the highest passenger increase of any airport in Europe, “and possibly worldwide”.But it warns:We are concerned that the recovery of the aviation sector, which is critical to the economy, could be set back by the reintroduction of testing for travellers in the UK and elsewhere in response to increasing COVID levels in China, even though governments acknowledge there is no scientific basis for doing so.UK prime minister Rishi Sunak decided to introduce tests on arrivals from China at the end of December, after other countries including the US and Italy brought in similar measures.But scientists told the Observer that screening people coming from China would make little difference, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the UK was already very high, while airport checks had been shown to be unreliable in pinpointing disease carriers.Sunak’s U-turn on China Covid tests is a political move, say scientistsRead moreIf there is to be a correction in UK house prices, it will be driven by the homeowners whose fixed rate mortgage deals are set to expire over the next 12 months, says Zainab Atiyyah, analyst at Third Bridge.Mortgage and Bank of England interest rates started to increase during 2022 – and at least 1.4 millionUK households face the prospect of interest rate rises when they renew their fixed rate mortgages this year.➡️ https://t.co/HwWjla2Iwl pic.twitter.com/QKvIRIYbOU— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 9, 2023 But the UK’s “massive undersupply of new-build and second-hand houses.” will cushion that effect, Atiyyah points out.“Overall, our experts expect a slowdown in sales to continue in 2023 despite new stamp duty thresholds, as supply continues to dwindle.” “Those on Help to Buy deals will be crossing their fingers and hoping their deals don’t fall apart as new homes are delayed or not completed by the end of the year.

These claims, combined with further increases in motor inflation, have had a significant impact on our underwriting result for 2022.Direct Line says it expects around £90m of claims from the ‘freeze event’ in December. It has helped three thousand customers deal with burst pipes, water tanks and other related damage.Direct Line says:This, together with the freeze event from January 2022 and subsidence related claims over the summer means that we currently expect total weather claims to be in the region of £140 million for 2022, well above our 2022 expectation of £73 million.Direct Line’s motor insurance division also saw an increase in third party claims inflation during the fourth quarter of last year, and more claims in the quarter --partly due to adverse weather conditions.Shares in Direct Line have tumbled 28%, to 166p.JD Sports has also predicted its profits will be towards the top end of expectations, following a jump in sales over Christmas.JD Sports’ revenues grew by over 10% in the 22 weeks to 31 December 2022, accelerating to more than 20% in the six-weeks to 31 December 2022.It now expects pre-tax profits for the year to 28 January to be “towards the top end” of market expectations (£933m to £985m), although the final performance depends how the post-Christmas sales go.Shares in JD Sports have jumped 4.6% in early trading, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.Record sales of Champagne and prosecco have helped to push profits at Sainsbury’s to the upper end of forecasts.The supermarket chain has reported that profits this year are expected to be towards the upper end of its guidance range of £630m to £690m, although still below last year’s profits of £730m.J Sainsbury’s retail sales, excluding fuel, rose by 5.2% year-on-year in its third quarter (to 7th January). Grocery sales were 5.6% higher – and 12.5% ahead of pre-pandemic levels.And in the Christmas period, sales rose 7.1%, with grocery sales up 7.1%, general merchandise sales up 7.4% and clothing sales up 5.1%.That included a 22% jump in Taste the Difference Mince Pies, and a 49% rise in Taste the Difference Panettone, while there was “record sales for Champagne and prosecco”.But Simon Roberts, chief executive of J Sainsbury, flags that 2023 will be tough for households.“We understand money will be exceptionally tight this year particularly as many people wait for Christmas bills to land.

Rishi Sunak had previously refused to say whether he uses private healthcare, insisting it was ""not really relevant"". It followed a press report that Mr Sunak is registered with a private GP practice which charges £250 per consultation. At PMQs, Mr Sunak praised his local hospital ""for the fantastic care they have given my family"". ""That's why I'm passionately committed to protecting it with more funding, more doctors and nurses, and a clear plan to cut the waiting lists,"" he added. Mr Sunak had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that his healthcare was ""a personal choice"". ""As a general policy I wouldn't ever talk about me or my family's healthcare situation … it's not really relevant,"" he told the programme. Registering with an NHS GP does not exclude someone from using private healthcare. The prime minister's spokeswoman said Mr Sunak did not currently have private cover but declined to say when he registered with the NHS. ""In principle, he believes that the personal health details of individuals should remain private, but given the level of interest and in the interests of transparency he has set out that he is registered with a NHS GP,"" she said. A newspaper report in November suggested Mr Sunak was registered with a private GP practice that offers on-the-day appointments and home visits. Latest NHS figures show that in November last year, 58% of NHS patients were not seen on the day they made an appointment. At the same time, a record high of more than seven million people are waiting for hospital treatment. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in response to Mr Sunak's comments that the prime minister ""will find out what it's like to wait on hold at 08:00 as you call for an appointment"". Sir Keir's spokesman confirmed the Labour leader had never used private healthcare. He said he was ""not going to comment on individual health choices"" and Labour was focused on ""ensuring we have the best possible NHS"" for everyone in the country. Sir Keir also clashed with Mr Sunak over the government's plan for new legislation to enforce minimum service levels in the NHS and other key sectors. The Tories had gone ""from clapping nurses to sacking nurses"", Sir Keir said, adding that nurses and ambulance workers would not be on strike if the prime minister had negotiated. The prime minister said Sir Keir would not agree to minimum service levels in the NHS ""because he's on the side of his union paymasters, not patients"". Mr Sunak added that he wanted ""to have constructive dialogue with the unions"" and had accepted the recommendations of independent pay review bodies. Earlier, health unions announced they are pulling out of the NHS Pay Review Body process to determine pay for next year. The 14 unions - representing more than one million ambulance staff, nurses and other NHS workers in England - have called for direct negotiations with ministers about pay. Mr Sunak's comments followed Health Secretary Steve Barclay confirming he used an NHS doctor. Pressed on whether he has NHS care during an interview on LBC, Mr Barclay replied: ""Yes, I don't subscribe to private provision. ""But I don't have a problem with people, with their own money, who wish to spend that money on private healthcare. ""I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing for people to want to do."" Some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have made a point of drawing attention to their use of the NHS when they were prime minister. David Cameron often spoke about how the NHS cared for his disabled son, while Boris Johnson said the health service saved his life after he fell seriously ill with Covid. But when Mrs Thatcher was prime minister she was candid about her use of private health insurance, which she said was vital for her to ""go into hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want"".",PMQs: Rishi Sunak says he is registered with NHS doctor,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64237830?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Mr Kerr slammed the SNP for treating experienced workers as being easily replaceable after the report stated “the age profile of oil and gas workers means a significant proportion are expected to retire” during the First Minister’s acceleration of closing the industry. The energy strategy added it is positive that fewer young people were entering the sector, stating 12 per cent of the oil and gas workforce is under 30. This is despite warnings from the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board that more workers are required to meet future levels of labour demand. But the SNP’s aim of closing down the sector is at odds with what their Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, believes after he said last year that investment in North Sea oil and gas was vital for jobs in Aberdeen. Mr Kerr, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for net zero, energy and transport, said: “The SNP is threatening to destroy the lives of oil and gas workers with its uninformed intention of closing down the sector at its earliest point. “The assertion that the majority of these workers will be retiring is utterly reckless and a slap in the face to those who have dedicated years of service to such a valuable industry to our north-east economy. “This report implies it is a good thing fewer young people are entering the sector when all the evidence points to the very opposite as more people are needed to cope with labour demand. “The negative narrative of this is putting our younger generation off from having a long, productive career in an industry which supports countries worldwide. “Oil and gas is essential to securing our energy supply while also protecting tens of thousands of Scottish jobs. Yet this SNP energy strategy completely undermines the sector which will result in us relying on more expensive imports which do more damage to the environment. “This last week, many north-east residents watched in horror as a baleful, unnatural force threatened to hamper the livelihoods of North Sea workers. “After Nicola Sturgeon’s bid to toss more than 70,000 oil and gas jobs in the skip and wreck the energy transition, they should probably give it another week before trying to watch The Rig as well.” Do you want to respond to this article?

We need to leave the age of fossil fuel behind, swiftly and decisively. But what drives our machines won’t change until we change what drives our ideas. The visionary organiser adrienne maree brown wrote not long ago that there is an element of science fiction in climate action: “We are shaping the future we long for and have not yet experienced. I believe that we are in an imagination battle.” In order to do what the climate crisis demands of us, we have to find stories of a livable future, stories of popular power, stories that motivate people to do what it takes to make the world we need. Perhaps we also need to become better critics and listeners, more careful about what we take in and who’s telling it, and what we believe and repeat, because stories can give power – or they can take it away. To change our relationship to the physical world – to end an era of profligate consumption by the few that has consequences for the many – means changing how we think about pretty much everything: wealth, power, joy, time, space, nature, value, what constitutes a good life, what matters, how change itself happens. As the climate journalist Mary Heglar writes, we are not short on innovation. “We’ve got loads of ideas for solar panels and microgrids. While we have all of these pieces, we don’t have a picture of how they come together to build a new world. For too long, the climate fight has been limited to scientists and policy experts. While we need their skills, we also need so much more. When I survey the field, it’s clear that what we desperately need is more artists.” What the climate crisis is, what we can do about it, and what kind of a world we can have is all about what stories we tell and whose stories are heard. Climate change was a story that fell on mostly indifferent ears when it was first discussed in the mainstream more than 30 years ago. Even a dozen years ago, it was supposed to be happening very slowly and in the distant future. There were a lot of references to “our grandchildren’s time”. It was a problem that was difficult to grasp – this dispersed, incremental, atmospheric, invisible, global problem with many causes and manifestations, whose solutions are also dispersed and manifold. That voices from the climate movement have finally succeeded in making the vast majority understand it, and many care passionately about it, might be the biggest single victory the movement will have. Because once you’ve won the popular imagination, you’ve changed the game and its possible outcomes. But this was a long, slow, arduous process, and misconceptions still abound. A lot of people don’t know that we’ve largely won the battle to make people aware and concerned. The LA Times ran a well-intentioned editorial last year about how most Americans don’t care about climate breakdown. That was true once, but no longer is. A Pew Research poll in 2020 concluded that two-thirds of Americans wanted to see more government action on climate, but last summer the scientific journal Nature published a study concluding that most Americans believe that only a minority (37-43%) support climate action, when in reality a large majority (66-80%) does. That gap between perceived and actual support undermines motivation and confidence. We need better stories – and sometimes better means more up to date. Outright climate denial – the old story that climate change isn’t real – has been rendered largely obsolete (outside social media) by climate-driven catastrophes around the globe and good work by climate activists and journalists. But other stories still stop us from seeing clearly. Greenwashing – the schemes created by fossil fuel corporations and others to portray themselves as on the environment’s side while they continue their profitable destruction – is rampant. It’s harder to recognise a false friend than an honest enemy, and their false solutions, delaying tactics and empty promises can be confusing for non-experts. Fortunately, as the climate movement has diversified, one new organisation, Clean Creatives, focuses specifically on pressuring advertising and PR agencies to stop doing the industry’s dirty work. Likewise, climate journalists are exposing how fossil fuel money is funding pseudo-environmental opposition to offshore wind turbines. (As the climate activist and oil policy analyst Antonia Juhasz recently told me, the climate movement is now going after every aspect of the fossil fuel industry, including funding by banks and, via the divestment movement, shares held by investors; donations to politicians; insurers; permits for extraction; transport; refinement; emissions, notably through lawsuits concerning their impact; shutting coal-fired power plants; and pushing for a rapid transition to electrification.) But we still lack stories that give context. For example, I see people excoriate the mining, principally for lithium and cobalt, that will be an inevitable part of building renewables – turbines, batteries, solar panels, electric machinery – apparently oblivious to the far vaster scale and impact of fossil fuel mining. If you’re concerned about mining on indigenous land, about local impacts or labour conditions, I give you the biggest mining operations ever undertaken: for oil, gas, and coal, and the hungry machines that must constantly consume them. Extracting material that will be burned up creates the incessant cycle of consumption on which the fossil fuel industry has grown fabulously rich. It creates climate chaos as well as destruction and contamination at every stage of the process. Globally, burning fossil fuels kills almost 9 million people annually, a death toll larger than any recent war. But that death toll is largely invisible for lack of compelling stories about it. All mining needs to be done with respect for the land and people in the vicinity, but the impact of mining for renewables needs to be weighed against the far more devastating impact of mining for and burning fossil fuel. The race is on to find battery materials that are more commonly available and less impactful than lithium and cobalt, and some of the results look promising. Last summer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced an aluminium-sulphur battery is in the works, while a US company is developing one that stores electricity using iron – the so-called “iron-air” battery. Efforts to extract battery materials from longterm coal waste in West Virginia are among the many others under way. And the Inflation Reduction Act includes funding to research better battery materials and domestic US sources. Other stories of premature defeat are all too common. In the 400,000-strong 2014 climate march in New York City, one section marched behind a huge banner declaring “WE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS” – but many people still believe we do not. We have the solutions we need in solar and wind; we just need to build them out and make the transition, fast. Looking to wildly ineffectual carbon sequestration and other undeveloped technologies as a relevant solution is like ignoring the lifeboats at hand in the hope that fancy new ones are coming when the ship is sinking and speed is of the essence. One story I frequently encounter frames the possibilities in absolutes: if we can’t win everything, then we lose everything. There are so many doom-soaked stories out there – about how civilisation, humanity, even life itself, are scheduled to die out. This apocalyptic thinking is due to another narrative failure: the inability to imagine a world different than the one we currently inhabit. People without much sense of history imagine the world as static. They assume that if the present order is failing, the system is collapsing, and there is no alternative. A historical imagination equips you to understand that change is ceaseless. You only have to look to the past to see such a world, dramatically different half a century ago, stunningly so a century ago. The UK, for example, ran almost entirely on coal power until the 1960s, and if you had said then that it would have to quit coal, many would have imagined this meant an utter collapse of the energy system, not its transformation. Even in 2008, the organisation Carbon Brief noted, “four-fifths of the UK’s electricity came from fossil fuels. Since then, the UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy. Coal-fired power has virtually disappeared and even gas use is down by a quarter. Instead, the country now gets more than half of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear.” Scotland already generates nearly all the electricity it needs from renewables. While I often hear people casually assert that our world is doomed, no reputable scientist makes such claims. Most are deeply worried, but far from hopeless. There are already profound losses, but our action or inaction determine how much more loss will occur, and whose it will be, and some repair is possible. Efforts sufficient to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lower temperatures and reverse some aspects of climate breakdown. Even the journalist David Wallace-Wells, who rose to fame with a deeply pessimistic book about climate a few years ago, has shifted his view. He currently describes a future somewhere between the best and worst case scenarios, a future “with the most terrifying predictions made improbable by decarbonisation and the most hopeful ones practically foreclosed by tragic delay. The window of possible climate futures is narrowing, and as a result, we are getting a clearer sense of what’s to come: a new world, full of disruption … yet mercifully short of true climate apocalypse.” A climate story we urgently need is one that exposes who is actually responsible for climate chaos. It’s been popular to say that we are all responsible, but Oxfam reports that over the past 25 years, the carbon impact of the top 1% of the wealthiest human beings was twice that of the bottom 50%, so responsibility for the impact and the capacity to make change is currently distributed very unevenly. By saying “we are all responsible”, we avoid the fact that the global majority of us don’t need to change much, but a minority needs to change a lot. This is also a reminder that the idea that we need to renounce our luxuries and live more simply doesn’t really apply to the majority of human beings outside what we could perhaps call the overdeveloped world. What is true of Beverly Hills is not true of the majority from Bangladesh to Bolivia. When it comes to who’s harming the climate, it’s also been popular to focus on individual contributions. The fossil fuel industry likes the narrative of personal responsibility as a way to keep us scrutinising ourselves and one another, rather than them. They’ve promoted the concept of climate footprints as a way to keep the focus on us and not them, and it’s worked. Usually if I ask people what they’re doing about the climate emergency, most will talk about what they’re not consuming or doing – but these will never add up to the speed and scale of change needed to change the system. One of the goals of system change is to supersede individual virtue. Just as you no longer have to opt in to buying a car with seatbelts or ask for the no-smoking section on the train or restaurant, at some point in the near future you won’t have to opt into travelling in an electric car or bus, or living or working in all-electric buildings. Electrification will have happened because of the collective action that takes shape as policy and regulation. Last year, the veteran environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a brilliant analysis pointing out that if you have money in one of the banks funding fossil fuels – especially, in the US, Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, and Bank of America – your retirement funds or savings account may have a much larger climate footprint than you do. The impact of your diet and how you get to work may pale in comparison to the impact of your money in the bank. The vegan on the bicycle may still be contributing to climate chaos if her life savings are in a bank lending her money to the fossil fuel industry. Individual impact, leaving the ultra-wealthy aside, matters mostly in the aggregate. And in aggregate we can change that. On 21 March, McKibben, via his new climate group Third Act (on whose advisory board I sit), and dozens of other climate groups will be organising actions by people with money in, or credit cards from, the key US banks, to try to force those institutions to stop funding fossil fuels. Our greatest power lies in our roles as citizens, not consumers, when we can band together to collectively change how our world works. Various campaigns around the world have focused on fossil finance, with significant successes behind them, and much more to achieve ahead. The climate movement has become far more sophisticated and precise in its targets in recent years. It’s doing a brilliant job; it just needs enough people and resources behind it to be more powerful than the status quo. Last year, I took three activists who were formerly part of the Sunrise Movement, a youth group campaigning to address climate breakdown, to see the 1991 film Terminator 2 at a cinema. The film was as great as I remembered, not least because the lead character, Linda Hamilton playing a ferocious young mother, chooses as her motto “no fate but what we make”. In that movie, the future has come back to meddle with the present through the sci-fi technologies of time travel and robot-warrior terminators. We see how actions in the present shape the future through tremendous battles over what that future will be. This is, of course, just as true in real life. We don’t get terminators and other time-travellers to tell us what the consequences of our actions are, but they still have consequences. You ban the insecticide DDT, and a lot of bird species stop dying out. You ban chlorofluorocarbons, and the hole in the ozone layer stops growing. In another way, Terminator 2 is less useful as a lens for thinking about the climate crisis. It’s part of the conventions of storytelling in film – and comics, fiction, graphic novels and too many news narratives – that tells us that the world can only be saved by exceptional individuals, often loners, whose gifts are often the capacity to inflict and endure extreme violence. Linda Hamilton and co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot, clobber, crush, outrun and outfight everything thrown at them, and that’s their celebrated skillset, along with a bit of dry humour. Humour aside, this has little to do with how the world really gets changed most of the time. The skills of real-world superheroes are solidarity, strategy, patience, persistence, vision and the ability to inspire hope in others. The rescuers we need are mostly not individuals, they are collectives – movements, coalitions, campaigns, civil society. Within those groups there may be someone with an exceptional gift for motivating others, but even the world’s greatest conductor needs an orchestra. One person cannot do much; a movement can topple a regime. We are sadly lacking stories in which collective actions or the patient determination of organisers is what changes the world. Another thing we get from our films and fictions is the expectation of a single solution and a clear resolution to our problems: a sudden victory, a celebration, and the trouble is over. The climate crisis does not fit easily into this format. Ceasing to extract and burn fossil fuel is central, but there is no single solution. Protecting carbon-sequestering peat bogs, forests and grasslands also matters; so does transforming high-impact materials such as cement; implementing better design for buildings, transport and cities, and addressing soil conservation, farming and food production and consumption. There are milestones and important goals, but the familiar Hollywood ending – crossing the finish line to wrap up the story – doesn’t describe this reality. Change often functions more like a relay race, with new protagonists picking up where the last left off. In 2019, a Berkeley city councilwoman decided to propose banning fossil-gas connections in new construction, and it was passed by the council unanimously. This small city’s commitment to all-electric new buildings could seem insignificant, but more than 50 other California municipalities picked it up, as did the city of New York. The state of New York failed to pass a similar measure, but Washington state succeeded, and the idea that new construction should not include gas has spread internationally. Such relay races have long been how human rights campaigns work: a good protest, campaign, or even piece of legislation can introduce new ideas that do their own work in the world at large. Even failed campaigns may succeed in opening the path for later change. The Green New Deal did not pass in the US Senate, but it became a template for the Biden administration’s climate legislation, and shifted the conversation about what is possible. It led the way to the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate bill the US has ever passed. Opponents of environmental action often say it is killing jobs; the Green New Deal did a lot to change that story by portraying climate action as a job creator. Recognising the reality of climate breakdown means recognising the interconnectedness of all things. That connection brings obligation: to respect nature, to build domestic regulation and international treaties that protect what’s needed, to limit the freedom of the individual in the name of the wellbeing of the collective. This is, of course, a worldview in direct contrast with free-market fundamentalism and libertarianism. Even the facts of climate science are ideologically offensive to people committed to individual freedom without accountability, let alone the demands created by treaties and regulations. Responsibility and obligation are dismal words in mainstream culture, so perhaps there will be other stories that recognise this process as reciprocity and relationship, in which we give back, in gratitude and respect for all the Earth does for us. Even short of that, we can recognise our self-interest in maintaining the system on which life depends. If news is the daily report on what’s just happened, we need a way of pulling back from individual events, to see the broad context of how it happened. If you only tell short-term stories, it all becomes kind of meaningless. Martin Luther King Jr said: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” We’ve seen it bend a lot of ways in recent years, toward and away from justice, but it takes time just to see it bend at all. You need benchmarks or memories of how things used to be even to see change of any kind, including climate change. The South Pacific climate activist and poet Julian Aguon recently declared that Indigenous peoples “have a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory, and just might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect – for the Earth and for each other”. That emphasis on collective memory suggests that a strong sense of the past allows for a strong sense of the future, that remembering difficulty and transformation equips us to face them again. One of the things that buoys me up is the long arc of change in renewable technology. Mostly what you see in the news about renewables is short-term: stories on the latest drop in price, or proliferation of solar and wind over the past year or two. If you enlarge your time frame, you see that those annual changes have amounted to an astonishing plummet in prices and rise in efficiency and global use, compounded by innovations in materials and storage. Twenty years ago we did not have constructive ways to leave the age of fossil fuel behind. Now we do. And the solutions keep getting better. In 2021, the organisation Carbon Tracker put out a report that showed current technology could produce 100 times as much electricity from solar and wind than current global demand. The report concludes: “The technical and economic barriers have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political.” At the end of the last millennium, those barriers seemed insurmountable. The change is revolutionary, but the revolution was too slow to be visible to most. The report continues: “At the current 15-20% growth rates of solar and wind, fossil fuels will be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050. The unlocking of energy reserves 100 times our current demand creates new possibilities for cheaper energy and more local jobs in a more equitable world, with far less environmental stress.” We tend to think utopias are unbelievable, but this is a sober-minded thinktank focused on climate and energy politics. The report made little impact on the general public. Because the energy revolution has been incremental, there’s been no single breakthrough moment. Yet it adds up to an encouraging, and even astonishing narrative. On the other hand, people find grim narratives all too believable, whether or not they are grounded in fact. We are still inundated by harmful, as well as untrue, stories about climate and the future. Prophecies can be self-fulfilling: if you insist that we cannot possibly win, you pit yourself against the possibility of victory and the people trying to achieve it. There’s yet another narrative that’s persisted at least since the invention of compact fluorescent lightbulbs and the Toyota Prius: that we must renounce abundance and enter an age of austerity. It’s all in the telling. To consider our age an age of abundance, you have to be counting sheer accumulated stuff and ignoring how it is distributed. That is, we live in an age of extreme wealth for some, and desperation for the many. But there’s another way to count wealth and abundance – as hope for the future, safety and public confidence, emotional wellbeing, love and friendship and strong social networks, meaningful work and purposeful lives, equality and justice and inclusion. Early on, we heard that renewables were very expensive – this was part of the austerity narrative, or an excuse for not making the transition. But improvements in design and economies of scale are among the factors making them the cheapest form of electricity almost everywhere on earth. There’s no reason to think the innovations of design and economic improvements are all behind us; I suspect they’re mostly ahead of us. Engineer and energy expert Saul Griffith recently wrote: “Most people believe a clean-energy future will require everyone to make do with less, but it actually means we can have better things.” The old story was that we couldn’t afford to do what the climate emergency required. The new one is that it would not only be ecologically devastating, but more expensive not to. Renewables are on the way to being cheaper than fossil fuel; in many places, they already are. Texas and Iowa get a huge amount of their electricity from wind because it makes economic sense, not because these red states are passionate about addressing the climate crisis. Over their lifetime, electric cars work out to be cheaper than internal combustion cars because charging and maintaining them is cheaper. And of course these two examples don’t include the indirect effects of burning fossil fuels on human health and the climate. A lot of people tend to measure climate action in terms of huge national or international news events, but the change that matters is often happening at local and regional and other levels. A university divests; a state sets a date for ending the sale of new petrol cars; a city passes a measure mandating all-electric new buildings; ground is broken on a major solar installation; a state or country sets a new record for percentage of wind power in its energy mix; a pipeline or gas terminal or drilling site gets cancelled; a carbon-sequestering forest or peat bog gets protected status; a coal plant closes. This does not erase all the bad news, about continuing breakdown of natural systems and its toll on human lives and impact on a livable future, but it does contextualise them as crises we can respond to if we choose to. So much is happening, both wonderful and terrible, and it adds up to more stories than almost anyone can take in. But the overarching frameworks in which we receive them matter, and so do the critical skills to recognise, choose, and change stories. The climate crisis is a problem with no single solution, but many, just as there is no one saviour, but many protagonists in the struggle. In 2019, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said we must embrace “cathedral thinking”, adding: “We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.” The speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler included this passage in one of her essays: “OK,” the young man challenged. “So what’s the answer?” “There isn’t one,” I told him. “No answer? You mean we’re just doomed?” He smiled as though he thought this might be a joke. “No,” I said. “I mean there’s no single answer that will solve all of our future problems. There’s no magic bullet. Instead there are thousands of answers – at least. You can be one of them if you choose to be.” This is an edited version of a speech given at Princeton University in November 2022","‘If you win the popular imagination, you change the game’: why we need new stories on climate",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/12/rebecca-solnit-climate-crisis-popular-imagination-why-we-need-new-stories

If its construction goes to plan, a €2.5 billion (£2.18 billion) undersea pipeline will convey “green hydrogen” from Spain to France from 2030. In the US, some power stations are being upgraded to allow hydrogen to be blended with fossil gas, and the Norwegian oil company Equinor is teaming up with Thermal SSE to build a 1,800 megawatt (MW) “blue hydrogen” power plant in Britain. Meanwhile, China unveiled a plan in March which includes deploying 50,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2025 and early December saw the first hydrogen-fuelled tractors and forklifts leave the assembly line at a new plant in Guangdong province. Hydrogen is produced in multiple ways. A colour spectrum is used to render it simple. “Grey” and “brown/black” hydrogen come from fossil gas (methane) and coal (brown or black coal) respectively – a process that, for every tonne of hydrogen, emits between ten and 12 tonnes of CO₂ for grey hydrogen and 18 to 20 for brown. “Blue” is the same process except the carbon dioxide is supposed to be captured and stored underground. And “green” hydrogen is conventionally defined as generated from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. But only 0.04% of hydrogen is green, and blue hydrogen is less than 1%. The rest is grey or brown, most of which is used in oil refineries and for manufacturing ammonia and methanol. It’s an enormous industry which emits more CO₂ than all of Britain and France combined. It is widely hoped that a silver lining of today’s high gas prices will be green hydrogen becoming a cost-competitive alternative to dirty fuels in boilers, shipping tankers and steelworks furnaces. Unfortunately, without electricity market reform, this opportunity is likely to be squandered. And while the buzz around the hydrogen economy intensifies, a closer look suggests the fuel is less a spearhead for a green transition and more the subject of an elaborate bait-and-switch operation by oil companies. Hydrogen’s true colours Green hydrogen is essential for decarbonisation: to replace fossil fuels in steelmaking, ammonia production for fertilisers and possibly shipping and trucking – processes which are difficult to electrify. Some green hydrogen is crosshatched with dirtier hues. So it’s not simply that in its production a lot of energy is wasted in the double transformation from electricity to gas and then fuel. But burning hydrogen also emits nitrogen oxides, air pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain. If green hydrogen production is scaled up to play a significant economic role by 2050, its freshwater demand will exceed one-quarter of today’s global annual consumption, risking water scarcity in some regions. Above all, hydrogen is meaningfully green only if the renewable energy that generates it cannot be fed into the grid to replace power from gas or coal plants. Blue hydrogen relies on a similar – but much more harmful – trick of the light. For hydrogen to be true blue, the emissions must be captured and securely stored. In theory, carbon capture and storage works but nearly all plants use the captured carbon to pump more oil and many have been shut down as failures. Only a handful store carbon indefinitely and even these consume lots of energy and capture only some of the CO₂, which can leak. Blue hydrogen’s main source is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is notorious for escaping drilling wells and pipelines. Research suggests that these issues make blue hydrogen worse for the climate than fossil gas. In the EU, as in many economies, electricity pricing is based on the principle of marginal costs, which means that the most expensive source (typically fossil gas) sets the wholesale power price. During sunny or windy spells, a glut of renewable energy generation can slash electricity prices, freeing them from the grip of natural gas prices for a few hours at a time. This is often not enough to justify investments in the electrolysers which produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen won’t gain the necessary price advantage over blue hydrogen and fossil gas until electricity markets are restructured. Meanwhile, the high price of oil and gas has turbocharged the industry’s expansion. The US government is exhorting oil and fracking firms to “drill baby drill”. Britain’s government is to award more than 100 licenses to drill for oil and gas and colossal new fossil fuel investments have been announced across the Middle East and Africa. In a few years when these new sources come onstream, and particularly if economic growth continues to slow and depress energy demand, gas and oil will become cheaper again – until the next price spike prompts new rounds of investment, and the infernal cycle continues. The owners of newly-built wells, pipelines and terminals will fight to defend those assets and stall decarbonisation. Now fossil-fuel firms are rebranding themselves as agents of “carbon management.” The aim is to prevent their assets from getting stranded by repurposing them, presenting a largely fictional substance, blue hydrogen, as a low-carbon “bridge” to an unspecified green future. Other sectors have joined the oil-led coalition. As the engineer Tom Baxter observes, gas network operators and boiler manufacturers see their survival in this ploy. Utilities are similarly keen, as hydrogen’s inefficiencies allow them to sell more power. Tackling this stalling operation requires public policy. Governments will need to regulate or tax carbon out of the market while simultaneously ramping up renewables. The approach to electricity pricing also needs to shift, to decouple the prices of electricity generated from renewables and fossil gas. The marginal pricing system hugely benefits renewable project owners, since they profit from high electricity prices and effectively zero input costs. An alternative market structure would set rewards for generators according to their average costs plus a slight surplus which could be reinvested into deploying more renewables and other green technologies, providing consumers with cheap electricity. This can only be achieved through a robustly regulated market or by nationalising energy companies and setting prices and production. These interventions would give green hydrogen a competitive advantage over blue or grey variants, one that could be furthered with other subsidies, such as tax credits on the model of the US Inflation Reduction Act. Above all, energy demand must be reduced to ease upward pressure on price. In any future energy system, hydrogen will have a role. But its expansion must be carefully designed, to prevent the promise of green hydrogen disguising the risks of its blue and grey cousins.

The company, which is part of Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, will begin consultations over 440 redundancies and said it will idle its plant at West Bromwich and convert another in Newport, Wales, into a storage facility. Jobs are also likely to be lost at its Rotherham plant after Liberty said it became “unviable” to produce cheaper steel products, “due to high energy costs and imports from countries without the same environmental standards”. The firm will now focus on steel for defence, energy and aircraft-making clients in a bid to regain profitability. Jeffrey Kabel, Chief Transformation Officer for Liberty Steel Group said: “While our action is expected to regrettably impact the roles of some of our workforce we will provide a level of guaranteed salary and placement opportunities.” He added: “We remain committed to our longer-term growth plans in the UK including our plan to grow Rotherham into a 2 million tonne green steel hub.” Cheap imports from China, where European producers say lax pollution regulations make the material cheaper to make, are squeezing margins on cheaper steel products such as the thick rebar staves used to reinforce concrete in the construction industry. But Britain is also at a disadvantage to European producers, according to UK Steel, the industry group. It estimates that German producers will pay £107 per megawatt hour of electricity in the coming financial year compared to £174 for UK steel mills. Electric furnaces are seen as the future of many UK steel mills as wind power becomes an increasing part of power supply. The steel sector employs 34,500 people directly in the UK and supports a further 43,000 in supply chains. The jobs are often in areas with few other skilled careers and they offer a salary averaging £37,629, 45pc higher than the UK national average. Alun Davies, Community steelworkers' union national officer, said: “This announcement is a body blow to Liberty Steel’s loyal UK workforce, who couldn’t have done more to get the company through an exceptionally challenging period.” Liberty Steel, the UK’s third-largest steel maker after Tata and British Steel, employs 1,900 people in the UK as well as 5,000 contractors. It said Rotherham could lose 185 jobs, while 121 were at risk in Newport, where the company makes thin plates of steel known as hot rolled coil. West Bromwich could lose 99 jobs, and 35 could be lost in Tredegar in South Wales. Both sites make steel tubes. Liberty was hit by the collapse of Greensill Capital from which it borrowed $5bn (£4.1bn). Mr Gupta’s businesses had borrowed from ventures founded by Australian entrepreneur Lex Greensill, which loaned money to companies short term. It collapsed after one of its insurers refused to renew cover. In November, Liberty reached an understanding with creditors to Lex Greensill’s former lending empire including Swiss bank Credit Suisse, in what it called a major step in refinancing the troubled businesses.",Liberty Steel to make over 400 staff redundant as energy costs hammer industry,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/12/liberty-steel-make-400-staff-redundant-energy-costs-hammer-industry/

Thursday saw several developments in Britain’s many industrial disputes as it emerged the ambulance union will meet next week to consider six more strike days. Staff at more than 150 universities across the country are demanding that employers push up their offer of a 3 per cent pay rise after more than a decade of below-inflation increases, the union said. “The clock is now ticking for the sector to produce a deal or be hit with widespread disruption throughout spring,” UCU general secretary Jo Grady said. Meanwhile, around 100,000 civil servants have also decided to go ahead with a walkout next month after failed talks with the government were dismissed as a “total farce”. Doctors’ unions told health secretary Steve Barclay that he must address the “workforce crisis” at a meeting on Thursday, during which there was no movement on pay demands, while a ballot of a teacher’s union failed to meet the threshold for strike action. Talks aimed at resolving the long-running rail dispute were also set to continue following meetings between unions and employers on Thursday. Further ambulance strikes loom as figures showed emergency response times had fallen to their worst on record, with more than one in 10 people left waiting for paramedics for more than three-and-a-half hours after calling, including with serious illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of damaging the NHS. Speaking in Belfast, he said: “The most important thing is that these strikes are ended. They will only be ended if the government gets in the room and negotiates and so instead of grandstanding, they need to govern.” Mr Barclay was given a “very clear message” that it would not be enough to focus on next year’s NHS settlement with doctors without a shift on current wages, union leaders said. Representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA), hospital doctors’ union the HCSA, and the British Dental Association (BDA) all met Mr Barclay on Thursday at what was described by both sides as a “constructive” meeting. A strike by 100,000 civil servants will go ahead next month after talks with the government aimed at resolving a bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions broke down. Cabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin met with union leaders to discuss growing industrial unrest after weeks of stoppages across the country, including by Border Force staff over Christmas. Unions had made it clear more money would have to be offered to head off an escalation of stoppages. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), said: “This meeting was a total farce. Despite being well-trailed by the government as a chance to resolve the crisis, it was nothing of the sort because the minister had nothing to offer. “He didn’t deny our members were being offered less than anyone else, he didn’t deny tens of thousands of our members only get a pay rise because of the rise in the national minimum wage but he refused to give us a pay rise now.” Nine out of 10 members of the Nasuwt teachers union in England and Wales voted for strikes over pay but the turnout was 42 per cent, falling short of the 50 per cent legal requirement. Nasuwt general secretary Patrick Roach said the union remains “in formal disputes with ministers and employers and will be continuing to take forward our campaigning for a Better Deal for Teachers. He said: “The readiness of our members to support industrial action demonstrates the anger of the profession and the need for governments in England and Wales to engage in meaningful negotiations to address the deep concerns of our members. “Our campaign to fight for the real-terms pay awards that teachers and headteachers deserve continues.” Leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) met separately with the Rail Delivery Group on Thursday. Both sides said detailed discussions were held and they were working towards a revised offer. Strikes have been held since last summer in the row over pay, jobs and conditions, causing huge disruption to services. No more strikes have been called. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said: “We have been in detailed discussions with the Rail Delivery Group for the train operating companies. We are working jointly towards a revised offer for their section of the dispute. “We’ve agreed that over the next couple of days we’ll continue to work on that through discussions, and we’ll see what comes of it.” Additional reporting by Press Association.",University staff to walk out for 18 days as ambulance workers consider further strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/strikes-ambulance-trains-nhs-teachers-b2261200.html

The James Hutton Institute has signed construction contracts with McLaughlin & Harvey worth £28.7m for the next stage of the ongoing redevelopment of its Invergowrie estate. This new contract comprises the construction of a combined Advanced Plant Growth Centre (APGC) and international barley hub (IBH). The new building – with the APGC downstairs and the IBH above – will be full of the latest state-of-the-art scientific equipment. This will include computing facilities, imaging technology, sensor-based systems, robotics and controlled environmental cabinets for growing plants. The project, funded by £62m from the Tay Cities Deal, is part of a masterplan to create two institute-led innovation centres at Invergowrie. It will help establish Scotland as a leader in global food security and crop resilience. Enabling works are ongoing on-site. A number of older buildings are being demolished to make way for the new facility. It will be built in the heart of the Invergowrie Campus and is due to be completed in early 2024. A ‘significant milestone’ for £62m project James Hutton Institute chief executive Colin Campbell hailed a “significant milestone” for the project. He added: “It aims to futureproof the barley sector across Scotland and the UK. “This new facility will serve as the key research hub. “It is set to bring around £60 million benefit and over 1,200 jobs to Scotland over the next 10 years.” UK Government Minister for Scotland Malcolm Offord said the facility will support “the future prosperity of our farming industry”. He also welcomed the creation of jobs in the region. Mr Offord said: “The UK Government is investing £45m at the James Hutton Institute through the Tay Cities Deal. “These new facilities will undertake vital research that will support food security and the future prosperity of our farming industry, while also creating new jobs for the region. McLaughlin & Harvey’s operations director Robbie Clark said the firm was delighted to be working on the project. He said: “Having recently completed the state-of-the-art Barley Field Centre facilities, our highly experienced project team will now move seamlessly on to the delivery of the new Advanced Plant Growth Centre and International Barley Hub.” Newly filed accounts for its commercial arm, James Hutton Limited, show it made pre-tax profits of over £600,000 for the year to March 2022.

At first, there is often outrage that the usual supremacy of bosses over workers has been suspended. Preserving such hierarchies is one of Conservatism’s main aims. But then there is sometimes a sense of opportunity: a belief that the strikers and their supporters may fall into a familiar trap, set by decades of anti-union legislation and press propaganda. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have believed that strikes can be used to make Tory governments look tough, and to discredit Labour and the wider left. The succession of aggressive, deliberately provocative anti-strike measures announced over the last six months by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak all reflect an assumption that taking on the unions is one of the few remaining strategies that might get the Conservatives re-elected. Yet there is also a third, almost forgotten Tory approach to strikes. Before the Thatcher government, her predecessor as Conservative premier, Edward Heath, faced with strikes that, like today’s, were highly disruptive and yet had considerable public support, was sometimes forced to negotiate and make concessions. As the leader of an unpopular government presiding over a fragile economy that the strikes were weakening further, Heath reluctantly accepted that the unions could not all be beaten. The briefly more constructive tone of some of this week’s talks between ministers and union leaders could be a sign that Sunak, too, will ultimately have to concede at least partial victories to some of the strikers. Like Heath, he is not a dominant or charismatic enough prime minister to change the national conversation about strikes and unions, as Thatcher did. His administration could finally mark the beginning of the end for the version of union-bashing Conservatism she invented, which seems increasingly irrelevant to today’s world of poverty wages and modest union memberships. Alternatively, the industrial relations of Sunak’s premiership could be much messier. Like the party he leads – for now, at least – the prime minister’s political thinking is an unstable, quite possibly unsustainable mix, including a desire to be pragmatic and “reasonable”, a dogmatic belief in markets as the best distributors of economic rewards, and an elite remoteness from ordinary working lives. His government’s attitude to the strikes is to be more conciliatory and more confrontational at the same time. Some strikers may be offered one-off bonuses and better pay rises; others, if they refuse to provide so-far-undefined “minimum service” in sectors from health to education may in future be sacked – despite being participants in walkouts that were democratically agreed and wholly legal when launched. For days now, the government has presented this minimum service legislation as an even-handed measure, to “restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption”. But claiming that a better “balance” between trade unionists and the public is required – rather than acknowledging that in millions of cases trade unionists and the public are the same people – has been a partisan Tory ploy for decades. British life has been tilted against unions since the 80s. And the Tories have never shown any interest in balancing the relationship between the public and other, more powerful and disruptive, but right-leaning, economic protagonists, such as the City of London. The disingenuous and vaguely worded minimum service bill also echoes recent draconian legislation aimed partly at road-blocking climate activists, “to balance the rights of protesters against the rights of others to go about their daily business”. Sunak may present himself as a centre-right technocrat, but partly out of panic at the mounting opposition to his government and Conservatism in general, he is increasingly ruling as an authoritarian. The government insists it supports the right to strike. The business secretary, Grant Shapps – often selected to try to make extreme policies sound moderate – said on the BBC’s Today programme earlier this week that the “ideal outcome” of the bill would be for the government “to have the power” to set minimum service levels “and never have to use it”, because unions would voluntarily set their own. But this scenario is less reassuring than it was meant to sound. If strikes in much of the economy are required to come with their own strike-breaking operations, of a size dictated directly or indirectly by the government, something fundamental to workplace politics has been altered. It’s possible that the bill may never become law, since it seems to contravene protections for unions in the European convention on human rights. And even if the legislation survives challenges in the courts, the Commons and the Lords, and on the streets (the TUC has announced a “national right to strike day” on 1 February) it may be hard to implement. Minimum service levels will have to be defined for a vast range of different workplaces, and then enforced without sacking too many essential staff or creating too many union martyrs. Yet to focus on such difficulties, enormous though they are, is to miss part of the point of this latest attack on strikers. Like many Tory policies since and including Brexit, the bill is meant to be symbolic and divisive as much as practical, to create bogeymen and energise Tory supporters. If inflation falls as expected between now and the election, and the strikers’ pay claims therefore seem less justified to many voters, then a continuing anti-union culture war might be timely. Without a Thatcher, fresh rightwing ideas or much remaining administrative energy, today’s Tories probably can’t run a reforming government that really hurts the left – but they can pretend. The problem with this impersonation of radicalism, though, is that it requires enough voters to be taken in. And Johnson’s drifting premiership, Truss’s shambolic tenure and now Sunak’s tone-deaf performance in 10 Downing Street have removed the Conservatives’ credibility as a governing party. Even the union-hating press hasn’t given the minimum service bill as much coverage as you might expect, which suggests uncertainty about its significance. Half a century ago, as well as negotiating with unions, Heath’s government also tried to weaken them through legislation. The 1970 industrial relations bill eventually became law despite huge protests. But it was widely flouted, and he lost the next election. If you’re a struggling Tory prime minister, victories on paper over the workers probably won’t save you.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded an increase of 0.1% as the services sector remained in growth despite the soaring cost of living. Experts at the ONS said the slight rise was supported by the technology sector and a strong showing by pubs and bars amid a boost from the winter World Cup in Qatar. It nevertheless represented a slowdown in growth after GDP increased by 0.5% in October. Analysts had predicted the economy would shrink by 0.3% for November. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy grew a little in November, with increases in telecommunications and computer programming helping to push the economy forward. “Pubs and bars also did well as people went out to watch World Cup games. “This was partially offset by further falls in some manufacturing industries, including the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, as well as falls in transport and postal, partially due to the impact of strikes. “Over the last three months, however, the economy still shrank – mainly due to the impact of the extra bank holiday for the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in September.” Consumer-facing industries were the biggest growth driver of the month, witnessing a 0.4% increase amid a lift from higher food and drink sales during the World Cup. The service sector also grew by 0.2% as more punters visited pubs and other venues, although this still reflected a slowdown from a 0.7% rise a month earlier. In November, the construction sector saw growth fall away as it stayed flat for the month following a 0.4% rise in October. Elsewhere, manufacturing was the main cause of a 0.2% decline in the production sector for the period. The ONS added that GDP still contracted by 0.3% over the three months to November despite the latest growth. The economy also declined by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2022 and would therefore enter a technical recession if a further fall is recorded for the final quarter of the year. Economists have suggested that the latest data makes it less clear whether the UK will have entered a recession at the end of last year. Kitty Usher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “This is stronger activity than was expected for November and so will further contribute to the improvement in market sentiment we have seen in the last few weeks. “Given we know the economy also grew in October – albeit driven by a rebound from the period of state mourning – it is no longer certain that the economy will meet the technical definition of a recession when the final data for 2022 is in.” It comes as inflation started to cool down in November, dropping to 10.7% from a 41-year-high of 11.1% a month earlier, and it is expected to drop further through 2023. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said: “We have a clear plan to halve inflation this year – an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world. “To support families through this tough patch, we will provide an average of £3,500 support for every household over this year and next – but the most important help we can give is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year so we get the economy growing again.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow Chancellor, said: “Today’s results are just another page in the book of failure that is the Tory record on growth. “The news of further economic pain will be deeply concerning to families already struggling with the soaring cost of living.”",UK economy unexpectedly grows in November,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/gdp-jeremy-hunt-rachel-reeves-institute-of-directors-b2261459.html

In submitting its bid, Forth Ports said it had the potential to create up to 50,000 new, high-quality jobs in renewable energy, manufacturing, sustainable fuels and construction. Its activities will focus on renewables, advanced manufacturing, alternative fuels, carbon capture utilisation and storage, shipbuilding, logistics and the creative industries. The Opportunity Cromarty Firth consortium - backed by Port of Cromarty Firth, Global Energy Group, Highland Resources and Port of Inverness - said it could create 25,000 jobs. The Inverness and Cromarty Firth bid aims to build a ""world-beating"" floating offshore wind manufacturing sector, with sites in the Cromarty Firth, Invergordon, Nigg and Inverness. Also called free trade zones, freeports are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in a zone receive tax waivers or tax breaks on National Insurance contributions, Land and Buildings Transactions Tax, business rates and capital allowances. The Scottish ""green freeport"" model includes commitments to meeting net zero targets and supporting fair work practices. The UK government has committed funding of £52m to the project and bidders had to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. Scotland's deputy first minister, John Swinney, described the creation of green freeports as a ""milestone achievement"". He said: ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport and Forth Green Freeport will support businesses to create high-quality, well-paid new jobs, promote growth and regeneration, and make a significant contribution to achieving our net zero ambitions. ""The successful applicants showed a strong determination to embed fair work practices, including payment of the Real Living Wage, and to enshrine net zero initiatives in their work. ""We look forward to working closely with them to ensure they deliver maximum positive impact and become operational as soon as possible."" The UK government's Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the green freeports would ""undoubtedly be transformative for future generations"". He added: ""Scotland has areas of outstanding opportunity but there are also places that can benefit from more investment to truly level up communities that have been overlooked. ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Firth of Forth are fantastic areas for these new green freeports to set up, ensuring the benefits are felt right across Scotland. ""This will help to create exciting new jobs, boost business and encourage investment in the local areas and beyond."" Scottish Renewables said it was pleased that the freeports would have green energy as a focus. Its head of energy transition and supply chain, Emma Harrick, said they would ""help Scotland compete on the international stage as offshore wind develops to become the mainstay of electricity generation in the UK"". The Scottish and UK governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border, after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later said they would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. The SNP's partners in government - the Scottish Greens - do not support the freeports, arguing they are likely to result in ""greenwashing"" rather than genuine action on sustainability. Greens MSP Ross Greer described freeports as a ""Thatcherite gimmick"" and voiced concern about potential abuse by criminals. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""We've consistently across the world seen freeports attract a lot of criminal activity, particularly money laundering and smuggling, because of the customs arrangements that are in place for them, because they are about deregulation, they are about making it 'easier', particularly for international trade."" Paul Swinney, director of policy research for think tank Centre for Cities, said it remained to be seen how much impact the new freeports would have. He said: ""With freeports, the government has dressed it up as saying we are going to make them into centres of innovation and hotbeds of new ideas. ""But the reality is that the tools that are that on offer make these schemes very attractive to low-skilled businesses rather than high-skilled businesses.""",Cromarty Firth and Forth to host first green freeports,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64248082?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

The Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) bid is a collaboration of more than a dozen organisations representing industry, academia and the public sector around the Easter Ross and Inverness area. The aim is to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity in manufacturing, and from local and inward investment, innovation, skills development and employment. READ MORE: Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport officially confirmed by Scottish and UK Governments The OCF area has been highlighted as the main location for the UK to benefit from floating wind manufacturing. Reacting to the news, HIE’s chief executive Stuart Black, said: “We congratulate Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) on their successful bid. This is fantastic news. “Our collective belief in the region and the key ports’ capacity and capability to play an essential role in offshore wind and green hydrogen delivery has been confirmed by the dedication, commitment and resolve shown by the bid partners. ""This paves the way for even greater industry collaboration. The consortium’s physical assets, natural resources, experienced supply chain, and can-do people have proven to be a winning combination that can lead to future success. “The Highlands and Islands will play a critical role in meeting the challenging net zero targets at both Scotland and UK levels. Green freeport status for the Cromarty Firth will be a huge asset, driving collaboration between industry, academia and the public sector to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity, investment, innovation and skills development. “It will attract large-scale manufacturing and create thousands of green jobs that complement the skills of the local workforce and accelerate Scotland’s and the UK’s progress to achieving net zero targets. “A green freeport will also build on recent significant investments made in ports and harbours across the region and the historic and ongoing strengths here in energy, engineering and life sciences. “It will be a key enabler for supply chains of the future, rapidly accelerating domestic manufacturing capacity in an area with a long-standing industrial heritage. “We very much look forward to our region working in partnership with OCF, as we seek to secure maximum socio-economic impact, not just around the Cromarty Firth and Inverness but throughout many parts of the Highlands and Islands.” Sheelagh Cooley, real estate partner in the Edinburgh office of law firm Shoosmiths, also welcomed the successful bid. She said: “The confirmation of two green freeports in Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Forth represents an opportunity to drive forward new development, regeneration and economic growth in Scotland. “The potential impact of these projects, however, must not be limited to the immediate vicinity of the green freeports. Rather, true success hinges on the ability to also revitalise surrounding towns and cities, many of which are economically deprived. “In Inverness and Cromarty Firth, the introduction of a green freeport is said to have the potential to unlock £2.5bn of new private sector investment – creating up to 25,000 jobs. This is alongside developing wind power technology, with its port facilities already supporting offshore wind projects. “While the introduction of green freeports is governed by UK legislation, the model’s legislative structure is subject to devolved and reserved powers. The sites are intended to be secure custom zones where business can be carried out inside a land border, but where different custom and tax rules apply - offering various regulatory and financial incentives. “From a planning perspective, the green freeports are likely to operate under extended permitted development rights. Combined with a streamlining of the consenting process for development, this type of relaxed planning regime could, in theory, allow schemes – residential, commercial and infrastructure - to be brought forward at speed and avoiding certain barriers. “Unlike the UK government’s freeport model, and investment zone proposals, Scottish green freeports are subject to additional requirements, including on carbon neutrality and paying the real Living Wage. “The Forth green freeport could act as a catalyst for the manufacture of offshore wind turbines, shipbuilding and energy systems. It encompasses several ports, industrial and logistics sites, as well as Edinburgh Airport, with the consortium behind the bid outlining that it could lead to a boom in job creation and economic growth that is rooted in renewable energy and decarbonisation. “The successful bidders will now work with the Scottish and UK Government to determine a governance structure for each site. A process that must balance deregulation and economic growth with protecting the environment and assisting the transition to net zero. “Subject to compliance with the regulatory controls, green freeports should provide a welcome opportunity for growth in the Scottish economy, especially in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.” Dr Liz Cameron CBE, Chief Executive, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, also welcomed the award. She said: “It is great news for Scottish business that the UK and Scottish Governments have finally confirmed the sites of the two winning bids. It’s important now that both governments act swiftly to ensure that the successful sites are operational at the earliest opportunity, we are all competing to attract investment and trade. “Whilst it will be very disappointing for those areas who were not successful, we would urge both governments to now consider, in partnership with the business community, other incentives and initiatives which could be developed from the innovation demonstrated by the other bidders.” Professor Chris O’Neil, principal and chief executive of UHI Inverness, said: “The awarding of Green Freeport status to Inverness and Cromarty Firth will have a transformative impact on the economic fortunes of the community we serve. ""We are poised, together with our UHI partners, to meet the subsequent skills and knowledge demand. “We have the expertise in engineering, research, technology, design and construction to provide a highly-skilled and aspirational workforce, including trainees, apprentices, graduates and researchers. “As well as being well-placed to meet the associated need for talent, we also have the established industry links and capacity for knowledge exchange to make valuable collaborative contributions to the creation of a global green hub. “Our talented and committed students have proved their resilience by studying while coping with the consequences of a pandemic and then a cost-of-living crisis, and this announcement is significant in that it represents an improved future and enhanced opportunities for many of them. “Current and upcoming students will complete their learning journey knowing there is the potential for attractive employment on our doorstep in an expanding industry. These prospects will help retain local talent and will also appeal to a generation of students who are environmentally conscious and willing to embrace a sector that supports their values.” Do you want to respond to this article?

Josh Self,87322068,https://www.politics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PA-68183790.jpg,en,2023-01-13 16:13:37,-0.024,GB,"Rishi Sunak is a hyper-aware, even self-conscious prime minister. Since taking post in October, he has worked assiduously to present a “slick” image to the media, undertaken multiple U-turns to halt backbench rebellions and tried at every turn to position himself positively against Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer. The tricky technocrat in No 10 is obsessed with good press. It is an approach that bares stark contrast to the days of Liz Truss, who showed little concern for how her policies might be received amid her deeply misguided ideological crusade. Unlike his predecessor, therefore, you can take for granted that when Sunak announces a new policy, there will be a hefty amount of calculated politicking involved. In this way, November’s Autumn Statement was strategically orientated to exploit traditional Conservative strengths and traditional Labour weaknesses. Sir Keir, ever-keen to present Labour as a responsible party after the Cobrynite experiment, was challenged to disagree with Sunak’s proposals. In the end, Labour’s inability to sign up wholeheartedly to the new fiscal orthodoxy exposed, in chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s analysis, a deficit of common sense in Labour ranks. When it comes to the government’s new anti-strike bill, the political thinking is essentially the same. Setting a trap… The new anti-strike legislation was introduced to the House on Tuesday by business secretary Grant Shapps. Citing risks posed to NHS patients, Shapps outlined that the new bill would require public sector services to run minimum levels of provision on strike days — essentially forcing a certain proportion of an industry to work or face the sack. The move harks back to a “golden age” of Conservative power over industrial relations. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have viewed strikes as a way to make their party look tough and discredit the Labour Party alongside the wider left. To be sure, we have already seen Starmer encounter some political difficulty in this latest wave of industrial action. In the summer, he chose to sack one-time frontbencher Sam Tarry for standing alongside picketing workers. For the Labour leader — intent on distancing his party from the unions — Tarry had crossed a very literal red line. But even if Starmer wants to downplay the connection, there is no escaping the fact that the Labour party is associated politically and financially with the trade union movement. With the new anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak hopes to implicate Labour in an upsurge of union militancy, thus slowing Starmer’s inexorable march towards Downing Street. It was telling that ministers chose to announce the new strike legislation within hours of the Labour leader’s “New year, New Vision” speech last week. Shapps’ pledge stole Starmer’s limelight and Labour’s newly announced “take back control bill” secured a grand total of zero newspaper front pages the following day. The politics of the new legislation also dominated Starmer’s post-speech press conference. Under a barrage of questioning, the Labour leader confirmed that his party will vote against the plans and repeal the Act if he takes power at the next election. It was all going to plan for Sunak. He had goaded Starmer out of hiding and forced the Labour leader to share an ideological platform with that favourite Conservative bogeyman: the so-called union “baron”. The PMQs’ attack lines wrote themselves. However, few would deny that the prime minister is playing a high-stakes political game with his new anti-strike bill. Although Starmer’s reaction could be accounted for, the government risks running into a hostile public backlash. Now a week on from when the legislation was announced, and many view the new proposals as needlessly and deliberately obstructive. Risk 1: The government is viewed as needlessly obstructive Although Conservative MPs imagine Mick Lynch as the new Arthur Scargill, the infamous union “baron” who led opposition to Margaret Thatcher, the general public is not so convinced. Instead, the political posturing around the new anti-strike bill may be viewed as deepening the industrial relations crisis and prolonging our winter of discontent. Furthermore, the new bills’ parliamentary progress is set to be slow, with a difficult House of Lords stage beckoning. And when/if the bill does eventually pass, its key provisions will unquestionably be tested in the courts before they can take effect, just as is the case with deportations to Rwanda. So with the proposed legislation unlikely to do anything to solve urgent disputes, the public may well wonder want the point is at all — if not to be deliberately coercive and punitive. Risk 2: Labour exploits support for striking nurses Another risk for Sunak is that by focussing on risks posed to NHS patients during the strikes, he ventures onto territory where the Labour Party is traditionally at its strongest. It is telling that Starmer has focused his attacks on the part of the bill which would allow employers to sack workers who defy a “work notice” by striking. At PMQs on Wednesday, Starmer accused the government of going from “clapping the nurses to sacking the nurses”. On Thursday came a new widely-shared graphic by order of Labour Party HQ, which accused Sunak of planning to give striking nurses “the finger”, Alan Sugar-style. This attack line works because it is not very far from the truth. As a result of the proposed law, individual nurses could be prosecuted and even jailed. These are the same people Sunak was pictured clapping for, as chancellor, throughout the pandemic. Risk 3: Sunak is viewed as a rigid, uncompromising ideologue Sunak’s desire to be seen as pragmatic and “reasonable” may be fundamentally undermined by the passage of this bill. In pursuing the new legislation, Sunak has abandoned his “managerialism” and political prudence, territory where the risk-averse Starmer is comfortable, in order to set up a battle over principles, territory where Starmer is not. Honing in on fundamental Labour-Conservative differences in a bid to exploiting the Labour leader’s risk-averse nature, Sunak hence risks exposing the worst aspects of Conservative ideology. While the prime minister may point to a more conciliatory tone in negotiations, there is no hiding that the new law is an act of explicitly Thatcherite homage. It is as provocative and divisive as much as practically possible, drawing on Conservatism’s collective memory of disputes in the 1980s. However, you cannot help but think that in picking a fight with NHS nurses, Sunak has chosen the wrong moment to abandon his “problem-solving” priorities and get dug in with Conservative dogma. One recent YouGov poll found that 64% of the public support the striking nurses. Rather than introducing anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak’s political future may be better served by getting around the negotiating table and constructively ending the industrial dispute once and for all. So with imagery of nurses in handcuffs circling — and with ordinary Britons desperate for some degree of normalcy to return, Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes looks destined to fail.",Week-in-Review: Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes is destined to fail,https://www.politics.co.uk/week-in-review/2023/01/13/week-in-review-sunaks-attempt-to-trap-starmer-on-strikes-is-destined-to-fail/

As energy experts focused on how data can be used in the transition to a low-carbon economy, we have closely followed how this volatility has played out in Britain. Full data for the year 2022 is now available and here are a few things we have noticed. Britain (we talk about Britain and not the UK, as Northern Ireland is part of an integrated Irish electricity grid) saw a 4% drop in electricity demand from 2021 – that’s the third largest year-on-year reduction after 2008 (caused by the shock of the global financial crash) and pandemic-affected 2020. It takes Britain’s overall electricity demand back to values last seen in the 1980s, an 18% reduction from its peak in 2005. This time two years ago, we stated that COVID lockdowns meant electricity demand would never be so low again. We got it wrong. In fact, 2022 was the lowest year by some margin (2% lower than 2020). We believe the main factors for this drop were the significant increase in prices, the wider media attention on this, and the wider cost of living crisis. From importer to exporter The earliest undersea high-voltage direct current cable (known as an interconnector) from Britain to another country’s power grid was laid in 1961 across the Strait of Dover to France. In the years since, another seven have been constructed: two to Ireland, one to Belgium, one to the Netherlands, one to Norway and a further two to France. More interconnectors are under construction or proposed, including a connection with Denmark due to go live at the end of 2023. Since 1978, Britain has always used these cables to import more electricity than it exported over a given year. Over the past decade, an average of 5% of the country’s electricity has been imported, helping to reduce the amount it needed to generate itself. However, net imports swung to net exports in 2022 for the first time in 44 years. Looking at the individual interconnectors, it was the link to France that caused this significant change. In 2021, there were 14 terawatt-hours (TWh) of net imports from France whereas in 2022, there were 10 TWh to France. This is an enormous swing of 24 TWh from a single point of connection, and represents the largest annual change in a single electricity source since the shift from coal to gas in 2015/16. To put 24 TWh in context, this is broadly similar to the amount of electricity Scotland uses each year, or the annual output from Britain’s onshore wind generation. So what happened? Over the past year, French nuclear power stations had many maintenance problems which led to significant reductions in their output. In August, 57% of the country’s generation capacity was not being used. Despite a modest recovery, as of January 2023, 15 of its 56 reactors were closed for repairs. All this meant nuclear-reliant France had to import electricity from neighbouring countries. This led to more electricity being generated in Britain than would otherwise have been the case, to satisfy the additional demand from France. So while Britain’s renewable generation was at a record level, its fossil fuel generation was also higher than in the previous year. Without the problems in France, 2022 could have been the first year that Britain’s wind, solar and hydro combined generated more electricity than its fossil fuels – a milestone that will happen anyway over the next couple of years. Wind is cheap, but your electricity isn’t Wind generation also recovered from its relatively poor output in 2021 to reach a record generation of 77 TWh. That’s a 24% increase on the preceding year, when capacity increased by just 11%. This sudden increase highlights the year-to-year variations that need to be planned for to have a robust and resilient decarbonised power system, including longer duration energy storage. Renewables (including generation from biomass) contributed nearly 40% of Britain’s total generation in 2022. This progress, along with the lower demand for electricity within Britain, meant emissions from the power sector were broadly similar to previous years (though would have been lower if imports from France had continued). The rising prices of electricity and gas have contributed to a cost of living crisis, putting millions in fuel poverty. And though renewables and nuclear together provided over half of Britain’s electricity in 2022, the system is still overwhelmingly influenced by prices set by fossil fuel plants. Reforms are urgently needed here to decouple the price of low-carbon electricity from that of fossil fuels.",Britain is a net electricity exporter for first time in 44 years,https://theconversation.com/britain-is-a-net-electricity-exporter-for-first-time-in-44-years-197506

The Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the BBC's Today programme and the rest of the doomsters may be convinced that we face some terrible economic apocalypse. But the facts refuse to oblige. Confounding all expectations, output in Britain grew by 0.1pc in November, leading financial analyst across the City to upgrade forecasts. That means we're not in a recession after all. And it could get even better when we see the official December data. In spite of all the doom and gloom about a disastrous seasonal shopping season British consumers did what they do best and opened their wallets. The result? Retail sales soared — right in the midst of the 'cost of living crisis'. Growth in November was driven by the UK's resilient services sector — everything from haircuts and shopping malls to the banks and legal services of the City, as well as entertainment and communications. It accounts for nearly 79 per cent of our national output. (Construction was flat, hindered by rising interest rates, while manufacturing dipped.) So in spite of months of bad news from Downing Street in the form of tax hikes and budget cuts — as well as a seemingly never-ending stream of headlines about soaring energy bills, rampant inflation and relentless strike actions — Christmas 2022 brought excellent economic news. From the high street to the retail park, sales were brisk. Shopping boomed across the country, with almost every category in the sector — be it supermarket groceries, beauty products at Boots, or Nike Air Force trainers — keeping the tills rattling throughout the festive period. Marks & Spencer, far from being the busted flush of popular imagination, saw turkeys and sparkling wine help to deliver a 6.3 per cent gain in sales through its food halls. Mid-market Sainsbury's, thought to be a victim of competition from German value retailers Aldi and Lidl, also defied the odds with a 7.1 per cent rise in sales over Christmas. High street giants Tesco, Next and Lidl have all done impressively, too. as have local favourites Greggs and Boots. Corks were also popping at the UK's biggest wine retailer Majestic, where price cuts brought shoppers through the doors in droves. Stunningly, sales were 21.1 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. JD Sports, meanwhile, recorded a 20 per cent lift in sales over the holiday period, driven by 2.6 million pairs of Nike trainers. But it's not just shops. In aviation, passenger numbers at Heathrow were up 90 per cent on the 2021 festive period — when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 blighted festive getaways — defying industrial action by border staff. Elsewhere, in spite of this week's aborted Virgin Orbit launch in Cornwall, the UK's space sector is booming, with Germany's Rocket Factory Augsburg signing a multi-year partnership for a planned launch on the Shetland Islands. The industry generates £16.5 billion of income. And, in another boost, this week's news of a gas find in the southern North Sea by a Shell-led consortium has been hailed as 'fantastic'. The good tidings continue. The Office for National Statistics reported this week that, in 2021, UK output per hour worked 'had the fastest growth of the G7 countries'. Not something likely to lead BBC headlines. Banking giant JP Morgan Chase says that about three-quarters of its mid-size UK business leaders (the backbone of our economy) plan to grow their enterprises this year — and have no plans to shed jobs. So, when all this is accounted for, and despite all the dire talk from the Bank of England and others about the longest recession in our history, things could be turning out far better than expected. And saying this matters. Because drumbeats of bad economic forecasts can fast become self-perpetuating, ramping up the gloom and helping to delay our recovery. Even Doomster-in-Chief — Chancellor Jeremy Hunt — now believes that the economic slow-down will be milder than forecast. So why isn't he — and, indeed, our glum Prime Minister — leading by example and shouting the positive news from the rooftops? After all, it is the Conservative Party's 'energy price guarantee' on people's bills (established under the Liz Truss debacle and largely embraced by Sunak and Hunt), along with targeted help for the poorest families unveiled by Sunak when he was still at the Treasury, that together have taken the sting out of household gas and electricity costs. And that's in addition to the recent sharp fall in the price of wholesale gas, as a result of the extraordinarily mild European winter — one of the warmest in half a century. This has reduced demand and lowered tariffs, further helping to cut the cost of living. Yet despite these successes, Nos 10 and 11 have echoed the pessimistic economists who were still insisting at the end of last year that consumers as well as retailers were bound to suffer badly this winter. The British Retail Consortium's Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said in early December that 'the cost of living crisis means many families might dial back their festive plans'. She could not have been more wrong. It's clear then that, while cost pressures are real, people have not stopped spending. How is this possible? Amid the purported misery, it seems families are still determined to enjoy themselves. My view is that the soothsayers have underestimated two post-pandemic factors. That big savings balances approaching £200 billion, built-up during the pandemic, have been sitting around ready to be spent. And that, ahead of the holidays, fewer credit cards had been swiped to their limits than in previous years. The British Retail Consortium continues to warn that because of further rises in the cost of living, retailers face headwinds in 2023. Maybe so. But inflation is forecast to fall dramatically, wholesale gas prices have tumbled and the employment market remains strong, with more than 1 million vacancies. The pessimism is being overdone. There is still some way to go, but that should not preclude our leaders hailing the resilience of the British consumer, or the skill with which industries across the board managing their way through difficult times.

The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said the new strike days are in addition to the previously announced 16-day programme of rolling strike action, set to begin in schools across the country next week. The EIS Executive Committee met on Friday and agreed action that will include two days of strikes in all schools and sectors on February 28 and March 1, followed by a rolling programme of strikes for 20 days between March 13 and April 21. Each local authority area will be impacted by three consecutive days of strikes, with one day affecting all schools bookended on either side by one-day strikes in primary and secondary schools. EIS members have previously taken three days of strikes, one in November and two in January, in the continuing campaign for a fair pay settlement for the year 2022. Primary and secondary schools were closed on Tuesday January 10 and Wednesday January 11 after last-ditch talks with the Scottish Government failed. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. Speaking after the meeting of EIS Executive Committee, general secretary Andrea Bradley said: “The programme of additional strike action, agreed today, is a direct response to the inaction of the Scottish Government and Cosla (Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) on teacher pay. “After a year of dither, delay and disingenuity from the Scottish Government and Cosla, Scotland’s teachers have simply had enough.” Ms Bradley added: “The recent days of strike action by Scotland’s teachers have succeeded in bringing Cosla and the Scottish Government back to the negotiating table but they have yet to put a single extra penny onto that table. “Scotland’s teachers rejected a sub-inflationary 5% offer six months ago, and little or no progress has been made in negotiations since. “The prospect of 22 additional days of strike action, on top of the 16 days of rolling action set to begin next week, should signal clearly to the Scottish Government and Cosla that they must now act with urgency. “Our members are resolute and determined to secure a fair pay settlement, which both properly reflects their value and also takes account of the soaring cost of living.” Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “Strikes in our schools are in no one’s interest – including for pupils, parents and carers who have already had to deal with significant disruption over the past three years. “It is disappointing that the EIS has proceeded to escalate industrial action – we are continuing to urge teaching unions to reconsider their plans while talks are ongoing. “Recent discussions have been constructive. There has been a shared understanding that talks have been focused on discussing potential areas for compromise – not on tabling a new offer at this stage. “To date we have made four offers, all of which have been rejected, but we remain absolutely committed to reaching an agreement on a pay deal that is fair and sustainable for all concerned.”",Teaching union announces 22 more days of strike action in Scotland,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-government-scotland-children-education-secretary-b2261914.html

The GMB union has written to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, accusing him of ""demonising"" paramedics, call handlers and emergency care assistants who are striking over pay and conditions. Ministers have accused workers of putting lives at risk during strikes. In response, Downing Street said it ""greatly valued"" ambulance workers and the ""door remains open"" for talks. GMB represent more than 10,000 ambulance workers who went on strike on Wednesday across nine ambulance services in England and Wales. Steve Rice, writing on behalf of the GMB Ambulance Committee, said he was ""appalled"" at recent government statements and accused ministers of attempting to remove workers' right to strike . He wrote: ""We feel utterly betrayed by the way your government has singled out ambulance workers as part of a crude attempt to remove our right to strike. ""You and your ministers should be ashamed of the way you have tried to paint us as uncaring about safety standards -nothing could be further from the truth. ""We want a constructive relationship with government - to talk about pay and seriously improve conditions throughout the ambulance service. But you are making us and our ambulance colleagues feel demonised."" Mr Rice concludes: ""please talk to us and stop attacking us."" The letter comes after the prime minister described the industrial action as ""terrifying"". He told the Commons on Wednesday: ""What is terrifying is that right now people do not know whether, when they call 999, they will get the treatment they need."" Business Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs that ""a lack of timely co-operation"" from unions was ""putting their constituents' lives at risk."" Responding to the GMB letter, Downing Street said the health secretary's door remains open to talks with unions and it has accepted the independent pay review body's recommendation to give one million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. A spokesperson said: ""However, we must keep the public safe, which is why we are introducing minimum service and safety levels across a range of sectors to ensure that lives and livelihoods are not lost."" Mr Sunak said he hoped to ""find a way through"" the deadlock with unions to avert further industrial action and touted the minimum service level legislation. The Bill is due to considered by MPs again on Monday. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Ministers know this shoddy, unworkable Bill won't do a thing to help working people or avoid strikes."" Ambulance workers are striking over pay, patient safety and staffing levels.","Ambulance strike: Workers feel betrayed by government, union writes",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64272001?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Astrologists predict it will be a year of hope as the rabbit is a symbol of longevity, peace and prosperity in Chinese culture. The prospect of a better year ahead is certainly something investors in the region will be hoping for. China had a difficult 2022 with tightening tech sector regulations, a property building crisis that curbed investment, and strict Covid-19 restrictions that dampened consumption. As a result, growth levels achieved in the year will likely be significantly below the annual target of 5.5%. At the end of last year Chinese authorities offered some “hope” for growth by terminating its three years of zero-Covid restrictions and lifting almost all constraints that damaged the property sector. These coordinated policy responses led economists to increase their GDP forecasts for the year ahead, with China likely to be the only major economy to grow faster in 2023 than in 2022 (the forecasted growth rate is 4.8 per cent in 2023, against 3% for last year). At the upcoming National People’s Congress in March the government may decide to set a growth target of 5% for 2023. The target needs to be ambitious enough to boost confidence, particularly when growth is deteriorating in many regions. But it must also remain realistic to avoid two consecutive years of growth disappointment. One area of concern is a surge in Covid-19 cases. Since restrictions have been lifted there has been an exponential rise in infections. While accurate data is hard to source, a number of local governments have estimated 60-85% of their population contracted Covid-19 in December. As this wave of infections escalates – with people moving around the country for the Lunar New Year – it will put enormous strain on already pressured hospitals, particularly as medical shortages continue across major cities. The faster-than-expected easing of restrictions will therefore initially be disruptive to the recovery, as shown by recent economic indicators. Nevertheless, with Covid-19 restrictions removed and with continued support for the property market, the Chinese economy should accelerate in the second quarter of the year, especially if the current wave of infections subsides, allowing activity to pick up. That said, a repeat of the V-shaped recovery seen in 2021 after the initial Covid-19 shock should not be expected as the property market will take longer to recover and gain investor confidence. What about inflation? Many economies around the world have had to deal with spiralling inflation throughout 2022, albeit China is the outlier with the most recent consumer price index in December rising at 1.8% (year-on-year). As China advances the easing of Covid restrictions, inflation will potentially accelerate due to pent-up demand and government growth policies. It could easily accelerate beyond the official target of 3% in 2023, similar to what happened in other major economies after reopening. Chinese households are cash rich, demand will be tilted towards consumption, and a decent rebound in retail sales is likely, given the last print in November was a decline of 5.9% (year-on-year). There are already signs of this pent-up demand as bookings for international travel have surged. China re-opening will undoubtedly cause higher inflation, and many western central bankers will be wary of this. However, the impact of that re-opening should have limited impact on global inflation. Whilst there will also be a need for more energy from China; Chinese imports of crude oil and liquefied natural gas are already back to pre-pandemic levels. China is a large consumer of commodities and there has already been a surge in iron ore, up more than 40% since bottoming in late October 2022. Any further resurgence in commodities will depend heavily on how China stimulates the economy, and it is somehow difficult to envisage a resurgence in construction in the short term, which should limit commodity upside. Ultimately the speed of easing of coronavirus restrictions has surprised many, and it seems China is prioritising growth above all else. In terms of prosperity at least, the Year of the Rabbit may well bring some welcome respite.

It wasn’t until this past year watching Musk, Johnson, Trump, King Charles, Truss, Clarkson (who is not out of the woods, however much cover The Sun give him) etc that it occurred to me that, if you are patient enough and prepared to witness massive collateral damage and waste of resources and unnecessary heartache, worsening socio-economic inequality and the debasement of living conditions for the most vulnerable – “they” implode...

Rishi Sunak has been warned that his “high risk” strategy on public sector pay rises could backfire, as an exclusive poll for The Independent showed strong public support for fresh strikes in 2023. Almost two in three voters would back NHS nurses taking more strike action next year if their pay demands are not met, the Savanta poll found, with only 24 per cent opposed. In addition, more voters expressed support for fresh industrial action by rail staff, bus drivers, postal workers and teachers than those who said they were opposed to further strikes. Adam Forrest reports: What does Britain really think about the strikes? As unions and government continue their stand-off, voters are still backing the workers who have chosen to walk out, polling finds – and they support more strikes in the new year, Adam Forrest reports Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 02:48 1672796880 As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be a good year for the unions After decades when it was – sadly – usually safe to ignore the pronouncements of union leaders, the most widespread outbreak of industrial action since 1979 has meant that they are household names once again. Not yet as familiar as, say, Mick Lynch, is the brand new general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, who formally takes over from Frances (now Baroness) O’Grady on 1 January. He is, though, making a somewhat loud entrance. He told The Independent that the strikes could carry on throughout 2023 if the government refuses to negotiate over pay rises. If we take ministers at their word, that they won’t do so until at least the new public pay body recommendations arrive in April, then the country is in for a prolonged period of conflict. Writes Sean O’Grady: As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be good for the unions The economic reality is on the side of the unions, and Rishi Sunak lacks Thatcher’s sharp political instinct, writes Sean O'Grady Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 01:48 1672793280 I’m a nurse – this is why I voted to strike Ever since I was a young child, I dreamt of being a nurse that worked for the NHS. Twelve years ago, after lots of hard work and determination, I achieved that goal. There were lots of sacrifices from my family, who supported me throughout my course. I currently work as a deputy sister in an NHS hospital in Lincolnshire. My role is as part of an acute cardiology team that has face to face contact with patients that attend the hospital after having heart attacks and following cardiac arrests.

Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 23:34 1672786137 Who is striking this winter and why? Workers in several of Britain’s key service sectors are striking in what is being called the new “winter of discontent” as cost of living pressures clash with below-inflation pay offers. Many strikes, such as that of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), have been going on for months, with warnings union members will vote to take their fight far into 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the highest monthly total since November 2011 saw mass public sector walkouts over pension reforms. Liam James reports: Who is striking this winter and why? Workers are walking out in droves over the coming weeks Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 22:48 1672783170 Bus strikes planned for Wednesday TfL has said that strike are planned for Wednesday and Thursday on Abellio bus services. On the strike days, TfL writes that they intend to run as many services as possible, but expect disruption. Routes affected by the strikes are, for the most part, in west and south London. Other bus services will not be affected.

The wild salmon is one of Scotland’s most iconic species, earning its place alongside the red deer, the golden eagle, and the Scottish wildcat. But, like so many other animals, its numbers have been in decline for decades. The population of wild salmon is diminishing on the west coast of Scotland, and even faster on the east coast. Reasons for the fall are many and varied, but a key cause is habitat loss and rising river temperatures, due to climate change. The Scottish Government has also identified other pressures facing wild salmon, including predation by fish, birds and seals, as well as the non-native plans that erode riverbanks. Man-made barriers to migration, such as weirs and bridge foundations, lead to further challenges for the fish, impeding their migration to spawning grounds and increasing the likelihood of them being eaten. The sad truth is that a wild Atlantic salmon now has a miniscule survival rate of only around 1-2%. That contrasts sharply with farm-raised salmon, where the survival rate is around 85% over their two years in the cold seas off Scotland’s west coast. Daily animal husbandry from our salmon farmers, supported by the best vets in the land, has developed world-leading expertise in hatching and rearing salmon that thrive at sea. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part There are a handful of vocal activists, often from urban centres far from rural Scotland, determined to shut down salmon farms – which would make 12,000 people unemployed amid a cost of living crisis – who mistakenly believe that this would somehow help wild salmon. They have no explanation, of course, for the fact that wild salmon numbers are declining at the same rate on the east coast, where there has never been any salmon farming. What is needed is collaboration, not confrontation. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part in finding solutions, engaging constructively with the wild fish sector, and taking meaningful action to save wild salmon. They are determined, for example, to share their knowledge and experience to support wild fisheries with restocking. Fortunately, most people in the fisheries and angling sectors in the Highlands and Islands recognise the importance of a healthy, shared environment, ensuring fish can thrive in our waters. People like Jon Gibb, a fisheries manager based in Fort William, get that. He has long championed a constructive relationship between the farm-raised salmon sector and fisheries and angling groups, arguing that “both the farmed and wild salmon sectors have a common interest to thrive in our shared space”. I agree, which is why I’m delighted that Jon has agreed to coordinate our revamped £1.5 million “wild fisheries fund”, which is paid for directly by Scotland’s salmon farming companies. Funding to protect our salmon heritage The Scottish salmon sector has already funded projects to save and restore a historic dam in the Western Isles that assists wild salmon to progress to their spawning grounds, as well as restoration projects across Scotland that will reduce riverbank erosion and provide tree canopy and in-stream cover for young salmon. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks In the coming year, £145,000 will be available to a broad range of organisations and projects. Applications are invited from fisheries organisations, including local angling clubs, fishery boards and other community associations. The revamped fund will prioritise applications of a practical nature, which aim to protect and enhance wild salmon populations and local angling opportunities, recognising that salmon and trout fishing is at the cultural heart of many Highland communities, and provides human health benefits. Projects could include removing migration barriers, evidence-based and authorised restocking programmes, hatchery-based operations using contemporary techniques, such as genetic screening, and freshwater habitat improvement, like spawning gravel creation. Money is also available for improvements to angling facilities, including riverside paths, boats and buildings, as well as initiatives to support young and disabled anglers. Scottish salmon is part of our national story. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks. We recognise that today’s Scottish salmon farming sector enjoys its strong reputation and success partly due to this heritage. It is in all of our interests to ensure that we protect our freshwater and seawater environment so that one of Scotland’s most iconic species can recover and thrive.

Hardies Property & Construction Consultants is currently renovating its offices in the city. Once the offices on Albert Square are ready, bosses plan to have staff from Hardies and its sister company Shepherds working under the same roof. They will be joined by workers from the recently-acquired John Duguid Partnership. Hardies investment in Dundee offices Gareth Cordiner, the firm’s north division managing partner, believes this will make a real difference. He said: “It’s hugely important especially after Covid. We do have a flexible working policy but we’ve found people want to be back in the office and back together. “The amount of information you share from hearing it across the room, it makes a big difference. “From a mental health point of view it’s brilliant. You see relationships building again, so there’s huge benefits.” Douglas Smith, who was appointed Dundee partner recently, added: “We’ll have our one-stop-shop under one roof and that’s really exciting. “It needs to be a more modern way, with collective thinking.” Mr Smith also outlined his ambition for Hardies to become the go-to business for anyone’s surveying requirements in Dundee. “It’s a pretty exciting time for Hardies in Dundee,” he said. “We’ve got a fairly big team that are looking to make giant strides in the Tayside area moving forward. “We’re trying to build the Hardies brand. “In Dundee, we’re trying to make it a one-stop shop surveying service across all disciplines – building surveying, quantity surveying, you name it, we’re doing it. “We’re going to target sectors we want to work in.” Tayside offices crucial for Hardies Mr Cordiner said its presence in Tayside and Fife – the firm also has offices in Dunfermline, St Andrews and Perth – are key to the business. He added: “Dundee and Perth work closely together as the Tayside region. “Historically in Dundee quantity surveying-wise, we’re historically very strong and very well known. “Joining up with the John Duguid Partnership we’re keen that we become the strongest quantity surveying team in Tayside. “I don’t think we’re far off that at the moment.” Mr Smith said the firm’s progress would be based on “considered and selective movement”.",Dundee property firm looking to make &#8216;giant strides&#8217; in Tayside,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/business-environment/business/4001080/hardies-dundee/

On Wednesday, around half of Britain’s railway lines are closed and only a fifth of services are running as tens of thousands of workers at Network Rail and train operators walk out on the second day of a 48-hour strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT).

He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. “We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love.

British wrestler Zack Sabre Jr, who has been vocally anti-Tory in the past, stepped out for a high stakes match at New Japan Pro Wrestling’s (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom 17 event in front of a packed Tokyo Dome crowd. With a global audience tuning in to see former WWE superstar Sasha Banks make her heavily rumoured debut, the 35-year-old grappler took his opportunity to shine a light on the action being taken by the Royal College of Nursing (RNC). Back in November, for the first first time in its 106 year history the RNC voted in favour of strikes, as walkouts affected hospitals across the country with more set to take place on January 18 and 19. Zack has joined those criticising the government over the dispute, and he sent a very blunt message for the Prime Minister as he made his entrance on Wednesday (January 4). Looking straight down the camera, he said: ‘Hey Rishi Sunak! Pay nurses, d**khead! Pay nurses a living wage!’ Zack has a message for the prime minister pic.twitter.com/ECbWf0EX1O— Elijah (@eli1ah) January 4, 2023 Zack Sabre Jr has fans around the world (Picture: Etsuo Hara/Getty Images) Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said last month that the union had ‘no choice’ but to arrange the upcoming strikes. She said: ‘The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January. ‘The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.’ The union is campaigning for a five percent pay rise above inflation to help nurses overcome those real-terms pay cuts, to support nursing staff through the cost of living crisis and recognise their critical skills. There are also record nursing vacancies, with 25,000 nursing staff having quit in the past year, but Mr Sunak previously said while the government was open to talks, a demand for a 19% pay rise wasn’t affordable. He told BBC News NI in December: ‘The health secretary has always been clear that his door is always open for talks – we want to be reasonable, we want to be constructive. ‘We’ve got enormous gratitude for all public sector workers for the job they do, and I know things are difficult right now.’ Got a story?

Al-Quds reported that they had been deported for a range of reasons, including drug abuse, theft, expiration of residency and acting against the public interest. Egyptians are the largest expat group in Kuwait, constituting 24 per cent of the workforce, though that number looks set to reduce as the government works on controlling the labour market and reducing the number of expats across all sectors, particularly within the government. In 2018 Kuwait's Civil Service Commission issued a decree to replace expats in government jobs with Kuwaitis over the next five years. Since then, authorities have rolled out a series of measures aimed at reducing foreign workers in the country. In 2020 Kuwait's parliament said it wanted to reduce the number of Egyptians in the country to ten per cent and introduced a draft law to that effect. In December this year the Kuwaiti government imposed new conditions on Egyptian workers wishing to travel to the Gulf State including a $100 entry fee, an increased work permit documentation fee and a medical examination. READ: Kuwait: death sentence for man who killed woman who refused his advances At the time, Deputy Prime Minister Talal Al-Khaled suspended a 2018 memorandum of understanding which was originally signed to facilitate recruitment between the two countries but did not officially inform Egypt it was being terminated. Four months earlier Kuwait announced that it would lay off 250,000 Egyptian workers and suspend all contracts with non-nationals as 500,000 other Egyptians were already set to lose their jobs. Egyptians have suffered racism in the Gulf country with a video of a Kuwaiti customer slapping an Egyptian cashier two years ago going viral. One influencer called Egyptians ""filthy servants."" Even though they are the largest expatriate group in Kuwait, Egyptians lack employment rights and safety provision. In November last year an Egyptian construction worker was killed in Kuwait allegedly after his colleagues dumped rubbish on him from the third floor after not realising he was below them. A 2015 report on migrant rights found that industry corruption, including overextending project timelines and using cheap materials, put construction workers at risk.

Mr Whelan told PA he felt rail employers and the Government were “playing games” rather than making any serious attempt to resolve the pay dispute. “The situation is getting worse and my members now want to go harder and faster because of the lack of progress. “We are in a weird world where the Government will do anything to keep private companies in the industry. “It is inevitable that more strikes will be held and probably escalate. “The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government.

He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers.

Next, we need to stop seeing education is something that ends at age 18 or that sees university as the only option with more technical education, lifelong learning and apprenticeship,” he said. We're holding the first BUSINESSiQ Awards - to nominate someone, CLICK HERE He told an audience in Stratford: “One of the biggest changes in mindset we need in education today is to reimagine our approach to numeracy. Right now, just half of all 16 to 19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills, is letting our children down.” Rishi Sunak (Image: PA) Grant Glendinning, Chief Executive and Group Principal at Education Training Collective (Etc.), replied: “I fully agree with the Prime Minister, opportunity is intrinsically linked with education – ensuring that learners have access to the best possible learning experiences. However, while maths, and English, are important and critical foundations of any education pathway towards employment, they do not work in isolation. ""Skills as a whole, starting with English and maths, developed from primary into secondary education, supported by additional learning and development in further education or in the workplace as part of an apprenticeship or T Level, are what will see our young people best positioned to take advantage of the careers and opportunities they pursue, supporting the economic growth of our country. Grant Glendinning (Image: Press release) It will be interesting to understand how this will be rolled out, but with the best interests of our learners and our communities firmly at the heart of Etc. colleges, it is difficult to see how enhanced skills development can be anything but a positive.” Zoe Lewis, Principal and Chief Executive of Middlesbrough College, told us: ""The UK is one of the few developed nations that reduces the time spent in education from around 25 hours per week from the age of 5 to 16 years old to around 16 hours per week between the ages of 16 and 18. Zoe Lewis (Image: Press release) ""We would welcome any opportunity to increase the hours available to continue the development of key skills required for life and the workplace in our young people, whether this be mathematics, English, digital, physical education or employability skills. ""Whilst we would not necessarily single out mathematics from the list of priority skills, we would very much support any increase in investment between in the ages of 16 and 18, alongside a clear plan as to how we can develop and train the increased numbers of teachers that would be required, in light of the current shortages across the sector."" Henri Murison, Chief Executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership said businesses needed young people who were ready for work: ""The Prime Minister is right to be concerned about the progress made by disadvantaged children in this country,"" he said. ""It is simply not good enough that 60% of children do not receive a high enough grade at GCSE in maths to make it on to a T-Level course or other vocation routes to further study.

After the disappointments of the previous decade, this was to be the time when the global economy powered up and got going again. There would be a flowering of new technologies and a colossal boom. It would be the roaring 20s all over again. It hasn’t worked out like that. Instead, the world faces the grim prospect of a second recession in three years. The three biggest economies – the United States, China and the European Union, which between them account for roughly half of all global output – are slowing at the same time. That’s unusual and troubling. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, says a third of the world economy will be in recession in 2023, and even for countries that manage to keep growing it will feel like a recession. The IMF has got it wrong – sometimes seriously wrong – in the past but even so, Georgieva’s pessimism is warranted. Just about every indicator of looming recession is flashing red. Prices are rising faster than wages, reducing consumer spending power. Corporate profitability is being squeezed by rising costs and weakening demand. Developing countries that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are now finding their debt burdens unmanageable. The two big asset bubbles of the post-pandemic era – crypto-currencies and tech stocks – both collapsed in 2022. Central banks are raising interest rates, exposing the vulnerability of “zombie” companies that have survived only thanks to a prolonged period of low interest rates. It is a lot cheaper in the US to borrow money for 10 years than it is to borrow money for one year. In the past this unusual phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale sign of a recession in the offing. China hauled the global economy out of its last serious downturn but is in no shape to do so this time. House prices have been rising at double-digit rates for the past three decades but are now falling in many cities because the boom has led to more and more homes being built. Politically, President Xi Jinping cannot afford a house price crash so he can bring demand and supply back into balance only by curbing property construction. That, coupled with the increase in coronavirus cases since the end of the zero tolerance approach to Covid-19, means China is the country to watch in 2023. The IMF says that for the first time since the early 1990s, China will grow less quickly than the global economy as a whole. It could be worse than the IMF envisages. So, the big question is not whether the global economy is in for a rough year in the 12 months ahead, because that is clearly the case. There may be one or two countries that buck the trend, but the UK is not going to be one of them. Another year of underperformance will keep the debate about Brexit alive, even though adjustment to life outside the EU is not the only – let alone the principal reason – for the UK’s current predicament. This is a global rather than a UK-specific problem, and it predates Brexit. Nor is the question why the bounce-back from the Covid-19 pandemic has been cut short, because that too is obvious. The post-lockdown recovery was built on the shakiest of foundations. Shortages led to a burst of inflation, amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks in the west found themselves powerless to combat a cost of living crisis other than by jacking up interest rates. The recessions or near recessions that will be seen in the US, the EU and the UK this year are no accident. They are a deliberate act of policy, which central bankers justify by saying it is a choice between pain now or more pain later. No, the real issue is whether the roaring 20s have been delayed or will never arrive. Put another way: is the global economy facing a temporary, if nasty, period of stagflation (a combination of weak growth and high inflation) or something deeper: a crisis of capitalism? And if it is the latter, what can be done about it? History may well repeat itself. The 1920s began with a pandemic, an inflationary boom and a deep recession. It took a while for better times to arrive, and when they did the driving force was a wave of new inventions, first developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but which took time to reveal their full potential. Techno-optimists say artificial intelligence and biotechnology will be to the 2020s what radio and the motorcar were to the 1920s: the catalyst for a period of markedly faster growth. They believe a period of abnormally lower interest rates has held back a fourth industrial revolution by allowing no-hoper companies to stagger on. A period of creative destruction will see this misallocation of capital end, leading to higher investment in the industries of the future. But the global economy has now been in the doldrums for 15 years. Money has been cheap and plentiful ever since the banks nearly went bust during the global financial crisis. There is not much evidence to suggest that the fourth industrial revolution is being held back by a shortage of capital. Rather, there has been a reluctance by both governments and the private sector to invest. Governments could have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs to rebuild clapped-out infrastructure, but failed to do so. The private sector preferred to use profits to buy back shares rather than taking a punt on new products. Financial engineering proved lucrative for elites, who assumed – quite wrongly – that because the system was working for them it was working for everybody. In one respect, the roaring 20s have already returned. While living standards are being squeezed for the many, for the super-rich it is a new gilded age. Three factors were behind the massive jump in productivity in the middle decades of the 20th century: ideas, investment and the struggle against inequality. Economies only really started to motor when new products were available to the masses through policies that encouraged full employment, collective bargaining and rising wages. Currently, there are plenty of ideas but the other two factors are missing. Until that changes, the global economy will be stuck in its low-growth rut.

It is estimated just 10% of services will be running on one of the worst days of action for decades. Around 12,500 train drivers from 15 firms will take part in the mass walkout. It comes as over the last week we have seen strike action from 40,000 workers on Network Rail and 14 train operating companies who have continued to strike. RMT members were on strike for 48 hours causing travel chaos for people across the UK. But today it is the turn of Aslef – which represents 96% of the train drivers in England, Scotland and Wales – who will continue into their second day of strikes in two days. Rail workers on the picket line at Grand Central Station in Birmingham yesterday (Picture: PA) MORE : What strikes are planned around New Year 2023? Trains, London buses, road workers and more The strike will bring services on affected lines to a halt and comes as more and more people in many different sectors of the economy are withdrawing their labour as employers refuse to help their employees during the cost-of-living crisis. But it’s not the end, as those from The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers are also set to walk out tomorrow and on Friday. It includes train drivers at 15 rail operators and is likely to shut down much of the country’s rail network. On all five days of action, trains will start later and finish much earlier than usual, running between 7.30am and 6.30pm, National Rail has warned. Tickets for 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 January can instead be used the day before the date on the ticket, or up to and including Tuesday 10 January. Timeline of strikes over the next few weeks – January 5 Train workers at 15 operators with the Aslef union to stage a 24-hour walkout. The DVSA strike continues in London, the South East, South Wales and the South West. RPA staff will continue their walkout.

RCN members in England will continue their strike. – January 23 Unison members working for five ambulance services in England will stage another walkout. – January 25 London bus workers at Abellio will go on strike. – January 26 London bus workers at Abellio will continue strike. Train drivers are joined today by London bus workers at Abellio, who are striking for eight days in total this month. Abellio buses have been affected on strike days – with other buses running but busier than usual. The action started back on December 8, but the bus strike dates around New Year included today and yesterday. Dozens of buses in London are going to be impacted by strikes. Rural Payments Agency (RPA) staff will also resume their strikes. Driving tests have likewise been disrupted today – with DVSA driving examiners’ strike starting in London, the South East, South Wales and the South West. ‘We don’t want to go on strike but the companies have pushed us into this place,’ said Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He added: ‘They have not offered our members at these companies a penny – and these are people who have not had an increase since April 2019. ‘That means they expect train drivers at these companies to take a real-terms pay cut – to work just as hard for considerably less – when inflation is running at north of 14%.’ Mick said: ‘The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us. ‘We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing. And that is unacceptable.’ Yesterday TUC (Trades Union Congress) leader Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of ‘underfunding and understaffing’. He wrote: ‘We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. ‘Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. ‘This is simply unsustainable. ‘But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. ‘That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.’ The mass strike action could cause chaos for commuters (Picture: Getty) Driving examiners and supporters picket outside a Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency office in a strike yesterday (Picture: Getty) MORE : Why aren’t the police allowed to go on strike and is any other profession banned? MORE : Brits heading back to work face worst rail strikes yet with five days of action Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: ‘That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. ‘Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. ‘But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. ‘In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. ‘This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. ‘We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love. ‘And so our public services can start to improve for everyone who relies on them.’ RMT general secretary Mick Lynch warned on Tuesday that industrial action will need to continue beyond May unless a reasonable offer to resolve the row over pay, jobs and conditions is made to the union.

The latest statistics on Scotland’s energy production (not oil and gas reserves) showed that over the first nine months of 2022, generation was up 34.7% compared to the same period in 2021 Final figures for 2021 show that the equivalent of 85.2% of all electricity used in Scotland (total generation minus net exports) came from renewable sources. Due to slightly better weather in 2021 this was actually a slight decrease, but has bounced back up again with the 2022 figures. The energy that is generated in Scotland is exported into the UK National Grid. Consumers in Scotland then buy it back. The further north you go in Scotland the tariff paid for buying it back, increases. So although places like Orkney and the massive windfarms in the north of mainland Scotland are producing well over their own needs in renewables, they are also paying the highest prices to buy back their own locally produced power. Scotland produces most of its renewable energy through wind but hydro is also very important. The future with wave and tidal power makes Scotland’s future as a producer of clean energy very bright. Oil and Gas in the UK Scotland still produces large amounts of fossil fuels through its existing extensive oil and gas fields. The income generated from these sources goes into the UK Exchequer. The UK Government is also very keen to open up more oil and gas fields. Figures from the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) The oil and gas industry plays a central role in the economy of the United Kingdom. Oil and gas account for more than three-quarters of the UK’s total primary energy needs. Oil provides 97 per cent of the fuel for transport, and gas is a key fuel for heating and electricity generation. Transport, heating and electricity each account for about one-third of the UK’s primary energy needs. Oil and gas are also major feedstocks for the petrochemicals industries producing pharmaceuticals, plastics, cosmetics and domestic appliances. Wikipedia Click on this link for more information on UK Oil and Gas: North Sea Transition Authority Scotland’s Renewable Production Energy is mostly a reserved power to the UK Government. The Scottish Government has planning power over the development of wind farms as we have seen recently in Orkney (OIC Faray Windfarm Approved by Scottish Government Despite Reporter’s Recommendation to Refuse ) and licences to develop offshore wind. (Islanders Attend Consultation Events for the West of Orkney Windfarm) There is a major expansion of the wind generation sector in Scotland. In the last twelve months, renewable electricity capacity has risen, up 11.7% from September 2021 to 13.6 GW in September 2022. As of September 2022, 397 renewable electricity projects with a capacity of 17.1 GW are being progressed. 3.4 GW of these are under construction, most of which are offshore wind farms off the Moray Firth. 6.8 GW are awaiting construction and 6.9 GW in planning. The generation and use of energy is a complex picture in Scotland. As part of the UK and with a devolved system of government, control over energy is mostly reserved to the London Government. Oil and Gas is a major sector. The UK Government intends to expand both this and Nuclear production. As well as producing energy we also need to use less but as the weather in 2022 was better for renewable generation it also made our homes and businesses harder to heat. Fuel poverty should not exist in a country which generates so much energy – but it does because we do not control the price or have the means to do so. Scottish Government funded schemes to make our homes and businesses more energy efficient are extremely important (more about that here, Home Energy Scotland). But Scotland still relies very much on fossil fuels.

There is a cost to our landscape and seascape. But, in a climate emergency why is the UK Government developing non-renewable energy sources? And where is the hope for Scots struggling to pay their energy bills when they pay the highest rates in the UK to buy back that same power they see being generated where they live?

The Department for Transport (DfT) rejects the accusation, saying ministers have held “polite, constructive meetings” with union bosses. Train drivers employed by 15 rail firms have walked out for 24 hours in a dispute over pay, jobs and working conditions. It is the sixth Aslef drivers’ strike since summer 2022, and is bracketed by 48-hour stoppages by the main rail union, the RMT. Many operators will run no trains on Thursday. Ahead of the walk-out, Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, blamed ministers for triggering the strike. He told The Independent: “We currently have government that seems to want to destroy the railway and put it into managed decline, alienate the workforce, drive passengers off it by increasing fares on a regular basis and causing the problems that are currently there. “We find ourselves in a cycle of – I can only say – corruption, really.

The government’s caused this, the government can solve it.” The Department for Transport (DfT) rejected the comments, saying that the transport secretary Mark Harper and rail minister Huw Merriman had been talking to union leaders about their desire for a thriving railway. A spokesperson for the DfT said: “The transport secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long-term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation, and costing every household an extra £1,000.” When Mr Harper entered office 10 weeks ago, he said his top priority was to end the long and bitter tangle of rail disputes between Network Rail, the train operators and the unions.

They gave S2-S4 Inverness school pupils the opportunity to engage directly with NHS Highland workers and other employers, in a bid to help them make better informed decisions about their future careers. NHS Highland hosted stalls centred around a range of different professions under the health and care umbrella including healthcare science, medical, nursing, dental, midwifery, pharmacy, and adult social care. At each stall teams carried out different interactive “hands-on” activities with young people to provide some experience and educate them about the different services and job roles. Activities showcased included basic life support, clinical skills demonstrations, birthing activities, mental health awareness and dementia awareness with insights into the challenges posed for older adults, and much more.

Danske Bank has revised its previous forecast of a 0.5% annual fall in economic activity in 2023 downwards and now expects output to contract by about 1% next year. It believes the retail sector will be worst affected by recession, shrinking by 4.5% in 2023, more than twice a predicted contraction rate of 2.2% for this year. Conor Lambe, Danske Bank chief economist, said: “The UK economy contracted in the third quarter of 2022 and we think that economic activity in Northern Ireland is also likely to have declined. Output is then projected to fall further in the final quarter of the year and through most of next year, with both economies experiencing a period of recession as a number of factors adversely impact activity levels. “Inflation is expected to decline gradually during 2023 but remain elevated and weigh down on household purchasing power. Consumer confidence is also particularly low and monetary policy is tightening. “Looking forward, and while noting the considerable uncertainty around the outlook, we expect annual output in Northern Ireland to decline by around 1% next year.” But the bank has forecast that the economy will have grown by around 4% by the end of this year, reflecting a relative improvement on the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses and consumers have been hit by rising costs throughout 2022, with inflation prompting the Bank of England to increase interest rates to 3%. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK economy shrank by 0.3% over the three months to October, although there was a rebound in October itself. As well as retail, other consumer-facing sectors such as accommodation and food, along with arts, entertainment and recreation, are also predicted to take heavy hits during 2023. Danske Bank forecast declines of nearly 4% for both sectors. And output for manufacturing companies is also expected to shrink next year, with a 1.1% fall in output, while the construction sector is tipped for a similar rate of contraction. However, slight growth is predicted for the world of information and communication, as well as scientific and technical services.

Children in years 1, 2 and 3, between the ages of five and eight, will be given age-appropriate lessons designed to introduce them to different careers, training and skills, and inspire them about the world of work. The £2.6m initiative will be introduced across 55 education investment areas, or “cold spots”, where school outcomes are the weakest, targeting 600,000 pupils in more than 2,200 primary schools. Pupils will get the chance to meet employers and “role models” from a range of industries, to try to raise aspirations and link learning to future jobs and careers they may pursue. They will be introduced to careers in the green economy, technology, engineering, construction, Stem, creative industries, aerospace, hospitality and healthcare. The Department for Education (DfE) said evidence had shown that children started to form ideas about their future when they began primary school, yet most careers guidance took place in secondary schools. In addition to the primary careers programme, the DfE also gave details of a new requirement for secondary school pupils to be given greater exposure to providers of technical education, so they know about alternatives to a traditional academic route. Under legislation that came into force at the start of the year, schools will be required to give all pupils in years 8 to 13 at least six opportunities to meet a range of providers of technical education, including apprenticeships, T-levels and higher technical qualifications. Robert Halfon, the minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said good careers advice was vital to open up opportunities for young people from all backgrounds and create the future workforce the UK needed. “The changes we are making to boost our careers programme will raise ambitions from an early age for thousands of children in primary schools across the country, while providing opportunities to unlock talent, think about skills, engage with employers and discover different workplaces.” Oli de Botton, a former headteacher who is chief executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company, which will coordinate the primary careers programme, said: “Our new primary programme will bring careers inspiration to children early in their school life by connecting them with role models and showing them how different subjects relate to jobs.” The education charity Teach First will help train primary school teachers in disadvantaged areas where the scheme will be introduced. Dominic Wyse, a professor of early childhood and primary education at University College London’s Institute of Education, said the initiative’s success would depend on how well it was delivered. “It does worry me it could be terribly dull. There’s a real question – will it motivate children, will it motivate teachers, and is it the sort of push that’s needed right now?” Sarah Hannafin, a senior policy adviser for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), whose members mainly work in the primary sector, said it was right that careers education should not be left to secondary schools. However, she added: “All schools must be provided with the resources they need to provide high-quality careers education, but current provision remains underfunded. Schools will find it challenging to meet increasing requirements and expectations with no additional resources to deliver them.”",Children as young as five in England target of new careers programme,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/05/children-young-five-england-urged-think-about-careers

RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: “Curtailing workers’ freedom to participate in lawful industrial action is always undemocratic and we will look closely at what the Government releases. “We will meet with ministers to see their evidence for the pay process. However, only negotiations on our dispute can avert the planned action this month and I urge the Prime Minister to show a renewed sense of urgency, grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses without further delay. “As for minimum staffing, last month’s action was safe for patients because of detailed discussions we chose to initiate with the NHS to protect emergency services and life-saving care. The public respected that and even ministers acknowledged our constructive approach. “Safe staffing levels that are set in law are what we want to see year-round not just in these extreme circumstances. “We’ve long campaigned for governments to be accountable for safe and effective staffing levels in NHS and social care to prevent one nurse being left with 15, 20 or even 25 sick patients. “The evidence is unequivocal – safe staffing saves lives and having the right number of registered nurses on duty has a direct impact on the safety and quality of patient care. Today’s highly unsafe situation is what is driving our members to say ‘enough is enough’.” Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect said: “This hollow invitation ignores the fact that a majority of public sector workers are not covered by a pay review body, including nearly all civil servants. We have been calling for years for this to be rectified, something which the Government has consistently ignored. “These workers have been some of the most harshly treated over the past decade of real-terms pay cuts, and now the Government is signalling its intent to leave them out once again. “Our members have already indicated their willingness to take industrial action and there is nothing in this announcement that will persuade us not to proceed to a formal ballot as planned.” Unison’s assistant general secretary Jon Richards said: “Ministers should focus their time and energy on rebuilding trust and relationships with workers, not silencing and suppressing them. “Minimum staffing levels in the NHS would be welcome by the public and health staff every single day of the week. That could avoid people being left lying in agony on A&E floors or dying in the backs of ambulances. “The NHS is on its knees because of record vacancies. The idea of limiting legal staffing levels to strike days and threatening to sack or fine health workers at such a time shows proper patient care isn’t ministers’ priority. “The Government is picking ill-advised fights with NHS employees and unions to mask years of dismal failure to tackle pay and staffing.” TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “This is an attack on the right to strike. It’s an attack on working people, and it’s an attack on one of our longstanding British liberties. “It means that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don’t. That’s wrong, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal. “The announcement offers nothing more to help with this year’s pay and the cost-of-living crisis. “The only offer of talks is for next year. But we need to resolve the current disputes and boost the pay of public sector workers now. “The Prime Minister said yesterday his door is always open – if he’s serious, he should prove it. He should take up my offer to get around the table to improve this year’s pay and end the current disputes. “There is a world of difference between promises of jam tomorrow with technical discussions about pay review bodies, and proper negotiations on pay in the here and now. “Our public services are already deep in a staffing crisis. But this Government has gone from clapping key workers to threating them with the sack if they take lawful action for a pay rise. It will only push more people away from essential jobs in public services, harming the whole nation.” Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said: “Just when you thought the Government could go no lower, ministers say they’re looking to deal with strikes by making them illegal, rather than negotiate with unions. “PCS members are on strike because they cannot afford the cost of living. We view any attempt to outlaw strikes as an attack on the trade union movement and we will resist that at every stage.” Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said: “This is an empty offer from the Tory government, and a meaningless stunt from Grant Shapps. “Firefighters and other key workers are facing a ‘real-terms’ pay cut, against a backdrop of rising food and fuel prices during the cost-of-living crisis. “Nothing in this statement from Grant Shapps seeks to address the ‘in work’ poverty faced by these workers who kept our public services going during the pandemic. “They were the Covid heroes. “This grandstanding from Grant Shapps is badly misjudging the public mood. “The Government should call off all pay cuts and we’ll call off strikes. “Grant Shapps should stop telling workers to accept falling real wages.” Claire Sullivan, director of employer relations and union services at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Imposing new anti-strike legislation in a country which already has some of the most onerous strike laws in Europe is unnecessary, weak and unworkable. “The Government is well aware that the proposed ‘voluntary agreements’ in the NHS are already in place due to health workers’ commitment to providing ‘critical to life’ cover. “The way for the Government to avoid current and future workplace disputes is through ongoing, meaningful dialogue and by working in partnership with trade unions. The CSP and other health unions have been warning of the developing NHS crisis for a decade and calling for urgent pay talks for several months, only to be met repeatedly by a complete block from Government.”",Government pressing ahead with ‘minimum safety levels’ legislation,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/unions-government-grant-shapps-nhs-prime-minister-b2256705.html

The official government forecasts from HM Treasury show a fall in UK economic output (gross domestic product, GDP) of 0.8 per cent in 2023. The Scottish Fiscal Commission are predicting a 1.2 per cent fall in Scottish economic output. There are no official forecasts for the Highland economy but it is very likely that the GDP performance will be even worse, with probably a fall of about 1.5 per cent. The reasons for that include the greater importance of the tourism industry. Inflation in 2023 is forecast to be about five per cent. That implies an annual fall in personal incomes of about 6.5 per cent in the Highlands. That means another substantial reduction in personal spending, which will have serious negative implications for local shops and other businesses. Looking further ahead, 2024 will almost certainly be better but there can be little doubt that 2023 will be another bad year for the local economy. The world economy had a very bad 2022 because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and an inflation rate exceeding 10 per cent. The huge increase in oil and gas prices has badly affected the output of many industries and also consumer spending. There is little expectation of an improvement until later in 2023, as the above forecasts show. The Highlands have a diversified economy, dominated by the service sector, including tourism in normal years. The manufacturing sector is relatively small but includes important industries such as offshore oil and gas production, renewable energy, Scotch whisky and fish processing. Public sector employment has held up well, because of the importance of bodies such as the Highland Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, NatureScot and the Crofting Commission. However, all their budgets have been under severe pressure and that will continue during 2023. Tourism is very important for many parts of the Highlands. It had a very bad 2022 and unfortunately there are few signs of a significant improvement in 2023. There were big falls in visitor numbers last year because of the various Covid restrictions, which resulted in similar falls in revenue for local hotels, B&Bs and many local shops. Hopefully there will be a revival during 2023. Some industries have done surprisingly well, such as Scotch whisky. New distilleries and expansions are currently under construction in various parts of the Highlands. It is a very strange time for the energy industry in the Highlands, including offshore oil and gas, wind farms and other renewables. Oil and gas production is declining steadily but the recent huge increases in world oil and gas prices have helped existing fields and will possibly lead to a few new developments, despite environmental opposition. In contrast, there has been disappointing progress with renewable energy developments and there are few reasons to expect 2023 to be better. A few local businesses, notably Global Energy at Nigg, are doing very well from wind farm contracts but the overall growth has been much less than predicted. The fishing industry should have a better year because of recent international agreements on fish catches. It and the local fish farms have also benefitted from the rises in consumer prices. Most other local businesses have been badly affected by the huge rises in energy prices. However, world oil and gas prices have fallen significantly in recent weeks. Consumer confidence is low and I expect that to continue during the first half of 2023 at least. The lower consumer spending will have negative impacts for shops and other service sector businesses. More closures seem inevitable. There can be little doubt that the first half of 2023 will be another bad time for the Highland economy. I hope there will be a big improvement during the second half of the year but the current indications are not promising. Tony Mackay is an Inverness-based economist.

Morris Leslie, the company behind the West Kinfauns plans, won planning permission in principle in August. 2022? The proposal is for a four-star, four-storey hotel as well as holiday lodges, transport museum and shops. Cafes, restaurants, bakeries and a cycle repair shops could also form part of the development, which could create up to 130 full-time jobs. Next steps in Perthshire leisure hub Morris Leslie’s group operations director Graham Ogilvie has revealed the next steps for the development. Reflecting on a year of progress, he said: “2022 has all been about getting the consent. 2023 is working through the consent and splitting the development into different parts. “The lodges will be the first part of the development. We will progress with the applying for detailed consent and then construction will commence. “This is something we will do ourselves. In the past 18 months we have created our first holiday park at Alyth. This would also be done under the Morris Leslie Villages banner. “It will be around 50 lodges on site. This part of the project alone would be an investment of around £10 million.” Hotel operator sought Morris Leslie is best known for hiring construction equipment, but also has auction and property interests. It also has its headquarters on the site it acquired from Edrington in 2019. However, the company is not going to be a hotel operator. Armed with the outline planning permission from Perth and Kinross Council it will be marketing the hotel opportunity. “There have been discussions with operators that are ongoing,” Mr Ogilvie said. “Getting the brand is the easier bit, it’s the funding and development of the construction project where there are negotiations and discussions ongoing. “I’d like to think we’ll have an operator on board in 12 months’ time.” He warns that the quoted £33.8 million cost is likely to be far higher due to inflation. “The build costs from when we started the project to where we are now have moved significantly but room rates for hotels have moved higher as well,” he said. The park and ride facility, museum and retail elements of the project are likely to come at the later stages of the development. Neighbouring the site is a new 15-home development by Ogilvie Homes who won permission on appeal to the Scottish Government. Morris Leslie hopes around 80,000 people a year could be attracted to the site, boosting the local economy by £4m.

Comment No one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are The dysfunctional rail system can only be fixed if rail pensions are also sorted out John Ralfe 6 January 2023 • 9:35am 350,000 people are part of the Railways Pension Scheme Credit: Jacob King/PA Wire New Year, new rail strikes, new chaos for rail passengers. Although unions have been locked in a bitter dispute with government and rail companies for months, over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions, we haven’t heard much about pensions. Perhaps this is because no one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are? Pensions for train operating company staff are still based on final salary, and most still have a retirement age of 60. Even public sector pensions are now based on career average salaries, with a higher retirement age. The average salary for a train driver with 10-20 years experience is reported to be £55,000, so a driver retiring at 60 with 30 years pension would get an average inflation-linked pension of £22,000, plus a £33,000 cash lump sum. Train company accounts show the annual cost of new pension promises is around 60pc of salary – a huge part of overall pay – even after employee contributions. Rail pensions have a unique “cost sharing” arrangement, with all regular and deficit cash contributions split 60/40 between employers and employees, which may explain the reluctance to increase annual cash contributions. Each train operating company is part of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), set up at privatisation in 1994. It is an industry-wide scheme with over 100 legally separate sections, including Network Rail, and freight, engineering and maintenance companies. At privatisation, all pensioners and deferred members were transferred to a new section with a “crown guarantee” underwritten by taxpayers. RPS is one of the UK’s largest pension schemes, with £37bn of assets at December 2021, and 350,000 members, including 100,000 current employees. Each RPS section has a three-year valuation but the December 2016 valuation for train operating companies have still not been agreed with the Pensions Regulator, way, way beyond the legal deadline. Although the established rail franchising rules mean train operating companies must pay cash contributions over the life of a franchise, they have no liability for a deficit when the franchise ends. The deficit is simply passed on to the next company taking over the franchise, in a game of pass-the-parcel. If no one is prepared to take on the franchise, it reverts to the Government. The latest accounts for each of the train operating companies show the combined pension deficit is around £8bn. We know the effective re-nationalisation of the train operators in 2020 means all the industry’s annual losses are paid by taxpayers. But re-nationalisation also means taxpayers are on the hook for the pension deficit, which has been hidden from taxpayers. The dysfunctional rail system can only be sorted out if rail pensions are also sorted out. Despite the threat of further strikes, this means closing the expensive and risky defined benefit pension and moving to defined contribution. The good news for rail staff is that some of the cost savings can be used to increase monthly pay. Defined contributions would still leave the £8bn deficit to be paid, partly through higher fares, but with taxpayers left picking up most of the bill.

The British Medical Association (BMA) warned of three days of further disruption for the NHS if health secretary Steve Barclay continues to refuse to negotiate over pay demands. It comes ahead of a ballot opening on 9 January, when 45,000 junior doctors in England will be asked whether they want to strike in the row over pay. The BMA claimed that Mr Barclay was making attempts to find a negotiated settlement impossible by ignoring “all calls and letters” despite the prospect of strike action. “Pay erosion, exhaustion and despair are forcing junior doctors out of the NHS, pushing waiting lists even higher as patients suffer needlessly,” said Dr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Robert Laurenson, co-chairs of the BMA junior doctors committee. They added: “The government’s refusal to address fifteen years of pay erosion has given junior doctors no choice but to ballot for industrial action. If the government won’t fight for our health service, then we will.” The union said successive governments have overseen 15 years of real-term pay cuts for junior doctors, saying it amounted to a “staggering and unjustifiable” 26.1 per cent decline in pay since 2008-09. But the government has awarded only a 2 per cent pay rise for junior doctors, and Mr Barclay has continued to point to the recommendation of the independent pay review body as a reason to avoid negotiations. The BMA said it was “particularly galling” to see Rishi Sunak and his ministers refer to the pay review body. “The reality is that the doctors’ pay review body has been constrained by political interference for more than a decade,” said the union’s co-chairs. The prospect of fresh NHS disruption comes as ambulance staff prepare to walk out on 11 and 23 January, while nurses will strike again for two consecutive days on 18 and 19 January. The government has vowed to press ahead with plans to introduce new legislation to enforce “minimum safety levels” in the NHS and five other key sectors during industrial action. Health unions reacted with fury to the move, saying it would do nothing to resolve the disputes breaking out across the country. The Royal College of Nursing, GMB and Unison – leading the walks-outs planned for nurses and ambulance staff later in January – also vowed to opposed “desperate” anti-strike legislation. The government also urged union leaders to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about public sector pay settlements for 2023-24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged strikes. But unions bosses said ministers must engage on pay demands for the current year, with the GMB health union accusing the government of trying to “kick the can down the road”. The BMA and other health bodies have warned of an “exodus” of NHS staff as industrial dispute rumbles on. Four in ten (40 per cent) of junior doctors plan to leave the health service as soon as they can find another role, a survey carried out by the BMA last month found. Low pay and poor working conditions were the main reasons cited for wanting to leave, with the union warning that the NHS “would not be able to cope” without two-fifths of its junior doctor workforce. It comes after Mr Barclay appeared to blame high numbers of flu, Covid and Strep A cases for the particular pressures the NHS faced over Christmas – a claim refuted by health leaders who pointed to long-term struggles. Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA’s consultants committee, said the government’s refusal to admit that the NHS is in a state crisis was “simply delusional”.",Junior doctors to vote on plans to hold three-day strike in row over pay,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/junior-doctors-strike-nhs-march-b2256855.html

The latest S&P Global/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI), closely watched by the housebuilding sector, scored 48.8 in December, down from 50.4 in November. Any score below 50 indicates that construction sector output has shrunk, and December’s score marks the first contraction since August. It also came in broadly in line with the consensus, with analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics predicting PMI would fall to around 48.5. The sector has suffered the knock-on effects of a slowing housing market, with mortgages becoming more expensive for home buyers resulting in fewer house sales, economists said. Yet construction firms continue to face higher inflation, pushing up the cost of raw materials and transportation, and the looming threat of a recession. As a result, builders are feeling downbeat about the future of their businesses, the survey revealed. December saw confidence among businesses in the outlook for the year drop into negative territory for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and for only the sixth time on record. Dr John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: “The construction sector was stuck in the mud in December with the steepest fall in activity since the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020 and a similarly fast drop in pipelines of new work. “Housebuilding saw a notable change of direction, with a mix of higher inflation for raw materials and transportation and the squeeze on affordability rates for mortgages resulting in fewer house sales.” The commercial sector marked a “bright spot” in the survey, with activity growing fractionally, with a score of 50.3. But it was offset by contractions across the residential and civil engineering sectors in December. Dr Glen added: “Civil engineering, responsible for larger projects, continued to be the weakest performer again, with a sixth month in the doldrums as uncertainty about the UK economy reared its ugly head again and customers hesitated.” Furthermore, the survey suggests that builders are reining back on recruitment amid a hesitancy to spend too much when the future of the economy is uncertain. Employment fell below a score of 50 for the first time since January 2021, with weak sales meaning that vacancies are often not being filled, the survey indicated. Dr Glen said: “Builders are fast running out of the resilient spirit maintained over the last couple of years as the blocks to success piled up and the winter of discontent with high inflation, strikes and shortages continues.” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The construction sector managed to keep its head above water through the autumn, but now is being dragged down by the recession in the wider economy and the surge in borrowing costs faced by households and businesses.” But he pointed out that a drop in activity in December may have been partially driven by some builders “downing tools” during the week of heavy snow across parts of the UK.",Builders deflated as construction sector shrinks,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/builders-deflated-as-construction-sector-shrinks-b2257249.html

Speaking on a visit to a school in Battersea, south-west London, the Prime Minister said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday.” Pressed whether the talks would include discussions on this year’s pay, the Prime Minister did not rule this out, saying: “What we have said is we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation with all union leaders about what is responsible, what is reasonable, and what is affordable for our country when it comes to pay. “I’m hopeful that those talks can be constructive and we can find a way through this.” Asked whether he could meet the nursing union’s demands “halfway” after it suggested a pay rise of ten per cent rather than nearly double, the PM added: “We have always been clear that we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation, a two way conversation with union leaders.” The Standard understands that the move is a new approach by the Government, with Cabinet ministers, not the PM, meeting the unions that their departments work with, and that the Government aims to talk about pay deals for 2023/24 rather than this year. However, the stand-off between the Government and unions has escalated after ministers proposed bringing in legislation to force some sectors such as health and transport to continue delivering a “minimum service” during industrial action. Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation. Asked a second time whether people could be sacked for not going to work under the new law, the premier said: ""I fully believe in the unions' role in our society and the freedom for them to strike. ""I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption. ""That's why we're going to bring forward new laws, in common with countries like France, Italy, Spain and others, that ensure that we have minimum levels of safety in critical areas like fire, like ambulance, so that even when strikes are going on you know that your health will be protected. ""I think that's entirely reasonable and that's what our new laws will do."" Labour has said it would repeal the “minimum service” laws, if they are passed before the General Election, and if it wins the poll expected next year. Britain is being hit by a wave of strikes including by rail workers, nurses, paramedics, postal workers, border staff and civil servants.","Rishi Sunak invites all union leaders for ‘grown-up, honest’ talks on Monday in bid to end strikes",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/strikes-rishi-sunak-unions-talks-rail-nurses-b1051247.html

The Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure vital public services maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike. Minimum safety levels will be set for fire, ambulance and rail services and the Government said it will consult on the “adequate level of coverage”. Speaking from the picket line at Euston station on Friday, Mr Lynch told BBC Breakfast that the Government is trying to “close down” the unions with the new legislation. “What this is a symbol of is that the Government are losing the argument,” he said. “They’ve lost the argument on austerity and pay, and the state of our national public services. “And instead they want to close that argument down by closing down the unions and stopping us from campaigning against poverty.” He said the Bill is a threat to sack union members if they refuse to go to work. “What they are saying is that they will sack our members if they don’t go to work,” he said. “They are going to conscript our members. “We have to name who will go to work, and if those members in a lawful manner don’t want to cross our picket line they can be dismissed individually and the union can be fined. “So we will have to see what the law says.” It comes as services have been crippled by the walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) at Network Rail and 14 train operators on Friday. The action will last for 48 hours and follows a stoppage on Thursday by train drivers in the Aslef union which caused widespread disruption. Only around 20% of normal services are running on Friday and trains will finish earlier. The strike ends a week of industrial action on the railways, with the dispute remaining deadlocked. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a school in south-west London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had invited union leaders for what he hopes will be a “grown-up” conversation on Monday about what is affordable. The Prime Minister was asked if proposed legislation could see nurses sacked for striking, and if it was his ambition to go further and make some more strikes in critical services illegal. Mr Sunak said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday. “We incredibly value the important work that our public sector workers do, especially our nurses, and we want to have an honest, grown-up conversation about what’s affordable, what’s responsible for the country. “Those invitations have gone out and I’m hopeful that those meetings can happen on Monday so we can have a productive conversation and find a way through this.” Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation.

As many projects were pushed back last year, the beginning of 2023 will be marked by a steady pipeline of work. However, this optimism will be short-lived. Recessionary forces will strike and work is expected to tail off at the back end of 2023. No one feels confident. It is a nervous period to operate as a business, and the sector must stay alert. For the housing market, demand is falling amidst the cost of living crisis, job insecurity and the recession. Declining property prices should stabilise by Spring 2023 yet only those not bound to the difficulties of securing a mortgage or with sufficient savings will be able to afford the luxury of entering the property ladder. The government could help stimulate demand in the housing market by introducing a reduced stamp duty rate for first-time buyers and those wanting to downsize to a smaller property. Confidence in the market will return, but it will take time. Ultimately while the best-run construction companies will survive, partly due to their inherent financial strength, others, including good contractors who may be dependent on third parties, will unfortunately fail. The recession and cost of the living crisis will continue to bite hard. The sector must brace itself for a challenging and uncertain 2023.","UK building sector activity falls, as house prices drop again; eurozone inflation down – business live",https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jan/06/uk-house-prices-fall-us-jobs-eurozone-inflation-train-strikes-business-live

New arrivals include kitchen company Counter Interiors, Florians Bakery, fire and security specialists Derventio, Ryedale Garage Doors, Pelican Bus and Truck Parts and Rare Bird Gin, while existing occupiers Bella di Notte and The Chef’s Choice have moved into new business units on the park. We're holding the first BUSINESSiQ Awards - to nominate someone, CLICK HERE In addition, a number of other bespoke units on the 180,000 sq ft site, ranging from 2,000 sq ft upwards, have been sold to private investors. In all, occupiers from a wide range of business sectors have taken a combined total of 120,000 sq ft at Malton’s premier employment park. Sean Harrison, managing director of Harrison Developments said: “These new deals are a tremendous vindication of the substantial investment we have made in our park. “More than 350 new and sustainable jobs have been created on site, which makes us very proud. The wide variety of successful businesses here is also an indication of the strength of the economy in the Ryedale area. Bella di Notte (Image: Press release) “We are especially pleased that successful Yorkshire businesses such as Bella di Notte and Dales The Chef’s Choice have moved into larger premises on our park, because they like the location and the ambience so much. We have been delighted to accommodate their needs, as they have outgrown their current buildings. “These are not the easiest of times, as we emerge from a global pandemic into a worrying cost of living crisis, but the current level of activity at our park gives us confidence for the future,” said Mr Harrison. Luke Counter, owner of the multi-award-winning Counter Interiors, which now occupies a new 1,500 sq ft mezzanine showroom, said: “I can’t speak highly enough of the Malton Enterprise Park, which is the perfect base for us. The flexibility of the mezzanine unit which we occupy means that we now have an extensive showroom, storeroom and offices. “We are based in Clifton in York, but quite a few of our customers are from the Malton and Ryedale area, so it made sense for us to open another showroom here. The location, just by the A64, is ideal, with easy access to the rest of the county. The whole park looks magnificent, which creates the perfect atmosphere for businesses here to flourish.” Meanwhile Bella di Notte, the popular women’s fashion retailer, which originally moved to the Malton Enterprise Park four years ago, has recently taken extra space to accommodate its growth.

We will build speculatively and will either sell or lease the new units. “These units will be single or two-storey commercial buildings which will be designed with maximum flexibility to allow a range of uses, including light industrial, offices, general industrial and retail, trade and warehousing. Sizes range from 1,000 sq ft to 50,000 sq ft.” Other major occupiers on site include Screwfix, JMP Packaging, Direct Imaging, Toolstation, the Pebblechild charity, Aquapoint, Be Amazing Arts, Puddleducks Children’s Nursery, Rhodium Car Valeting and No Limits Cycling.",Malton Enterprise Park in North Yorkshire celebrates new deals,https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/23232614.malton-enterprise-park-north-yorkshire-celebrates-new-deals/?ref=rss

Just this week, Amazon said it was axing 18,000 workers, or 6% of its office staff, while business software firm Salesforce said it would reduce its workforce by 10%, or roughly 8,000 people. That followed announcements from dozens of other firms including big names such as Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, hardware heavyweight Cisco, and payments firm Stripe. Despite the belt-tightening seen in Silicon Valley, the world's largest economy soldiers on. Employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, according to the latest official figures. Although that was slower than gains seen in 2021, when activity roared back to life after the pandemic, it was still strong by most standards. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, returning to historic lows. The economy is widely predicted to slow in the coming months as rising prices weigh on consumer spending. Firms are also grappling with higher borrowing costs after the US central bank hiked rates rapidly last year. So are the cuts in the tech industry a warning sign for others? ""I don't think people should be worried,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. ""What we're seeing right now seems to be... a correction, not the start of an ominous, systematic recession."" Many tech executives making the announcements have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic, when more activity moved online and business boomed. Funding for smaller start-ups has also dried up due to higher interest rates and the sharp downturn in the US stock market in 2022. Big hits some firms have taken from the meltdown in the crypto sector have not helped the mood either. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM, said the wave of tech cuts represented a ""necessary and expected"" adjustment after a generation of rapid growth, fuelled in part by low interest rates, which culminated in the pandemic frenzy. ""An era of excess has come to an end,"" he said. ""Firms and individuals should be prepared to reset expectations about growth, employment and investment across what continues to be a very solid industry."" He suggested that tech firms will no longer be insulated from ups and downs in the wider economy, including the expected downturns in Europe and the UK this year. But he added that the job losses should not be ""over-interpreted"", noting that many of the workers affected, at least in the US, appear to be finding new jobs quickly. The latest jobs report from the Labor Department showed that payrolls in the information sector - which includes much of the tech industry - shrank by just 5,000 from November to December. That's despite thousands of job cuts being announced in recent months and compared to a year ago, employment is up. ""It's probably a canary in the coal mine for the global economy more than it is for the American economy,"" he added, noting that many of the tech cuts have hit foreign staff. Last week, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that a third of the world would likely be in recession in 2023. That will hurt tech firms, many of which do big business overseas. But for now, the US labour market has remained unexpectedly resilient, making some hopeful that the country will be able to fend off a harsh downturn, despite the central bank raising interest rates to try to cool the economy and price rises. Nearly every sector in the US economy added jobs last month, with bars and restaurants, health care firms and construction businesses helping to drive the gains. Although job losses are rising - especially in sectors vulnerable to higher interest rates like housing, banking and tech - the figures overall remained near historic lows last year, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has been tracking such announcements since the 1990s. ""We are seeing the labour market cooling,"" he says. ""It's a slowdown but I don't think I could say at this point whether or not it's a panic situation."" Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, said he worries many of the layoff announcements reflect peer pressure, as executives feel compelled to copy other firms making cuts - even as they continue to churn out healthy profits. If that sentiment spreads, as he expects, it risks turning the forecasts of economic hardship into reality. ""Companies do what other companies do,"" he said. ""This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because if everybody lays somebody off, the unemployment rate will go up and we will in fact have a worse economy.""",Are tech job cuts a warning for the wider economy?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64189106?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Rebecca Morelle,85546280,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F74F/production/_128211336_virgin-orbit-88.jpg,en,2023-01-07 04:12:22,-0.019,GB,"The first-ever orbital rocket launch from British soil is set to blast off on Monday, marking the start of the UK's race to space. The ambition is to turn the country into a global player in space - from manufacturing satellites, to building rockets and creating new spaceports. But can the UK carve out a place in an increasingly crowded market - and why try to reach for the stars? ""We are the guinea pigs,"" says Melissa Thorpe. ""It is the first time any of us have done this, so it's been quite a learning experience."" Melissa is in charge of Spaceport Cornwall, which is about to attempt its very first foray into space. She's showing me around their base at Newquay Airport. There's all the usual hubbub of activity: passengers arriving, suitcases being loaded, planes being fuelled. But there's also something more surprising on the tarmac: a 21m-long rocket. A team is busy prepping it for the first ever launch from UK soil that will take satellites into orbit around the Earth. But this is a blast off with a difference. There won't be a vertical launch from the ground. Instead, the rocket is fixed underneath the wing of a modified jumbo jet. Once the plane is mid-air, the rocket will be released and fire its engines to head into space. Setting up the UK's first spaceport has taken years and a lot of hard work, plus an entirely new regulatory framework to ensure these launches are safe. The hope is it will make a difference to the local area, one of the poorest in the UK, by bringing in new companies and creating new jobs. ""I think it's the next chapter for Cornwall,"" Melissa says. ""We were at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. We're not new to pioneering technologies."" But there's a wider ambition too. If this succeeds, it should help to position the UK as a leading place for space. However, this isn't the first attempt at creating a British launch industry. A white and red rocket, nicknamed ""the lipstick"", was supposed to be the start of something big for the UK. It blasted off in 1971, sending a satellite into space. The programme was called Black Arrow, and this was the first British-built rocket to deliver a British-built satellite into orbit - although it took off from Australia. But the costs were deemed too high by the government, so that first launch turned out to be the last. The UK's launch industry hit a long pause after this, but another aspect did take off in Britain - satellite building. And this has helped to drive a thriving space sector, which, according to a recent government report, is worth £16.5bn a year to the UK economy and employs nearly 50,000 people. ""We absolutely knock it out of the park when it comes to small satellite manufacture,"" says Dr Alice Bunn, CEO of UKSpace, the trade association of British space companies. Until now, she says, satellites built in the UK have had to be shipped abroad to get into space, but this first launch will change that. And it comes at a time when satellites have become integral to our lives - although Alice says most people are unaware of how dependent we are on this technology. ""Think about satellite navigation systems, environmental monitoring, emergency response - let alone all the telecommunications capability - that we can provide from space. It really is a running thread through our lives,"" she says. And some companies have big plans with this technology. The Cardiff-based company Space Forge thinks a whole host of new materials can be made in orbit. In a cleanroom, one of their small satellites is being painstakingly prepared for its journey. It's one of nine being sent into space by the Cornwall launch. Space Forge describe their shoe box-sized satellites as mini factories. ""In space, with the absence of gravity, you can mix together any different materials you want,"" says Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bacon. ""So if you take the whole periodic table, and start putting things together - like lead, aluminium, rubidium, einsteinium - there are billions of new alloys that you can now make that you couldn't make on Earth."" The new materials could be used in electric vehicles, green technology or computing, he explains. And he thinks there are some big advantages to launching these satellites close to their Welsh base. ''The fact that we can just drive down the road for a couple hours to get to our spaceport is a huge impact,"" Andrew says. But it's not just Cornwall racing to space. Amidst the bleakly beautiful undulating hills and jagged cliffs of the Shetland island of Unst, there's a hive of activity as diggers and dumper trucks come and go. The team here is celebrating because an important milestone has been reached. The concrete is setting on their first launch pad, one of three planned at the site. The SaxaVord Spaceport is being constructed on a peninsula jutting out into the sea, at the northernmost tip of the UK. ""I think the first response from the locals was that maybe it was an April Fool or something like that,"" says Debbie Strang, SaxaVord's chief operating officer. ""And then, as they've seen the progress and the development, there's been real excitement about what we've been doing."" There's a good reason why they've chosen such a remote place, where sheep and Shetland ponies outnumber the inhabitants. ""It's the safety element for us,"" says Debbie. ""What we're doing needs to be as far away as possible from population centres, so that when the rocket leaves, there's no real danger to people nearby."" SaxaVord is aiming for the UK's first vertical rocket launch to take satellites into orbit, with up to 30 launches a year once it's fully up and running. It's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland. Others are planned in Sutherland in the Highlands and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. The hope is that these could all boost local economies, and that's especially important in Unst. ""This island's suffered quite badly from depopulation over the last 20 or 30 years,"" explains Scott Hammond, the deputy CEO of SaxaVord. ""There was a small airfield here that used to be the third busiest heliport in the UK. And then they also had an RAF station here. ""When that left, it halved the population of the island and it clearly had a massive economic impact."" He hopes the spaceport could give the island a boost. ""We'll have more and more service jobs, during the fuelling of the rockets, for example, putting the liquid oxygen into the rockets. And those of course, will be highly paid, highly skilled jobs."" But if you're building a launchpad, you also need rockets - and SaxaVord is working with several companies looking to use Unst to blast off. One of these is Skyrora, based in Cumbernauld, just outside of Glasgow. Inside their vast hanger, the team is busy working on different rocket parts, from nose cones, to engines and containers for propellants. The company is making smaller prototypes, before building a larger rocket, Skyrora XL, that they plan to eventually launch from the Shetland Islands. ""You do a full design on paper and then you start building it. You build prototypes, you do tests, you go back to the drawing board and see what needs to be fixed,"" says Ahsan Zaman. He's just finished his aerospace degree, and says the new push for space in the UK is opening up opportunities for science and engineering graduates. He's proud to be working on the project. ""If we're successful, then we'll forever be known as the first people to do it in the UK. So yeah, it is an honour as well as exciting."" While the launch industry is just starting to come together in the UK, it's much better established in other parts of the world. And one company in particular now dominates the market: Elon Musk's SpaceX. With their reusable rockets, the company has massively cut the price of sending satellites into space. Can the raft of small new rocket companies compete? Skyrora's CEO Volodymyr Levykin says he wants his rockets to offer a more bespoke service. ""We want to be like a satellite taxi service,"" he explains. ""To launch whenever the customer wants us to launch and deliver them to an exact position they need to be in orbit."" He thinks because more and more small satellites are being built, the market to launch them will grow - but not every company will make it. ""Some of us, of course, will fail,"" he says. ""But there are some who are believers in this emerging market. And we decided to invest earlier rather than later, to be ready when the market actually will start to boom."" The UK government says it wants to push the space sector, and is investing in research and development. But UKSpace's Alice Bunn says the support needs to be long term. ""You will not become a global space player by investing in research and development alone. There has to be some kind of government commitment to ongoing operational capability."" She says this could mean the government signing up as a customer for launches, for example. ""We need to think a little bit creatively, industry and government working together, just to get us off the ground here."" All eyes are now on Cornwall, waiting for the first UK launch to blast off. It will be just the start for this new industry and there will be many challenges ahead. But as the well-known mantra goes, space is hard - and anyone working in this sector knows this. The hope is that with this high risk, comes the possibility of sky-high rewards. Follow Rebecca on Twitter.

In a sign of the scale of the problems facing the NHS, Rishi Sunak will spend Saturday focusing on how to ease the pressure on frontline services. But Mr Sunak has been warned that the rare weekend meeting is unlikely to reverse the NHS’ fortunes, which have been blamed on “years of inaction”. Senior doctors say the NHS is on a knife edge, with many A&E units struggling to keep up with demand and trusts and ambulance services declaring critical incidents. Discharge rates fell to a new low in England last week, with only a third of those patients ready to be released from hospital actually leaving. Mr Sunak, during a visit to a school on Friday, said he recognised that the NHS was “under enormous pressure”. No 10’s NHS Recovery Forum will see the Prime Minister hold talks with health experts about how to improve performance. Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Treasury minister John Glen, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden and the chief executive officer of NHS England Amanda Pritchard are also set to attend. The focus will be on four crucial issues: social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care, and primary care. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there were “no silver bullets” to solving the crisis currently being experienced at hospitals and other care centres. “This crisis has been a decade or more in the making and we are now paying the high price for years of inaction and managed decline,” said Mr Taylor. “Patients are experiencing delays that we haven’t seen for years. “High levels of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rising Covid levels are exacerbating the problem but the cause is decades of under-investment in staffing, capital and the lack of a long-term solution to the capacity-crunch facing social care. “None of these problems can be solved tomorrow.” The Prime Minister, in his first speech of 2023 on Wednesday, made reducing NHS waiting lists one of his key pledges before the next election, which is due to take place before 2025. Saturday’s Downing Street forum is expected to last most of the day. As well as ministers, attendees will include chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations, local areas and councils from across the country. Clinical experts from Royal Colleges and independent sector organisations working with health and social care services to deliver services for patients are also expected to join the Prime Minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “As the Prime Minister made clear this week, easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS is one of his key promises. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting branded the meeting a “talking shop”. The senior Labour figure said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor, a former Labour and Tony Blair aide, agreed with the criticism, saying the investment to improve discharge rates came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. He added: “Indeed, some local systems are still awaiting their allocation. “Any similar funding next year must be provided four to six months in advance so it can genuinely ease winter pressures.” On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet with union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year. However, Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen has told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” over the current settlement to prevent planned strikes. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll, of course, go to the meeting and make the case for nursing in all forums, but it’s sadly not what’s going to prevent strike action that’s planned for 10 days’ time. “I have put out an olive branch to get us to the table, I’m asking the Prime Minister now to meet the RCN halfway. The ball is firmly in the Prime Minister’s court.” A Department of Health and Social Care source said the Health Secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”.",Sunak to hold emergency No 10 talks in bid to ease winter care crisis,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/steve-barclay-matthew-taylor-nhs-wes-streeting-prime-minister-b2257731.html

The prime minister told health and social care leaders during an emergency summit in Downing Street on Saturday that it was a “collective responsibility” to free up hospital beds and slash ambulance waiting times. But Ms Cullen said his pledge will fail unless he gives her members a pay rise. She warned Mr Sunak the public would back nurses over the government if any were sacked as part of a new anti-strike crackdown and claimed the upcoming nurses’ walkout will be the biggest strike of its kind in the world. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Cullen also challenged the “out of touch” prime minister and health secretary Steve Barclay to work a 14-hour shift in a crisis-hit emergency ward. She said Mr Sunak could end the strikes this week if he takes up her offer to meet in the middle on pay, after saying she was willing to discuss a raise of 10 per cent instead of the 19 per cent originally asked for. During the crunch summit to solve the chaos engulfing English hospitals, Mr Sunak warned health leaders “business-as-usual mindset won’t fix the challenges we face”. England’s chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty and NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard were among those summoned for the rare weekend meeting. The prime minister is understood to be looking at ideas including the use of technology to help people stay out of hospital and increasing the number of “virtual wards”. He also highlighted that a small number of NHS trusts were responsible for a large proportion of serious issues, including long ambulance waits and waiting times for cancer care. Downing Street has said it will publish recovery plans to improve ambulance and A&E waiting times “in the coming weeks”. As Mr Sunak battles to bring the current crisis under control, Ms Cullen urged him to understand the scale of the upcoming nurses’ strike. A 48-hour walkout in England from 18 January will involve more hospitals than similar strikes last month’s action. She said: “We balloted around 320,000 nursing staff and my understanding is it has been the largest ballot of nursing staff in the world and it is the largest nursing strike in the world. We’ve also increased the number of organisations [such as NHS Trusts]. There are now 70 involved. First time around it was 46.” She also revealed that she had received messages of support from senior politicians in several European countries. December’s strikes were headline news in France, Italy, Spain and Austria among others. The world was “watching in dismay”, Ms Cullen said. She urged Mr Sunak to learn from the experience of other international leaders who were forced to back down in the face of ward walkouts, including Irish prime ministers in the first decade of this century. “What this government should look to is how the leader of [Ireland] stepped in very quickly and did not allow both of those strikes to go beyond the first few days,” she said. “And took immediate action. And that was because the public pressure was enormous.” On Wednesday, Mr Sunak set out his vision for the NHS, including a personal pledge to cut waiting lists. But he was criticised for offering nothing to end the current crisis or the strikes, which will also see ambulance staff take action later this month. “He made a broad, bold statement that he was going to cut waiting lists, but he won’t unless he addresses the crisis in nursing ... and the only way you are going to do that is to address the fundamental issue of nurses’ pay,” Ms Cullen said. Strike action will have to escalate if the government continues to ignore nurses, she said, although no decisions have yet been taken on what that would look like. Ms Cullen added: “He could bring it to a resolution this coming week – and avert industrial action. I will make myself available any night or any day. Let’s get round a table. Let’s have a discussion. “I think they owe that to the profession, to all those 320,000 nurses. And they owe it to every patient in this country, particularly those 7.2 million sitting on waiting lists year on year, to get around a table.” On Friday Mr Sunak refused to rule out that nurses could be sacked as part of his new crackdown, swerving the question in a broadcast interview. She described “any suggestion that they would sack any nurse… simply because nurses are standing up for their patients and the NHS” as “disheartening” given that there were currently 47,000 vacancies in the UK. Describing the prime minister as “out of touch” with the realities of the current crisis, she challenged Mr Sunak and his health secretary to work a 14-hour shift in an emergency department. She said: “From 7am to late into the evening, when a number of those hours will be unpaid, when the nurses should be off shift and home but they have no one to hand their patients on to. “They need to just walk in the shoes of those nurses for a few of those shifts. And I think that would make better decisions.” Leaving the NHS Recovery Forum on Saturday, consultant physician James Dunbar told reporters he was “confident that action will be taken” to address the crisis – but not optimistic it would be dealt with before spring. “These are difficult problems to fix though, so I think it’s unlikely we’ll have it sorted by the end of this winter,” he said. Dr Dunbar said that “a lot of” senior clinical leaders taking part were “saying the same thing”, adding: “The prime minister seemed to understand that.” Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Adrian Boyle meanwhile said the crisis is “fixable” and welcomed emergency care being “recognised as a priority”. A Downing Street spokesperson said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she added. A Department of Health and Social Care source said the health secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”. A government spokesperson said: “The health and social care secretary wants to have an honest conversation with unions, including the RCN, about what is affordable in pay settlements for next year during these challenging times, and is keen to meet for discussions as soon as possible. “We have accepted the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in full and have given over 1 million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. This is on top of a 3 per cent pay increase last year when public sector pay was frozen and wider government support with the cost of living.”",Rishi Sunak warned waiting list pledge will fail without NHS pay rise as he calls for ‘radical’ action,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/pat-cullen-nurses-rcn-strikes-b2257639.html

Unlike other foodbanks, St Gregory’s does not require users to provide a referral from an agency. It distributes free bags comprising up to 20 items including cereal, pasta, canned soup, tuna, tinned fruit, long-life milk and eggs. Toiletries, washing powder and washing-up liquid are also available. Co-ordinator Eileen Low said the number of people seeking help had soared by more than 30% since the pandemic’s peak while in the week before Christmas volunteers distributed a record number of bags. “We have just had our biggest ever week with 219 basic bags being handed out to help more than 500 individuals and families,” she said. “It is a grim new record to end the year with for us.” Low said that the foodbank’s clientele had also changed since the cost of living crisis started to bite this winter and many more working families were now seeking help. “When we started out five years ago, we were distributing between 30 and 40 bags weekly and it was usually to the most vulnerable people such as refugees, single pensioners and those with mental health or addiction issues,” she explained. “But now we are seeing more and more parents who have low-paid jobs such as cleaners and hospitality workers coming to us for help because they can’t pay the bills and feed their kids at the same time. “The working poor is a growing sector in our area and the government seems unable to do something constructive about it, so that’s where community-based charities come in. We are another safety net for people who are struggling financially and the authorities seem happy to let the likes of us pick up the slack. “It is obscene that this is happening in this day in age. At times we feel as though we are providing a new frontline service.” Ingrid Mitchell, who lives locally, has been volunteering at St Gregory’s for the past three years. She helps to shop for staples and hands out and delivers bags to foodbank users. The mother of two is a senior cabin crew member with a large airline, serving meals and drinks to passengers on transatlantic routes. She has been shocked by the surge in families seeking assistance from the foodbank. She said: “Many people feel embarrassed to ask for help but some have no other choice and they now rely on us. I have always been community minded and it is awful to see ordinary people in this situation. Sadly, I can’t see this crisis easing any time soon.” ‘We are warm and can offer a respite to what is going on’ No longer just a place to borrow books or study for exams, libraries are introducing a range of activities, clubs and groups to create “warm and welcoming spaces” that people can utilise during the cost of living crisis, writes Alice Hinds. From movie matinees and craft groups to mindful colouring-in sessions for adults and regular coffee mornings, library leaders say such innovative services provide a vital lifeline for people in the community who would otherwise struggle to find warm, comfortable and, importantly, free places to spend time during winter months. Ray Pattie, library adviser at Edinburgh Central Library, says the centres have always provided support for communities but new groups have become increasingly popular for people who may feel isolated or worried about spending money while socialising. “Our users see libraries as safe and reliable spaces,” he explained. “People just don’t have the disposable income now for sitting in Costa for hours and hours – that can turn into an expensive week, so they are looking for other things to do outside of the home. “That’s why we’re providing things like Knit And Natter, a weekly craft group, and adult colouring-in sessions, too. “The activities give people an opportunity to still come out and spend time with other people in a warm space but it’s more affordable than visiting a cafe. It’s an opportunity to meet new people as well. Since I’ve worked in libraries, it has very much been all about the community.” As well as introducing social groups, many of the Scottish capital’s libraries have also added social spaces to encourage people to visit for as long as they like. Replicating a living room with plants, comfortable seating, warm lighting and coffee tables, the areas also have free-to-use jigsaws and board games and a number of libraries have also included self-help guides on topics such as energy and money saving, and cooking on a budget. Hana Mackechnie, lifelong learning service manager for libraries in Edinburgh, said: “Some of our libraries are open 52 hours a week and you don’t need to come for a particular reason. “We’re finding that people want a space where they can spend a little bit longer, and somewhere they can also find signposting to benefits they might be entitled to, or get advice on how to access particular services. If you are a reader, you probably already feel like you’re welcome in a library but there’s so much more going on and we’re trying to introduce more activities.” Every weekday during winter, libraries across Edinburgh are also hosting movie matinees with free teas, coffees and refreshments, giving people another way to keep warm for a few hours. Acting library supervisor Natasha Gibson added: “We were already providing or about to introduce these initiatives but the situation now has brought more of a need for them and highlighted just how valuable they are for the community. “People are becoming more aware that, yes, libraries are also a place to come and be social and have a few minutes of respite from whatever is going on in life. “People do come to the library specifically to chat to people or get a change of scenery and at the moment it’s a much-needed place away from home that’s warm – both in terms of the physical surroundings and the people that are here.” ‘It is sad to see so many people struggling’ Demand for free furniture, school uniforms and even haircuts is on the rise at a community-based initiative in south-west Scotland, writes Russell Blackstock. The Furniture Project in Stranraer was originally set up to recycle, repair and provide refurbished household goods at affordable prices. But the charity, which has more than 20 volunteers and runs two shops, has also turned to providing household items and services for free to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. “We started running Freebie Friday events that are proving to be hugely popular,” said boss Paul Smith. “These include giving away items like furniture and household appliances and demand has been high. “So many low-income workers who wouldn’t normally be struggling are now coming to us because the price of everything has risen so much that they simply can’t make ends meet. “I suppose we are doing what the likes of parish organisations and local authorities might have done in the past.” Other popular services provided by the charity include organising free school uniforms and haircuts for children whose parents are struggling to get by. “A new school blazer alone can cost between £40 and £50 and if you have three kids in the house, that is a big expense for any family,” said Smith. “People can come to our shop and discreetly get a school uniform for nothing, and we run this service all through the school year. We have also started a project involving local hairdressers so that kids can get haircuts for free because, again, this can be expensive if you have a number of children in the house. “We try to help to make sure that these kids don’t feel any different from friends at school who come from better-off backgrounds. “It is sad to see so many people struggling financially at the moment but I grew up on a housing scheme that was regarded as being poor and we had to put up with hand-me-downs, so I know what that is like.” The organisation also recycles bicycles and gifts that would usually go to landfill, and sells them cheaply to people once they have been refurbished. Also, it provides a mentoring service that enables retired people to pass on skills and knowledge to youngsters so that they can find jobs in areas such as warehousing and customer services. Smith said even middle-income families were now using the project to inexpensively replace big-ticket household items such as fridges, cookers and furniture as the cost of living crisis deepens. He added: “Previously, you could almost categorise those using services like ours as being among the most vulnerable in our community but the financial pressures are now adding up for people right across the board. “We are now increasingly helping the sort of folk that we normally wouldn’t expect to see.”","Community foodbank: In this day and age, it is obscene we are so needed as a safety net for people",https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/foodbanks-warmbanks/

Being the prime minister, he must have thought, has to amount to more than acknowledging a terrifying array of looming crises. When asked what you hope to do with your time in office, you’ve got to give a more inspiring answer than “cope”, even if you’re fortunate in following a leader who didn’t even manage that. What would be a clear, constructive, positive, yet achievable, initiative? Nothing fun at this bleak time – any whiff of levity could be accused of trivialising people’s suffering. And nothing that sounds expensive. Also nothing that sounds too leftwing, what with the Tory right calling Sunak a socialist for failing to cut taxes. But nothing that sounds too rightwing either, what with the Labour party being so far ahead in the polls. Plus there are many subject areas to avoid: health, transport, defence, the economy… Probably best if it doesn’t touch on any other countries, what with Brexit being such a sore point and China getting horribler and Russia obviously. And there’s the whole illegal immigration shitstorm, so maybe steer clear of abroad altogether. Also food and fuel and housing would be good areas not to mention. Plus it shouldn’t be something that sounds difficult or people won’t believe it’s going to happen. And it shouldn’t be anything that anyone cares too much about because, its achievability notwithstanding, it still probably won’t happen. What should it be? I’d have been stumped. My best idea was: “Every hard-working family will be given a free cactus.” They could sit on kitchen tables, as symbols of bristly resilience, while people try to work out how to pay the mortgages on their freezing homes. Little green shoots of spiny recovery sprouting all over an economic wasteland. Sunak went another way. He fell back on something he could rely on, the solace of many a swot in the face of moral complexity, myself included: maths. You know where you are with maths. Maths doesn’t let you down. Maths doesn’t go on strike, or arrive uninvited on the south coast, or die because it couldn’t get an ambulance, or send bullying texts, or appear on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. Let’s do more maths! That was his new initiative. Everyone should be studying maths until the age of 18, he declared. Who can argue with that? Eight million adults in the UK are only numerate to primary school level. That’s bad. But brilliantly, all those potential voters, who presumably hate maths, won’t have to do any at all, but only agree with the principle that they should have done more previously. No one who can vote will have to do anything they don’t want to. This is an entirely inoffensive policy. The education secretary, who my investigations tell me is called Gillian Keegan, might feel aggrieved that it doesn’t leave her with much to say in her next speech. Michael Gove used to have great fun with that brief – handing out bibles and making everyone read Thomas Hardy and memorise dates – and even Gavin Williamson got to cancel everyone’s exams. The importance of maths should be something Keegan gets to bang on about to easy applause, but the PM has nicked it because every single other policy area has gone toxic. But he was determined to make it sound massive: “This is personal for me,” it was reported that he was “expected to say” in his speech. And he did! “It’s the single most important reason why I came into politics: to give every child the highest possible standard of education.” Wow – it turns out he’s a stealth educationist. He was also expected to say: “Just half of all 16-19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills is letting our children down.” Admirable sentiments, though the phrase “our children’s jobs” raises the spectre of child labour. An unfortunate slip when families are struggling to afford food and fuel and the sick are left untreated. It’s all getting a bit Dickensian. But perhaps it’s deliberate. Is this heritage austerity? Back to when Britain was great? Perhaps by “studying maths” he means “doing data entry”? Good work for children with their nimble fingers, and much safer than picking fluff out of an industrial loom, so we must count our blessings. It was a slip because, of all the things he was “expected to say”, the phrase about “children’s jobs” was the only one he didn’t. Very wise. Bless him, he just wanted to say “children” as many times as possible. A focus group must have generated that finding: saying “children” is a good look for him. Better than for Truss the malfunctioning robot or Johnson the philanderer, who just kept having children. Sunak’s children look nice – he’s shared some lovely photos – it’s a relatable family unit. Keep saying “children”, Rishi, and people will believe you care. I approve of the maths plan, but it’s such a tiny thought. In most countries that we increasingly laughably consider our equivalents, maths up to the age of 18 has long been compulsory. Rather than having an idea, he’s just picked one of myriad ways in which Britain is worse than elsewhere and resolved to correct it. It’s like saying: “We really ought to start brushing our teeth.” A small, long-overdue correction to our educational practices coming from the leader of a party that’s been in power for 12 years. It’s lame. And it won’t happen. Sunak says he “will work with the sector to move towards all children studying some form of maths to 18”. “Work with” to “move towards”. Christ. Don’t hold your breath. As Keegan’s shadow, Bridget Phillipson, put it: “He cannot deliver this reheated, empty pledge without more maths teachers, yet the government has missed their target for new maths teachers year after year.” More teachers requires more money. The money must either be raised or moved from elsewhere. That means fewer missiles or nurses or tax cuts or more taxes. Perhaps maths will let him down after all.",More maths?

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and Aslef took industrial action which crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Union leaders will meet rail minister Huw Merriman as they continue to insist the Government is blocking a deal to end the long-running row over pay, jobs and conditions. Transport Secretary Mark Harper denies the allegation, saying he is facilitating talks between unions and employers. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: “Today I want to see the Government stop play-acting because the truth, written in black and white in their rail contracts, is that they’ve been in complete control of this dispute from day one. “The train operators cannot move without Government say-so. “Passengers, workers and businesses are suffering and even rail company managers are beginning to break ranks in despair at the Government’s approach. “The minister cannot hide behind this fairy story that he is just a facilitator. “His Government can end this dispute today by taking out the conditions they put in to torpedo a resolution and let the companies make a deal.” Meanwhile, Aslef leaders will consider an offer – made on Friday by the Rail Delivery Group on behalf of train operators – of a 4% pay rise for last year and 4% this year. Conditions were attached to the offer, such as speeding up the training of drivers, as well as over Sunday working arrangements.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The Transport Secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. “They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. “Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation and costing every household an extra £1,000.”",Union leaders to meet rail minister in bid to secure deal to end strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/government-mark-harper-mick-lynch-huw-merriman-rmt-b2258343.html

Last year was chaotic for domestic politics, with upheaval at Westminster and long-running argument at Holyrood on the constitution. Here are just five of the big problems and promises you want sorted for 2023. 1. Fix the NHS NHS Grampian took the desperate step of putting out an urgent social media appeal for staff off-duty or on holiday to come in to work over the festive period. And NHS Highland has warned Raigmore and Belford Hospitals are “very busy” and expressed concerns over a surge in flu patients. Patients across the north and north-east have also struggled to access their GP with one Aberdeen doctor revealing he is seeing three times the safe number of patients “on an almost-daily basis”. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf is facing mounting pressure to come forward with a recovery plan. He says Covid backlogs, rising cases of flu and Strep A, delayed discharged and cold weather are “all compounding” the usual pressures on the health service. The SNP minister is expected to deliver a statement addressing concerns at Holyrood on Tuesday. Meanwhile, NHS Grampian is waiting for an extra £7 million a year required to help more Moray women give birth in Elgin. Campaigners in Caithness continue to raise concerns over the lack of women’s healthcare in the county, with women facing 100-mile journeys to Inverness for treatment. 2. Will the A9 and A96 be dualled? It was confirmed just days before Christmas that a final decision on fully dualling the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness will not be made until well into next year. The SNP promised over a decade ago to dual the route by 2030. But this was thrown into doubt when the Scottish Greens were brought into government in 2021. An open survey of P&J readers, published on January 6, revealed the vast majority of respondents want the A96 dualled all the way. A project to dual the A9 between Inverness and Perth has also been hit by serious delays but the government has yet to give an update on its 2025 target completion date. Pressure on the SNP Government is intensifying after 13 people died on the stretch due to be dualled between the two cities. 3. We need better ferries Furious islanders from the Hebrides to Shetland have warned locals are packing up and quitting their communities in response to the “utterly chaotic” ferry system. The construction of two new ferries, MV Glen Sannox and Hull 802, is well behind schedule and over budget. The vessels, which were originally commissioned in 2015 from struggling shipyard Fergus Marine, are now years late and over a hundred million pounds over budget. The Holyrood inquiry continues but already the SNP is promising more. 4. Whatever happened to Freeports? Three locations across the north-east, Highlands and islands are vying for “green freeport” status from the UK and Scottish governments. Freeports get special tax status and are being promoted as job-creating goldmines. Others fear they are light on regulation and attractive to money launderers. A joint bid by Aberdeen and Peterhead ports is going up against bids by Cromarty Firth and Orkney for the two coveted spots. But bidders have been left in the dark since the summer over who will secure the special tax status, with Scottish Secretary Alister Jack admitting months ago that a decision has already been made. It is understood the ever-changing leadership of the Tory party delayed the announcement last year. 5. What is the future for oil and gas? The SNP conference in October seemed to finally push the future of oil and gas workers to the top of the agenda. Taking place in Aberdeen, Ms Sturgeon said her government has a “duty” to support workers into new green jobs. But there has been a lack of detail on the practicalities. Energy Secretary Michael Matheson is slated to deliver a statement on Scotland’s long-awaited energy strategy and “just transition” plan on Tuesday. The latter will focus on the offshore workforce, Mr Matheson told the Press and Journal last year. Energy policy is reserved to the UK Government and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will have a key role in charting the future of the oil and gas sector, from the licensing of future oil fields to the windfall tax.",5 problems people across the north of Scotland want politicians to fix in 2023,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/5243446/nhs-freeports-a9-a96-oil-gas-ferries/

The deck machinery specialist – based at Towie Barclay Works, near Turriff – is enjoying growth in the offshore floating wind market. Our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Alfie Cheyne, founder and chairman, Ace Winches. Growing demand in energy markets in both North America and the Middle East are also driving the business forward, it said. Ace Winches, whose many accolades over the years include prestigious Queen’s Awards in 2010 and 2013, has formed a subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates as part of its global growth strategy. And earlier this year it announced the opening of a subsidiary in Houston, Texas. Underlying earnings up 38% Chairman Alfie Cheyne said a strong financial performance during the 12 months to March 31 last year was a foundation “which bodes well for the future”. The company reported pre-tax profits of £4.5 million – down from £7.8m for the previous year, when results were boosted by the reversal of a £4.8m write-down. Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation raced ahead to £7.6m last year, up by 38% from £5.5m previously. Ownership tussle The most recent figure excludes one-off costs associated with a change of ownership, Turnover increased slightly to £28.3m, up from just shy of £28m the year before. Ace Winches’ 58-year-old chairman founded the business in 1992 but lost control of it to Balmoral Group in stages between 2017 and 2019. The relationship with Aberdeen-based Balmoral eventually turned sour and Mr Cheyne and his wife, Valerie, reacquired the firm in late 2021. Reflecting on 2021-22, Mr Cheyne said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. “It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is.” He added: “In this reporting period we have made an additional investment of £1.3m in our rental fleet in line with our twin objectives of diversification and geographic expansion. “It has been a year marked by significant growth and change – growth in the renewables market and a change in how we interact with our customers. “This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet, thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Green ambitions Mr Cheyne also highlighted the firm’s green credentials after it became carbon neutral. Operations at Towie Barclay Works are now powered by wind. On the firm’s wider green ambitions, chief commercial officer Gary Wilson said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East are indicators of our strategy going forward.” With more than 3,000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, Ace Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and other services in multiple sectors. Headcount averaged 155 during the 12 months to March 2022, down from 171 the year before. Mrs Cheyne, chief compliance officer, said the company was growing its workforce again. She added: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our graduate engineer numbers, providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.”",Ace Winches sets sights on global growth after &#8216;strong&#8217; results,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/local/5245423/ace-winches-sets-sights-on-global-growth-after-strong-results/

Earlier, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “happy to talk about pay” with unions as ministers held a series of meetings aimed at ending a wave of industrial unrest in the NHS and on the rail network. However, both the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” Unite said any suggestion that a one-off pay reward could be made in exchange for a boost in productivity was “absolutely ludicrous”. While other trade unions said that “progress” had been made, there was no sign that enough had been made for planned strikes to be called off. Unite negotiator Onay Kasab, speaking after a meeting with Mr Barclay, accused the Government of telling staff they would need to “justify” a payment through productivity. “This isn’t a factory we’re talking about, we’re talking about people who are working well beyond their contracted hours anyway just to get the job done because they care so much. “So, for the Government to be talking about productivity in exchange for a (payment) is an insult to every single one of our members.” Mr Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. Alongside talks with health unions, teaching unions were holding talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan ahead of announcements this week over whether their members will go on strike. Rail minister Huw Merriman called in train workers after sustained action crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Mr Kasab said: “I emphasise the thing to get out of today that is absolutely clear is that they want our members to give more in order for it to consider a payment. That is absolutely outrageous.” He said there had been no “detailed” discussion of what a pay settlement might look like, adding that the talks had left him “very angry”. He added: “The Government have missed yet another opportunity. We came here in good faith.” After the meeting, the GMB said that ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday, adding that the talks “fell well short” of anything needed to stop the walk-out. More than 10,000 GMB members are expected by the trade union to take to picket lines on Wednesday. “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis,” said Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary. “The public expects the Government to treat these talks seriously – it’s time they got on with it.” Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, told reporters that “progress” had been made but said there had been no “tangible” concessions. “It was a very civil meeting. We did actually manage to talk about pay – we didn’t get the tangible concessions that we might have hoped for that would enable us to call off the strikes later this week. “But it was definitely progress when you’re in a room with the Secretary of State talking about pay, I think. “He’s asked for our help to help with the Treasury to make the case for investment.

Elaine Sparkes, assistant director at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Although the meeting was more constructive this time, there is nothing tangible on the table. “As such, we’ll be announcing the first of our strike dates later this week as we continue to push for a fairer deal for our members and their colleagues.” The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Government was open to listening to trade unions’ concerns. “We are happy to listen to the pressures they think they are under, what they think is fair, responsible and affordable, and likewise we will provide detail about what we think is affordable, and also the challenge that inflation poses to all of this as well.” Elsewhere, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch dodged questions about progress in rail talks but said that further discussions would take place. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, gave a shrugging gesture as he left the Department for Transport but also declined to give any detail of the meeting. The National Education Union said that “no concrete progress” had been made in its talks with the education secretary. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “While there is the thought of further meetings, there is no sense of concrete progress as yet. There is no offer, there is no change. “There are further discussions to happen that we will engage in while still urging our members to vote in the ballot.” Mr Courtney added: “There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action because we think these meetings are only happening because of the threat of industrial action.” Business Secretary Grant Shapps has said ministers were seeking a more “collaborative approach”, telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “It is a new year. We are very keen to see these strikes come to a conclusion. We want to see a collaborative approach.”",Strikes set to go ahead after ‘insulting’ talks with Health Secretary,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/strikes-set-to-go-ahead-after-insulting-talks-with-health-secretary-b2258736.html

However, both the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” Unite said any suggestion that a one-off pay reward could be made in exchange for a boost in productivity was “absolutely ludicrous”. While other trade unions said that “progress” had been made, there was no sign that enough had been made for planned strikes to be called off. Unite negotiator Onay Kasab, speaking after a meeting with Mr Barclay, accused the Government of telling staff they would need to “justify” a payment through productivity. “This isn’t a factory we’re talking about, we’re talking about people who are working well beyond their contracted hours anyway just to get the job done because they care so much. “So, for the Government to be talking about productivity in exchange for a (payment) is an insult to every single one of our members.” Mr Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. Alongside talks with health unions, teaching unions were holding talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan ahead of announcements this week over whether their members will go on strike. Rail minister Huw Merriman called in train workers after sustained action crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Mr Kasab said: “I emphasise the thing to get out of today that is absolutely clear is that they want our members to give more in order for it to consider a payment. That is absolutely outrageous.” He said there had been no “detailed” discussion of what a pay settlement might look like, adding that the talks had left him “very angry”. He added: “The Government have missed yet another opportunity. We came here in good faith.” After the meeting, the GMB said that ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday, adding that the talks “fell well short” of anything needed to stop the walk-out. More than 10,000 GMB members are expected by the trade union to take to picket lines on Wednesday. “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis,” said Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary. “The public expects the Government to treat these talks seriously – it’s time they got on with it.” Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, told reporters that “progress” had been made but said there had been no “tangible” concessions. “It was a very civil meeting. We did actually manage to talk about pay – we didn’t get the tangible concessions that we might have hoped for that would enable us to call off the strikes later this week. “But it was definitely progress when you’re in a room with the Secretary of State talking about pay, I think. “He’s asked for our help to help with the Treasury to make the case for investment. We’ll certainly do that.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks. Elaine Sparkes, assistant director at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Although the meeting was more constructive this time, there is nothing tangible on the table. “As such, we’ll be announcing the first of our strike dates later this week as we continue to push for a fairer deal for our members and their colleagues.” The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement.

The company, which earlier this year announced the opening of ACE Winches Inc. in Houston, Texas, reported a pre-tax profit of £4.5m, while there was also a slight increase in turnover to £28.3m. ACE Winches Chairman Alfie Cheyne, who, in 2021, returned to the organisation he founded, said the performance gives the company a strong platform to build from. He said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. ""It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is. ""In this reporting period we have made an additional investment of £1.3m in our rental fleet in line with our twin objectives of diversification and geographic expansion. “It has been a year marked by significant growth and change – growth in the renewables market and a change in how we interact with our customers. ""This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success. “We have a long tradition of focusing on the environment, and I am proud to say we reached our goal to be carbon neutral in this past year, with operations at our headquarters having been conducted using wind power.” Chief Financial Officer Alastair Scott added: “The increase in EBITDA excluded one-off costs associated with change of ownership in November 2021, while the figures for the year to March 2021 have also been restated to reverse the effects of a previous financial impairment which is no longer required. “The positive EBITDA results demonstrate the success of the business strategy and allow continued investment into the rental fleet.” Valerie Cheyne, Chief Compliance Officer, said: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our Graduate Engineer numbers providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.” Increasing demand for safe high-quality products and operational delivery in North America and the Middle East has propelled the company’s international strategy and operational activities, which are expected to further strengthen the group’s financial results in 2022/23. As part of that ambition, ACE has formed a subsidiary company in the United Arab Emirates, ensuring the range of high-quality services from concept design through to manufacture, equipment rental and further support, is delivered globally. Chief Commercial Officer Gary Wilson​ said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East, are indicators of our strategy going forward, as we place a focus on areas of opportunity where our capabilities and solutions single us out as a contractor of choice. “We have a strong reputation that has been built up through our commitment to innovation and investing in our people and services over the last 30 years, and we are looking forward to bringing that expertise to more of our customers in North America and the Middle East, as well as markets we already serve.” With more than 3000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, ACE Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and deploying solutions across multiple sectors.

The Jamesfield development is a joint venture with Harmony Energy, following TagEnergy’s acquisition of a 60% stake in the project in November 2021. It will use a system of Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries, together with Tesla’s Autobidder software for real-time trading and control. It is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter this year, with renewable energy company RES as asset manager. Franck Woitiez, chief executive of TagEnergy, said the company's third battery energy storage facility in the UK reinforced its commitment to the country and its green energy goals. “This is another important milestone in TagEnergy’s growth in the UK as we leverage our strong storage expertise to support the UK grid and propel the nation to net-zero carbon emissions by connecting more competitive renewable power. “We are excited to enter this next phase in the project in partnership with Harmony Energy and with the support of Santander UK as we grow our UK footprint to accelerate the energy transition.” Mark Cumbo, director of specialised and project finance at Santander UK, said: “This follows the funding we provided TagEnergy in 2021 to support Hawkers Hill Energy Park in Dorset, and to TagEnergy and Harmony Energy in 2022 for Chapel Farm near Luton. “Santander UK strongly supports clients such as TagEnergy and Harmony Energy that are bringing additional capacity to enable greater contribution from renewables to the UK’s energy sector.” Peter Kavanagh, chief executive of Harmony Energy, said: “We have been working on this site for over four years and are delighted to be progressing to this next stage with TagEnergy, following our partnership which was announced in 2021. “Securing debt funding from Santander UK demonstrates a growing appetite from institutions to support battery developments and we look forward to working with it.” Jamesfield is the third TagEnergy investment in battery storage facilities in the UK to reach financial close following its entry into the UK market in 2021. Commissioning of its first project, Hawkers Hill Energy Park, took place in September and construction of its second project, Chapel Farm, started last February. Jamesfield, Chapel Farm and Hawkers Hill, together with previously-announced projects Roaring Hill in Fife, Lakeside in North Yorkshire and more recently, Pitkevy in Scotland, take TagEnergy’s secured portfolio in the UK to date to 320MW/640MWh. TagEnergy partnered with Balance Power in October to build, own, and operate 500MW of Balance Power’s renewable energy pipeline requiring an investment of more than £300m over the next four years. Since its formation in 2019, TagEnergy has assembled a portfolio of close to 4GW based on solar, wind and battery storage technologies in the UK, Portugal, Spain, France and Australia.

Kasey, who joins with over five years of experience in digital marketing, will lead the marketing arm of the agency, advising clients on digital marketing strategy. She also joins the senior leadership team at JUMP as marketing the business itself becomes a Board priority for the company. Following a successful digital marketing apprenticeship, Alana has been offered a full-time role as a marketing assistant. RHA Railway Housing Association has appointed Matthew Sugden as its new Chief Executive. Matthew will officially take up the role in April upon the retirement of Anne Rowlands, who has spent the last 14 years as the Association’s CEO. He is currently Executive Director for Governance and Strategy at Accent Housing, a national housing association. After working in private practice as a solicitor, Matthew has spent his entire 18-year housing career at Accent, initially joining as a Solicitor before becoming Head of Legal and then Executive Director for Governance and Business Assurance in 2018 before taking up his current role in 2021, with responsibility for the people, strategy, communications, insight, health and safety, legal and governance, procurement and business assurance teams. Matthew Sugden (Image: Press release) During his four years as an Executive Director, Matthew has led on the introduction of Best Companies which resulted in Accent being a two-star organisation and top 100 company to work for in 2022. He has also sat on Regulator of Social Housing’s Tenant Satisfaction Measures Steering Group as the Northern Housing Consortium representative and reset Accent’s Governance Framework to ensure a strong resident voice within Accent’s strategic decision-making process. At Railway Housing Association he will lead a staff team of 38 who are responsible for delivering services to people living in over 1,600 homes in 24 local authority areas. Matthew said: “I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to lead Railway Housing Association, an organisation with a proud and rich history. I look forward to building on the great work that Anne has done over the last 14 years and working with colleagues to continue to deliver excellent services for our residents.” Chris Fawcett, Chair of the Railway Housing Board, said: “We are delighted to have been able to attract someone of Matthew’s calibre to Railway Housing Association. “His knowledge and experience will prove invaluable as we continue to deliver our business strategy for the benefit of our residents and address the challenges we face in the future, including meeting Government targets on carbon emissions. “The Board and everyone else at Railway Housing Association would like to thank Anne for her tireless service and the important contribution she has made.” NEAA The North East Automotive Alliance, the cluster supporting the region’s automotive supply chain, has appointed Mark David to a key role. As Skills Project Manager Mark, who previously worked at Business Durham, will lead on the North East Local Skills Improvement Plan, an employer-led plan that meets future business needs and provides a resilient and responsive supply of the skills needed to drive economic success and investment in the region. Initially, Mark will be 100% dedicated to the NELSIP, ensuring the plan is managed and delivered, and he will move to support further NEAA membership skills activity later in 2023. Mark has more than ten years’ experience in the skills and education sector, including over six years at the Construction Industry Training Board, working on current and future training needs, which included digitalisation of the construction sector and developing new qualifications for emerging areas of construction. Paul Butler, NEAA’s CEO said of Mark’s appointment: “I’m delighted to welcome Mark into the NEAA team. He brings a wealth of experience in skills, training and development having worked at CITB, but in addition to this, he understands the funding landscape and SME business support, which is valuable to a cluster.

It follows recent articles on inflation, energy, food and the cost of living. Canada: assertive unions getting results Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Canada’s trade union movement is among the more resilient in the OECD, the club of developed countries. This is related to laws that prevent “free riding”, which is where workers can benefit from collective agreements without being union members. Union density in Canada has been around 30% of workers since the turn of the century, although membership in the private sector is barely half that and slowly falling. In contrast, unionisation is high in public services (over 75%) and growing. This relatively stability has left Canadian workers better prepared to confront the impact of inflation on their wages. Unions made higher wage demands than in recent decades, and more frequently went on strike (continuing a trend from 2021). From January to October 2022, there were 145 strikes, and the final year tally will likely exceed the 161 in 2021 – itself a marked increase. A total of 1.9 million person-days of work were lost in strikes up to October (the highest in 15 years). Unlike in recent years, the majority were in the private sector. A spring wave of strikes in construction in Ontario (Canada’s most populous province) symbolised the increased militancy. At peak, over 40,000 workers downed tools for higher wages, including carpenters, dry-wallers and engineers. Tentative agreements reached by officials were sometimes rejected by members, prolonging the strikes. A second historic flash point came later in the year when Ontario’s right-wing government invoked a rarely used constitutional clause to override the right to strike for 55,000 education support workers. After unions in the public and private sector threatened a province-wide general strike, the government backed down. Meanwhile, employer lockouts have virtually disappeared. This tactic, in which employers suspend operations until workers agree to terms being offered, had only been used eight times by October, compared to 60 per year a decade ago. Annual wage growth increased modestly to an average of 5% by late in the year. That still lagged the 6.8% inflation, but closed the gap from 2021. It remains to be seen whether this union pressure can be sustained in the face of rapid interest rate increases, a likely recession in 2023, and continued government suppression of union rights in some provinces. United Kingdom: an olive branch for the health service? Phil Tomlinson, Professor of Industrial Strategy, University of Bath The UK’s latest winter of discontent is extending into 2023 as the country endures its largest wave of strikes in over 30 years. Most are in the public sector, where pay offers are well below inflation and significantly lag private companies. The sense of grievance is high following the austerity and real-terms pay cuts of the 2010s. Strikes – estimated to have cost the UK economy £1.7 billion in 2022 – are being co-ordinated across different unions, adding to the public inconvenience. The UK government has steadfastly refused to yield, however. It has hidden behind independent recommendations by public-sector pay review bodies, despite not always following them. They have also claimed that inflation matching public sector pay rises would cost each UK household an extra £1,000 a year, though this figure has been debunked. The Treasury also echoes Bank of England concerns about setting off a wage-price spiral. Yet this is unlikely, given the current inflation is largely down to supply shocks (from COVID and the war in Ukraine), while average wage growth is well below inflation. There is an economic case for a generous deal, especially in the National Health Service (NHS): with over 133,000 unfilled vacancies, better wages might help improve staff retention and recruitment. Of course, funding this in a recession involves tough choices. Higher taxes would be politically difficult with the tax burden at a 70-year high. Higher government borrowing could aggravate inflation if accommodated by the Bank of England increasing the money supply through more quantitative easing. Public opinion appears largely sympathetic to the strikes, especially in the NHS. But if the government relents in one sector, it sets a precedent for others, with potentially wider economic consequences. For the NHS, it may instead bring forward public sector pay review body negotiations for 2023 to allow for an improved deal – possibly alongside a one-off hardship payment. Elsewhere it will probably hold firm and hope the trade unions lose their resolve. Australia and New Zealand: strikes remain rare despite inflation Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Strikes in Australia have become very rare in recent decades, thanks to restrictive labour laws passed since the 1990s. Despite historically low unemployment and wages lagging far behind inflation, these laws continue to short-circuit most industrial action. In 2022, union density fell to 12.5% of employees, an all-time low. As recently as 1990, union density was over 50% of workers. Union members can legally strike only after negotiations, ballots and specific plans for action have been publicly divulged (thus fully revealing union strategy to the employer). Even when there are strikes, they tend to be short. A total of 182 industrial disputes occurred in the year to September. (The statistics don’t distinguish between strikes and employer lockouts, which have become common in Australia.) This is similar to the pre-COVID years, following a drop in 2020, and only a fraction of 1970s and 1980s industrial action. The only visible increase in strike action in 2022 was a series of one-day protest strikes organised by teachers and health care workers in New South Wales, the country’s most populous state. Having put up with a decade of austere wage caps by the conservative state government, they decided they had had enough as inflation picked up. Most other workers have been passive despite Australia experiencing among the slowest wage growth of any major industrial country. Nominal wages grew just 2% per year over the decade to 2021. That rose to 3.1% by late 2022, but it’s still less than half the 7.3% inflation rate. Australia’s newly elected Labor government did pass a series of important labour law reforms at the end of 2022, aimed at strengthening collective bargaining and wage growth. That might herald incremental improvement in workers’ bargaining power in the years ahead. The industrial relations outlook in New Zealand is somewhat more hospitable for workers and their unions. Union density increased in 2021, to 17% of employees (from 14% in 2020). Average ordinary hourly earnings grew an impressive 7.4% in the latest 12-month period – helped by a 6% boost in the minimum wage by New Zealand’s Labour government. Industrial action remains rare – perhaps in part because workers are successfully lifting wages via other means. No official strike data is available for 2022, but in 2021, just 20 work stoppages occurred, down sharply from an average of 140 per year in the previous three years. Indonesia: anger against labour law reforms Nabiyla Risfa Izzati, Lecturer of Labour Law, Universitas Gadjah Mada A few weeks ago, the government replaced its controversial “omnibus law” with new emergency regulation. This was in response to the Indonesian constitutional court finding it unconstitutional in 2021. Passed in late 2020, the omnibus law embodies President Joko Widodo’s ambition to attract foreign investors by slashing red tape at the cost of employees’ rights. It made it easier for businesses to lay off employees without prior notice. It also lowered statutory severance pay and extended the maximum length of temporary contracts, while ignoring worker safety. In 2022, its new formula to determine the minimum wage also resulted in the lowest annual increase ever. The law attracted much criticism from workers, activists and civil society organisations. The new emergency regulation is arguably even more problematic. The majority of its provision simply copies the omnibus law. Several changes and additional provisions are confusing and overlap with previous regulations, as well as leaving many loopholes that could be exploited in future. Yet despite complaints from workers and trade unions that the new rules were passed suddenly and without consultation, strike action is out of the question. Strikes are not popular because they can only be organised with permission from the company in question. If labourers hold informal strikes, employers also entitled to get rid of them. Public protests are the obvious alternative, though pandemic rules restricting mobility and mass gatherings have made these difficult. Nevetheless, thousands or perhaps even millions of workers staged protests in their respective cities in the second half of 2022. The workers wanted the omnibus law revoked, and for the government to not use the minimum wage formulations stipulated in the law. The demonstrations got more intense as the government raised subsidised fuel prices in September, which boosted already high inflation due to rising food prices. The government has since issued a separate regulation to determine the 2023 minimum wage, so the demands were successful, although both workers and employers are furious that the minimum wage rules have changed again under the emergency regulation. Clearly the protesters did not see the rest of the rules in the omnibus law removed. Some workers have been protesting on social media. This might not induce the government to change the law, but a few viral tweets have pushed several businesses to change abusive practices. The controversy is likely to continue in 2023 and into the election year of 2024, especially amid possible massive layoffs in the midst of a global recession. United States: worker protest showing signs of life Marick Masters, Professor of Business and Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Wayne State University US workers organised and took to the picket line in increased numbers in 2022 to demand better pay and working conditions, leading to optimism among labour leaders and advocates that they’re witnessing a turnaround in labour’s sagging fortunes. Teachers, journalists and baristas were among tens of thousands of workers who went on strike. And it took an act of Congress to prevent 115,000 railroad employees from walking out as well. In total, there have been at least 20 major work stoppages involving upwards of 1,000 workers each in 2022, up from 16 in 2021, plus hundreds more that were smaller. Workers at Starbucks, Amazon, Apple and dozens of other companies also filed over 2,000 petitions to form unions during the year – the most since 2015. Workers won 76% of the 1,363 elections that were held. Historically, however, these figures are tepid. The number of major work stoppages has been plunging for decades, from nearly 200 as recently as 1980. As of 2021, union membership was at about the lowest level on record, at 10.3%. In the 1950s, over one in three workers belonged to a union. The deck is still heavily stacked against unions, with unsupportive labour laws and very few employers showing real receptivity to having a unionised workforce. Unions are limited in how much they can change public policy. Reforming labour law through legislation has remained elusive, and the results of the 2022 midterms are not likely to make it easier. Nonetheless, public support for labour is at its highest since 1965, with 71% saying they approve of unions, according to a Gallup poll in August. And workers themselves are increasingly showing an interest in joining them. In 2017, 48% of workers polled said they would vote for union representation, up from 32% in 1995, the last time the question was asked. Future success may depend on unions’ ability to tap into their growing popularity and emulate the recent wins in establishing union representation at Starbucks and Amazon, as well as the successful “Fight for $15” campaign, which since 2012 has helped pass US$15 minimum wage laws in a dozen states and Washington DC. The odds may be steep, but the seeds of opportunity are there if labour can exploit them. This is an excerpt from an article published on January 5 2023. France: militant unions risk going too far Stéphanie Matteudi-Lecocq, Chercheuse au LEREDS, Directrice practice Chez Alixio, Université de Lille France in 2022 saw new industrial protests, from blockades of oil refineries, to unprecedented strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants, to rail workers staying at home on public holidays. TotalEnergies announced “super profits” in the second quarter of 2022 and increased CEO Patrick Pouyanné’s salary by 52% to €5,944,129. In September the militant CGT union demanded a 10% salary increase for workers and called for a strike at the group’s refineries. Five of Total’s refineries went on strike, joined by two owned by ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso. Esso was already talking to its unions about a pay deal, but Total had only planned to open negotiations in November. The strikes in the refineries threatened to bring France to a standstill, and the CGT used its power over this key resource to demand that discussions begin more quickly with Total (in the end, the company negotiated earlier and pay deals were done, ending the strikes by early November). The strike at EDF’s nuclear power stations similarly gave the company’s workers the balance of power because it made it impossible for France to build up energy reserves (since fossil fuels had to be burned to make up for the lack of nuclear power). In the end, the company signed deals with the unions in October. Unions may have succeeded in both cases, but they are arguably endangered by these kinds of practices. Too many trades union leaders remain stuck in their old militant ways. There’s a fragile balance between negotiation and protest, and such ransom tactics might damage unions’ public image, making dialogue more difficult in future. In 50 years, the rate of unionisation in France has already halved from over 20% to around 10%. It’s telling that two of the major strikes at the end of 2022, first by train workers and then by general practitioners, were initiated by groups independent from the unions. They both started spontaneously through social media and the unions found out very late. In 2023 the unions have an opportunity to improve their influence if they manage to prevent the government from passing its unpopular bill on pensions, which seeks to raise the full pensionable retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65. The unions have already announced their strong opposition to the bill. With major demonstrations due to take place after the full bill is presented today, January 10, it will be interesting to see their tactics. This is based on an excerpt from an article published in October 2022. Spain: unequal support measures could cause trouble Rubén Garrido-Yserte, Director del Instituto Universitario de Análisis Económico y Social, Universidad de Alcalá Global inflation is triggering a global economic slowdown and interest rates raised to levels not seen since before 2008. Interest rates will continue to rise in 2023, especially affecting economies as indebted as Spain. It will undermine both families’ disposable income and the profitability of companies (especially small ones), while making public debt repayments more expensive. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to cause a sustained increase in the cost of the shopping basket in the medium term. Government measures have partially mitigated this loss of purchasing power so far. Spain capped power prices, subsidised fuel and made public transport free for urbanites and commuters. There were agreements with banks to refinance mortgages for the most vulnerable families. Plus there have been increases in pensions and public salaries and there are plans to raise the minimum wage. However, many of these measures must necessarily be temporary. The danger is that they come to be seen as rights that should not be renounced. They also distort the economy and create problems with fairness by excluding or insufficiently supporting some groups. Private salaries will not rise enough to cover inflation, for instance. The government’s measures have been such that there has been very little industrial action in response to the cost of living crisis. The danger is that they create a scenario where today’s calm may be the harbinger of a social storm tomorrow.

Ms Somerville said there is still “some distance” between the two sides in the pay dispute. On Tuesday, primary schools around the country closed after last-ditch talks failed to prevent strike action, with secondary school staff set to walk out on Wednesday. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. A meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT), which brings together unions, local authorities and the Scottish Government, took place on Monday in an attempt to avert the strike action. As the Scottish Parliament resumed following the winter recess, Conservative Stephen Kerr spoke about the SNCT meeting. He said: “Teachers are on strike for the first time in 40 years, because this SNP Government has repeatedly let them down.” Ms Somerville said it had been “constructive”, adding that she could not give further details while negotiations are ongoing. Referring to “anti-trade union” legislation at Westminster, she continued: “I will take no lectures from Mr Kerr or any other Conservative member of this parliament, saying that we should be doing more to actually settle disputes.” The Lib Dems’ Willie Rennie asked if there would be a new offer for teachers, saying: “The Education Secretary does seem to be very chilled out and relaxed.” Ms Somerville said both sides in the dispute would have to compromise in order to reach a resolution, adding: “We will, of course, leave no stone unturned to try and do that as quickly as possible. “No one wants to see strike action in our schools.” Speaking on BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland programme earlier, Ms Somerville described the union pay demands as “simply unaffordable”.

Asked whether she expected a new offer to be on the table before the end of the week, Ms Somerville said: “We’ll continue discussions with the unions. “I think the challenge that we have is we remain some distance apart on what the Scottish Government and local government can afford and can put on the table from the union demand which is, of course, a 10% increase in pay. “If that had been accepted, if the 5% had been accepted, you would’ve actually seen teachers have a 21.8% cumulative rise since 2018. “So we’re trying very hard to have a fair and affordable package on the table but we do remain unfortunately some distance apart.” She added: “The pay demands we’re having from our trade union colleagues are simply unaffordable for the Scottish Government working on a fixed budget, already allocated, also eroded by inflation and that does make it a very difficult and challenging process to come to a conclusion and resolution on.” Earlier in the programme, Mike Corbett, NASUWT Scotland national official, echoed the concerns that unions and Government were still far away from agreement on pay. He said the last offer made in November was “dressed up as an improved offer” but did not improve pay for the “vast majority of teachers”. He added: “There’s still no formal revised offer on the table and that is the reason why our members and others feel they’ve got no alternative but to be out on strike again today and tomorrow.” Nicola Sturgeon also spoke to journalists about the strike on Tuesday. The First Minister said: “I deeply regret that we have industrial action in our schools. “I don’t think that’s in the interest of young people at all. “That said, I understand the strength of feeling of teachers and we highly value the teaching profession.” However, she said: “I can’t create additional funding that we don’t have and I’ve tried to be really honest with unions across the public sector. “We’re trying to be as fair as possible while maximising pay increases.”",Somerville: No stone will be left unturned in bid to resolve school strikes,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/scottish-government-teachers-education-secretary-scottish-parliament-conservative-b1052061.html

The Tees Valley New Creatives programme, initially set up in 2021 to help young people in the creative industries start on the path to a rewarding career in the face of coronavirus, will be one of the first to benefit. Its success has seen it expand to give more people newly out of training a leg-up to secure work, forge connections and unlock new opportunities in their field. We're holding the first BUSINESSiQ Awards - to nominate someone, CLICK HERE Stockton’s ARC, which is delivering the programme, will also pilot a scheme to help cultural organisations develop strong leadership and governance, bringing leaders together to provide peer support and work together to solve industry challenges for the first time. A package of measures led by Clore Leadership will be delivered to address workforce development and training, including workshops and mentoring, to give people and organisations the skills they need to grow and succeed. The final strand of funding will bolster the region’s already strong slate of events, building on last year’s £1.6million Festivals Scale-Up programme to establish a network of festivals and boost volunteering. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “From young new talent to our industry leaders and the workforce in between, this funding will work right across the sector at every level. “It will help local people into good-quality, well-paid careers in culture and the arts, and give those already working in it the skills and chance to go on to bigger and better things Read next: Level Up - speaking out to support business as The Echo has done for 150 years Appointments: Key moves at leading companies across the North East Leading construction business backs BUSINESSiQ Awards night “Ultimately, like everything we’re working to do, this will give organisations the opportunity to grow, create jobs and make Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool even better places to live and do business.” Cllr Shane Moore, Combined Authority Cabinet Lead for Culture and Tourism and Leader of Hartlepool Borough Council, said: “We have a wealth of culture talent in our region, and a calendar of fantastic events and festivals that draw people from far and wide. “This funding will help us make a step-change in how the sector operates, ensuring these bodies and festivals can become much more than the sum of their parts and deliver even more great work.” The full programme of the Clore Leadership activity will be launched on 31 January from 1.30pm at Darlington’s Theatre Hullabaloo.

Gareth Davies, the auditor and comptroller general at the NAO, said keeping on top of conflicts of interest was a “crucial part of public stewardship” that was not always followed during the VIP fast lane process. He said the government had given detailed responses on how it would improve its processes after reports from the NAO and others highlighting a failure to adhere to basic standards of procurement when awarding some contracts during the pandemic. But the auditor general said the NAO was watching closely to make sure its recommendations on procurement and pandemic preparedness “do not get lost” as the government deals with other crises such as Ukraine and high energy prices. “We are always careful to recognise the exceptional circumstances but despite the intense pressure it is always necessary to cover basic areas of transparency,” Davies said. “Publishing what you’ve done within the normal timescales is still possible even in an emergency and the whole process around conflicts of interest. “You may well need a speeded up system for referring plausible suppliers of PPE into the system but you should absolutely insist that people should declare it if they have a private interest in that supplier, particularly if they are holding a position of authority or responsibility like a peer or an MP or a senior civil servant. That just couldn’t be demonstrated. “There were clearly people attempting to do that at different stages but there wasn’t a clear trail of how that had been handled. The reason was the sheer pressure of the emergency but you can see now where that leads you if you are not careful.” His comments come after the scandal over Mone, on a leave of absence as a Conservative peer, who is the subject of an inquiry over her alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro during the pandemic. She has vowed to clear her name. Davies gave his assessment after the NAO carried out 36 detailed reports on the £300bn of government’s spending during the Covid pandemic. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the NAO was looking carefully at resilience to help the UK become better financially prepared for events that may require big public spending, guarding against the “collective failure of imagination” to prepare adequately for a major pandemic. He said there would be better “stress testing” of emergency responses, and the NAO would look at preparedness across the board, asking: “How do you avoid being caught out by this?” “You could argue it has happened on more than just Covid. What’s happening on energy is pretty unprecedented and needs another emergency scheme developed at high speed from scratch. We don’t want to have to do that every time,” he said. Davies also warned about the effects of inflation on public sector budgets, especially major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and roads, as well as highlighting the risks that the NHS will not meet its targets on eliminating waits of longer than a year by 2025. Davies said the NAO has been pointing out the “headwinds that the NHS is facing in implementing the planned approach” to waiting lists as well as highlighting the “numbers that the plan was based on assumed the best case scenario … not a severe winter in cases of flu and … [without] the industrial action that is currently under way”. He said the NAO’s report from November highlighted “serious risks” in meeting the 2025 target on eliminating waits of longer than 12 months and its job was now to monitor progress and “help identify barriers to getting through the backlog faster”. “Clearly, a lot of those risks that we identified are still present,” he added. Rishi Sunak recommitted to the NHS waiting list targets last week as one of his major priorities. Davies said inflation was a major risk to the NHS budget as well as departments with exposure to construction costs such as “HS2 and the other rail and road improvement schemes”. Warning that the government has “difficult decisions” ahead on major infrastructure projects, he said it was possible to reduce the scope of some projects or make the case for more money but on others said: “You either do it or you don’t: you have a have binary choice there. So there are some very difficult decisions for government.” Davies said HS2 was a “good example where the legs that have currently been committed to are going to cost more than when the most recent decision to recommit to the schemes was taken, so that’s going to have to be taken into account in one way or another, either through additional funding or through looking at the future scope of the scheme”.","MPs and peers should declare links to firms they back for contracts, says NAO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/mps-and-peers-should-declare-links-to-firms-they-back-for-contracts-says-nao

With the economy set to enter recession, the nation’s productivity puzzle will be a key challenge for the Prime Minister and businesses to overcome in the year ahead. “Productivity has a huge impact on the economy and people’s standard of living. But growing NHS waiting lists, diminishing access to treatment and surging economic inactivity due to ill-health are all weighing on productivity in the UK. “Businesses that proactively implement effective incentivisation and employee benefits programmes throughout their entire workforce will be best placed to retain staff, drive better performance and grow in a post-Covid landscape.”UK bank NatWest has announced a new package of Cost of Living support measures, including £5.7m of funding for charities and partners.NatWest is giving £1m to the Trussell Trust, the food bank charity, to support the Help through Hardship scheme, plus over £1.6m to the debt advice sector; £900k for Responsible Finance to support provision of accessible credit to people; and a £1m partnership with Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) to provide cost of living support.NatWest is also giving struggling customers more time to repay debts, it says: From early February this year, where customers have missed several payments on an unsecured debt such as a loan or overdraft, the bank will extend the time for them to repay their debt from 18 to 24 months, giving them more time and flexibility.

Régis Schultz, the chief executive of JD, said young shoppers had more cash in their pockets than a year ago thanks to the reopening of retail and hospitality which had provided jobs, while inflation had prompted people to go out and buy instead of waiting for bargains.

Heathrow says this is the highest passenger increase of any airport in Europe, “and possibly worldwide”.But it warns:We are concerned that the recovery of the aviation sector, which is critical to the economy, could be set back by the reintroduction of testing for travellers in the UK and elsewhere in response to increasing COVID levels in China, even though governments acknowledge there is no scientific basis for doing so.UK prime minister Rishi Sunak decided to introduce tests on arrivals from China at the end of December, after other countries including the US and Italy brought in similar measures.But scientists told the Observer that screening people coming from China would make little difference, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the UK was already very high, while airport checks had been shown to be unreliable in pinpointing disease carriers.Sunak’s U-turn on China Covid tests is a political move, say scientistsRead moreIf there is to be a correction in UK house prices, it will be driven by the homeowners whose fixed rate mortgage deals are set to expire over the next 12 months, says Zainab Atiyyah, analyst at Third Bridge.Mortgage and Bank of England interest rates started to increase during 2022 – and at least 1.4 millionUK households face the prospect of interest rate rises when they renew their fixed rate mortgages this year.➡️ https://t.co/HwWjla2Iwl pic.twitter.com/QKvIRIYbOU— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 9, 2023 But the UK’s “massive undersupply of new-build and second-hand houses.” will cushion that effect, Atiyyah points out.“Overall, our experts expect a slowdown in sales to continue in 2023 despite new stamp duty thresholds, as supply continues to dwindle.” “Those on Help to Buy deals will be crossing their fingers and hoping their deals don’t fall apart as new homes are delayed or not completed by the end of the year.

It has helped three thousand customers deal with burst pipes, water tanks and other related damage.Direct Line says:This, together with the freeze event from January 2022 and subsidence related claims over the summer means that we currently expect total weather claims to be in the region of £140 million for 2022, well above our 2022 expectation of £73 million.Direct Line’s motor insurance division also saw an increase in third party claims inflation during the fourth quarter of last year, and more claims in the quarter --partly due to adverse weather conditions.Shares in Direct Line have tumbled 28%, to 166p.JD Sports has also predicted its profits will be towards the top end of expectations, following a jump in sales over Christmas.JD Sports’ revenues grew by over 10% in the 22 weeks to 31 December 2022, accelerating to more than 20% in the six-weeks to 31 December 2022.It now expects pre-tax profits for the year to 28 January to be “towards the top end” of market expectations (£933m to £985m), although the final performance depends how the post-Christmas sales go.Shares in JD Sports have jumped 4.6% in early trading, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.Record sales of Champagne and prosecco have helped to push profits at Sainsbury’s to the upper end of forecasts.The supermarket chain has reported that profits this year are expected to be towards the upper end of its guidance range of £630m to £690m, although still below last year’s profits of £730m.J Sainsbury’s retail sales, excluding fuel, rose by 5.2% year-on-year in its third quarter (to 7th January). Grocery sales were 5.6% higher – and 12.5% ahead of pre-pandemic levels.And in the Christmas period, sales rose 7.1%, with grocery sales up 7.1%, general merchandise sales up 7.4% and clothing sales up 5.1%.That included a 22% jump in Taste the Difference Mince Pies, and a 49% rise in Taste the Difference Panettone, while there was “record sales for Champagne and prosecco”.But Simon Roberts, chief executive of J Sainsbury, flags that 2023 will be tough for households.“We understand money will be exceptionally tight this year particularly as many people wait for Christmas bills to land.

Rishi Sunak had previously refused to say whether he uses private healthcare, insisting it was ""not really relevant"". It followed a press report that Mr Sunak is registered with a private GP practice which charges £250 per consultation. At PMQs, Mr Sunak praised his local hospital ""for the fantastic care they have given my family"". ""That's why I'm passionately committed to protecting it with more funding, more doctors and nurses, and a clear plan to cut the waiting lists,"" he added. Mr Sunak had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that his healthcare was ""a personal choice"". ""As a general policy I wouldn't ever talk about me or my family's healthcare situation … it's not really relevant,"" he told the programme. Registering with an NHS GP does not exclude someone from using private healthcare. The prime minister's spokeswoman said Mr Sunak did not currently have private cover but declined to say when he registered with the NHS. ""In principle, he believes that the personal health details of individuals should remain private, but given the level of interest and in the interests of transparency he has set out that he is registered with a NHS GP,"" she said. A newspaper report in November suggested Mr Sunak was registered with a private GP practice that offers on-the-day appointments and home visits. Latest NHS figures show that in November last year, 58% of NHS patients were not seen on the day they made an appointment. At the same time, a record high of more than seven million people are waiting for hospital treatment. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in response to Mr Sunak's comments that the prime minister ""will find out what it's like to wait on hold at 08:00 as you call for an appointment"". Sir Keir's spokesman confirmed the Labour leader had never used private healthcare. He said he was ""not going to comment on individual health choices"" and Labour was focused on ""ensuring we have the best possible NHS"" for everyone in the country. Sir Keir also clashed with Mr Sunak over the government's plan for new legislation to enforce minimum service levels in the NHS and other key sectors. The Tories had gone ""from clapping nurses to sacking nurses"", Sir Keir said, adding that nurses and ambulance workers would not be on strike if the prime minister had negotiated. The prime minister said Sir Keir would not agree to minimum service levels in the NHS ""because he's on the side of his union paymasters, not patients"". Mr Sunak added that he wanted ""to have constructive dialogue with the unions"" and had accepted the recommendations of independent pay review bodies. Earlier, health unions announced they are pulling out of the NHS Pay Review Body process to determine pay for next year. The 14 unions - representing more than one million ambulance staff, nurses and other NHS workers in England - have called for direct negotiations with ministers about pay. Mr Sunak's comments followed Health Secretary Steve Barclay confirming he used an NHS doctor. Pressed on whether he has NHS care during an interview on LBC, Mr Barclay replied: ""Yes, I don't subscribe to private provision. ""But I don't have a problem with people, with their own money, who wish to spend that money on private healthcare. ""I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing for people to want to do."" Some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have made a point of drawing attention to their use of the NHS when they were prime minister. David Cameron often spoke about how the NHS cared for his disabled son, while Boris Johnson said the health service saved his life after he fell seriously ill with Covid. But when Mrs Thatcher was prime minister she was candid about her use of private health insurance, which she said was vital for her to ""go into hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want"".",PMQs: Rishi Sunak says he is registered with NHS doctor,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64237830?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Mr Kerr slammed the SNP for treating experienced workers as being easily replaceable after the report stated “the age profile of oil and gas workers means a significant proportion are expected to retire” during the First Minister’s acceleration of closing the industry. The energy strategy added it is positive that fewer young people were entering the sector, stating 12 per cent of the oil and gas workforce is under 30. This is despite warnings from the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board that more workers are required to meet future levels of labour demand. But the SNP’s aim of closing down the sector is at odds with what their Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, believes after he said last year that investment in North Sea oil and gas was vital for jobs in Aberdeen. Mr Kerr, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for net zero, energy and transport, said: “The SNP is threatening to destroy the lives of oil and gas workers with its uninformed intention of closing down the sector at its earliest point. “The assertion that the majority of these workers will be retiring is utterly reckless and a slap in the face to those who have dedicated years of service to such a valuable industry to our north-east economy. “This report implies it is a good thing fewer young people are entering the sector when all the evidence points to the very opposite as more people are needed to cope with labour demand. “The negative narrative of this is putting our younger generation off from having a long, productive career in an industry which supports countries worldwide. “Oil and gas is essential to securing our energy supply while also protecting tens of thousands of Scottish jobs. Yet this SNP energy strategy completely undermines the sector which will result in us relying on more expensive imports which do more damage to the environment. “This last week, many north-east residents watched in horror as a baleful, unnatural force threatened to hamper the livelihoods of North Sea workers. “After Nicola Sturgeon’s bid to toss more than 70,000 oil and gas jobs in the skip and wreck the energy transition, they should probably give it another week before trying to watch The Rig as well.” Do you want to respond to this article?

This is as true of climate chaos as anything else. We are hemmed in by stories that prevent us from seeing, or believing in, or acting on the possibilities for change. Some are habits of mind, some are industry propaganda. Sometimes, the situation has changed but the stories haven’t, and people follow the old versions, like outdated maps, into dead ends. We need to leave the age of fossil fuel behind, swiftly and decisively. But what drives our machines won’t change until we change what drives our ideas. The visionary organiser adrienne maree brown wrote not long ago that there is an element of science fiction in climate action: “We are shaping the future we long for and have not yet experienced. I believe that we are in an imagination battle.” In order to do what the climate crisis demands of us, we have to find stories of a livable future, stories of popular power, stories that motivate people to do what it takes to make the world we need. Perhaps we also need to become better critics and listeners, more careful about what we take in and who’s telling it, and what we believe and repeat, because stories can give power – or they can take it away. To change our relationship to the physical world – to end an era of profligate consumption by the few that has consequences for the many – means changing how we think about pretty much everything: wealth, power, joy, time, space, nature, value, what constitutes a good life, what matters, how change itself happens. As the climate journalist Mary Heglar writes, we are not short on innovation. “We’ve got loads of ideas for solar panels and microgrids. While we have all of these pieces, we don’t have a picture of how they come together to build a new world. For too long, the climate fight has been limited to scientists and policy experts. While we need their skills, we also need so much more. When I survey the field, it’s clear that what we desperately need is more artists.” What the climate crisis is, what we can do about it, and what kind of a world we can have is all about what stories we tell and whose stories are heard. Climate change was a story that fell on mostly indifferent ears when it was first discussed in the mainstream more than 30 years ago. Even a dozen years ago, it was supposed to be happening very slowly and in the distant future. There were a lot of references to “our grandchildren’s time”. It was a problem that was difficult to grasp – this dispersed, incremental, atmospheric, invisible, global problem with many causes and manifestations, whose solutions are also dispersed and manifold. That voices from the climate movement have finally succeeded in making the vast majority understand it, and many care passionately about it, might be the biggest single victory the movement will have. Because once you’ve won the popular imagination, you’ve changed the game and its possible outcomes. But this was a long, slow, arduous process, and misconceptions still abound. A lot of people don’t know that we’ve largely won the battle to make people aware and concerned. The LA Times ran a well-intentioned editorial last year about how most Americans don’t care about climate breakdown. That was true once, but no longer is. A Pew Research poll in 2020 concluded that two-thirds of Americans wanted to see more government action on climate, but last summer the scientific journal Nature published a study concluding that most Americans believe that only a minority (37-43%) support climate action, when in reality a large majority (66-80%) does. That gap between perceived and actual support undermines motivation and confidence. We need better stories – and sometimes better means more up to date. Outright climate denial – the old story that climate change isn’t real – has been rendered largely obsolete (outside social media) by climate-driven catastrophes around the globe and good work by climate activists and journalists. But other stories still stop us from seeing clearly. Greenwashing – the schemes created by fossil fuel corporations and others to portray themselves as on the environment’s side while they continue their profitable destruction – is rampant. It’s harder to recognise a false friend than an honest enemy, and their false solutions, delaying tactics and empty promises can be confusing for non-experts. Fortunately, as the climate movement has diversified, one new organisation, Clean Creatives, focuses specifically on pressuring advertising and PR agencies to stop doing the industry’s dirty work. Likewise, climate journalists are exposing how fossil fuel money is funding pseudo-environmental opposition to offshore wind turbines. (As the climate activist and oil policy analyst Antonia Juhasz recently told me, the climate movement is now going after every aspect of the fossil fuel industry, including funding by banks and, via the divestment movement, shares held by investors; donations to politicians; insurers; permits for extraction; transport; refinement; emissions, notably through lawsuits concerning their impact; shutting coal-fired power plants; and pushing for a rapid transition to electrification.) But we still lack stories that give context. For example, I see people excoriate the mining, principally for lithium and cobalt, that will be an inevitable part of building renewables – turbines, batteries, solar panels, electric machinery – apparently oblivious to the far vaster scale and impact of fossil fuel mining. If you’re concerned about mining on indigenous land, about local impacts or labour conditions, I give you the biggest mining operations ever undertaken: for oil, gas, and coal, and the hungry machines that must constantly consume them. Extracting material that will be burned up creates the incessant cycle of consumption on which the fossil fuel industry has grown fabulously rich. It creates climate chaos as well as destruction and contamination at every stage of the process. Globally, burning fossil fuels kills almost 9 million people annually, a death toll larger than any recent war. But that death toll is largely invisible for lack of compelling stories about it. All mining needs to be done with respect for the land and people in the vicinity, but the impact of mining for renewables needs to be weighed against the far more devastating impact of mining for and burning fossil fuel. The race is on to find battery materials that are more commonly available and less impactful than lithium and cobalt, and some of the results look promising. Last summer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced an aluminium-sulphur battery is in the works, while a US company is developing one that stores electricity using iron – the so-called “iron-air” battery. Efforts to extract battery materials from longterm coal waste in West Virginia are among the many others under way. And the Inflation Reduction Act includes funding to research better battery materials and domestic US sources. Other stories of premature defeat are all too common. In the 400,000-strong 2014 climate march in New York City, one section marched behind a huge banner declaring “WE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS” – but many people still believe we do not. We have the solutions we need in solar and wind; we just need to build them out and make the transition, fast. Looking to wildly ineffectual carbon sequestration and other undeveloped technologies as a relevant solution is like ignoring the lifeboats at hand in the hope that fancy new ones are coming when the ship is sinking and speed is of the essence. One story I frequently encounter frames the possibilities in absolutes: if we can’t win everything, then we lose everything. There are so many doom-soaked stories out there – about how civilisation, humanity, even life itself, are scheduled to die out. This apocalyptic thinking is due to another narrative failure: the inability to imagine a world different than the one we currently inhabit. People without much sense of history imagine the world as static. They assume that if the present order is failing, the system is collapsing, and there is no alternative. A historical imagination equips you to understand that change is ceaseless. You only have to look to the past to see such a world, dramatically different half a century ago, stunningly so a century ago. The UK, for example, ran almost entirely on coal power until the 1960s, and if you had said then that it would have to quit coal, many would have imagined this meant an utter collapse of the energy system, not its transformation. Even in 2008, the organisation Carbon Brief noted, “four-fifths of the UK’s electricity came from fossil fuels. Since then, the UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy. Coal-fired power has virtually disappeared and even gas use is down by a quarter. Instead, the country now gets more than half of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear.” Scotland already generates nearly all the electricity it needs from renewables. While I often hear people casually assert that our world is doomed, no reputable scientist makes such claims. Most are deeply worried, but far from hopeless. There are already profound losses, but our action or inaction determine how much more loss will occur, and whose it will be, and some repair is possible. Efforts sufficient to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lower temperatures and reverse some aspects of climate breakdown. Even the journalist David Wallace-Wells, who rose to fame with a deeply pessimistic book about climate a few years ago, has shifted his view. He currently describes a future somewhere between the best and worst case scenarios, a future “with the most terrifying predictions made improbable by decarbonisation and the most hopeful ones practically foreclosed by tragic delay. The window of possible climate futures is narrowing, and as a result, we are getting a clearer sense of what’s to come: a new world, full of disruption … yet mercifully short of true climate apocalypse.” A climate story we urgently need is one that exposes who is actually responsible for climate chaos. It’s been popular to say that we are all responsible, but Oxfam reports that over the past 25 years, the carbon impact of the top 1% of the wealthiest human beings was twice that of the bottom 50%, so responsibility for the impact and the capacity to make change is currently distributed very unevenly. By saying “we are all responsible”, we avoid the fact that the global majority of us don’t need to change much, but a minority needs to change a lot. This is also a reminder that the idea that we need to renounce our luxuries and live more simply doesn’t really apply to the majority of human beings outside what we could perhaps call the overdeveloped world. What is true of Beverly Hills is not true of the majority from Bangladesh to Bolivia. When it comes to who’s harming the climate, it’s also been popular to focus on individual contributions. The fossil fuel industry likes the narrative of personal responsibility as a way to keep us scrutinising ourselves and one another, rather than them. They’ve promoted the concept of climate footprints as a way to keep the focus on us and not them, and it’s worked. Usually if I ask people what they’re doing about the climate emergency, most will talk about what they’re not consuming or doing – but these will never add up to the speed and scale of change needed to change the system. One of the goals of system change is to supersede individual virtue. Just as you no longer have to opt in to buying a car with seatbelts or ask for the no-smoking section on the train or restaurant, at some point in the near future you won’t have to opt into travelling in an electric car or bus, or living or working in all-electric buildings. Electrification will have happened because of the collective action that takes shape as policy and regulation. Last year, the veteran environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a brilliant analysis pointing out that if you have money in one of the banks funding fossil fuels – especially, in the US, Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, and Bank of America – your retirement funds or savings account may have a much larger climate footprint than you do. The impact of your diet and how you get to work may pale in comparison to the impact of your money in the bank. The vegan on the bicycle may still be contributing to climate chaos if her life savings are in a bank lending her money to the fossil fuel industry. Individual impact, leaving the ultra-wealthy aside, matters mostly in the aggregate. And in aggregate we can change that. On 21 March, McKibben, via his new climate group Third Act (on whose advisory board I sit), and dozens of other climate groups will be organising actions by people with money in, or credit cards from, the key US banks, to try to force those institutions to stop funding fossil fuels. Our greatest power lies in our roles as citizens, not consumers, when we can band together to collectively change how our world works. Various campaigns around the world have focused on fossil finance, with significant successes behind them, and much more to achieve ahead. The climate movement has become far more sophisticated and precise in its targets in recent years. It’s doing a brilliant job; it just needs enough people and resources behind it to be more powerful than the status quo. Last year, I took three activists who were formerly part of the Sunrise Movement, a youth group campaigning to address climate breakdown, to see the 1991 film Terminator 2 at a cinema. The film was as great as I remembered, not least because the lead character, Linda Hamilton playing a ferocious young mother, chooses as her motto “no fate but what we make”. In that movie, the future has come back to meddle with the present through the sci-fi technologies of time travel and robot-warrior terminators. We see how actions in the present shape the future through tremendous battles over what that future will be. This is, of course, just as true in real life. We don’t get terminators and other time-travellers to tell us what the consequences of our actions are, but they still have consequences. You ban the insecticide DDT, and a lot of bird species stop dying out. You ban chlorofluorocarbons, and the hole in the ozone layer stops growing. In another way, Terminator 2 is less useful as a lens for thinking about the climate crisis. It’s part of the conventions of storytelling in film – and comics, fiction, graphic novels and too many news narratives – that tells us that the world can only be saved by exceptional individuals, often loners, whose gifts are often the capacity to inflict and endure extreme violence. Linda Hamilton and co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot, clobber, crush, outrun and outfight everything thrown at them, and that’s their celebrated skillset, along with a bit of dry humour. Humour aside, this has little to do with how the world really gets changed most of the time. The skills of real-world superheroes are solidarity, strategy, patience, persistence, vision and the ability to inspire hope in others. The rescuers we need are mostly not individuals, they are collectives – movements, coalitions, campaigns, civil society. Within those groups there may be someone with an exceptional gift for motivating others, but even the world’s greatest conductor needs an orchestra. One person cannot do much; a movement can topple a regime. We are sadly lacking stories in which collective actions or the patient determination of organisers is what changes the world. Another thing we get from our films and fictions is the expectation of a single solution and a clear resolution to our problems: a sudden victory, a celebration, and the trouble is over. The climate crisis does not fit easily into this format. Ceasing to extract and burn fossil fuel is central, but there is no single solution. Protecting carbon-sequestering peat bogs, forests and grasslands also matters; so does transforming high-impact materials such as cement; implementing better design for buildings, transport and cities, and addressing soil conservation, farming and food production and consumption. There are milestones and important goals, but the familiar Hollywood ending – crossing the finish line to wrap up the story – doesn’t describe this reality. Change often functions more like a relay race, with new protagonists picking up where the last left off. In 2019, a Berkeley city councilwoman decided to propose banning fossil-gas connections in new construction, and it was passed by the council unanimously. This small city’s commitment to all-electric new buildings could seem insignificant, but more than 50 other California municipalities picked it up, as did the city of New York. The state of New York failed to pass a similar measure, but Washington state succeeded, and the idea that new construction should not include gas has spread internationally. Such relay races have long been how human rights campaigns work: a good protest, campaign, or even piece of legislation can introduce new ideas that do their own work in the world at large. Even failed campaigns may succeed in opening the path for later change. The Green New Deal did not pass in the US Senate, but it became a template for the Biden administration’s climate legislation, and shifted the conversation about what is possible. It led the way to the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate bill the US has ever passed. Opponents of environmental action often say it is killing jobs; the Green New Deal did a lot to change that story by portraying climate action as a job creator. Recognising the reality of climate breakdown means recognising the interconnectedness of all things. That connection brings obligation: to respect nature, to build domestic regulation and international treaties that protect what’s needed, to limit the freedom of the individual in the name of the wellbeing of the collective. This is, of course, a worldview in direct contrast with free-market fundamentalism and libertarianism. Even the facts of climate science are ideologically offensive to people committed to individual freedom without accountability, let alone the demands created by treaties and regulations. Responsibility and obligation are dismal words in mainstream culture, so perhaps there will be other stories that recognise this process as reciprocity and relationship, in which we give back, in gratitude and respect for all the Earth does for us. Even short of that, we can recognise our self-interest in maintaining the system on which life depends. If news is the daily report on what’s just happened, we need a way of pulling back from individual events, to see the broad context of how it happened. If you only tell short-term stories, it all becomes kind of meaningless. Martin Luther King Jr said: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” We’ve seen it bend a lot of ways in recent years, toward and away from justice, but it takes time just to see it bend at all. You need benchmarks or memories of how things used to be even to see change of any kind, including climate change. The South Pacific climate activist and poet Julian Aguon recently declared that Indigenous peoples “have a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory, and just might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect – for the Earth and for each other”. That emphasis on collective memory suggests that a strong sense of the past allows for a strong sense of the future, that remembering difficulty and transformation equips us to face them again. One of the things that buoys me up is the long arc of change in renewable technology. Mostly what you see in the news about renewables is short-term: stories on the latest drop in price, or proliferation of solar and wind over the past year or two. If you enlarge your time frame, you see that those annual changes have amounted to an astonishing plummet in prices and rise in efficiency and global use, compounded by innovations in materials and storage. Twenty years ago we did not have constructive ways to leave the age of fossil fuel behind. Now we do. And the solutions keep getting better. In 2021, the organisation Carbon Tracker put out a report that showed current technology could produce 100 times as much electricity from solar and wind than current global demand. The report concludes: “The technical and economic barriers have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political.” At the end of the last millennium, those barriers seemed insurmountable. The change is revolutionary, but the revolution was too slow to be visible to most. The report continues: “At the current 15-20% growth rates of solar and wind, fossil fuels will be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050. The unlocking of energy reserves 100 times our current demand creates new possibilities for cheaper energy and more local jobs in a more equitable world, with far less environmental stress.” We tend to think utopias are unbelievable, but this is a sober-minded thinktank focused on climate and energy politics. The report made little impact on the general public. Because the energy revolution has been incremental, there’s been no single breakthrough moment. Yet it adds up to an encouraging, and even astonishing narrative. On the other hand, people find grim narratives all too believable, whether or not they are grounded in fact. We are still inundated by harmful, as well as untrue, stories about climate and the future. Prophecies can be self-fulfilling: if you insist that we cannot possibly win, you pit yourself against the possibility of victory and the people trying to achieve it. There’s yet another narrative that’s persisted at least since the invention of compact fluorescent lightbulbs and the Toyota Prius: that we must renounce abundance and enter an age of austerity. It’s all in the telling. To consider our age an age of abundance, you have to be counting sheer accumulated stuff and ignoring how it is distributed. That is, we live in an age of extreme wealth for some, and desperation for the many. But there’s another way to count wealth and abundance – as hope for the future, safety and public confidence, emotional wellbeing, love and friendship and strong social networks, meaningful work and purposeful lives, equality and justice and inclusion. Early on, we heard that renewables were very expensive – this was part of the austerity narrative, or an excuse for not making the transition. But improvements in design and economies of scale are among the factors making them the cheapest form of electricity almost everywhere on earth. There’s no reason to think the innovations of design and economic improvements are all behind us; I suspect they’re mostly ahead of us. Engineer and energy expert Saul Griffith recently wrote: “Most people believe a clean-energy future will require everyone to make do with less, but it actually means we can have better things.” The old story was that we couldn’t afford to do what the climate emergency required. The new one is that it would not only be ecologically devastating, but more expensive not to. Renewables are on the way to being cheaper than fossil fuel; in many places, they already are. Texas and Iowa get a huge amount of their electricity from wind because it makes economic sense, not because these red states are passionate about addressing the climate crisis. Over their lifetime, electric cars work out to be cheaper than internal combustion cars because charging and maintaining them is cheaper. And of course these two examples don’t include the indirect effects of burning fossil fuels on human health and the climate. A lot of people tend to measure climate action in terms of huge national or international news events, but the change that matters is often happening at local and regional and other levels. A university divests; a state sets a date for ending the sale of new petrol cars; a city passes a measure mandating all-electric new buildings; ground is broken on a major solar installation; a state or country sets a new record for percentage of wind power in its energy mix; a pipeline or gas terminal or drilling site gets cancelled; a carbon-sequestering forest or peat bog gets protected status; a coal plant closes. This does not erase all the bad news, about continuing breakdown of natural systems and its toll on human lives and impact on a livable future, but it does contextualise them as crises we can respond to if we choose to. So much is happening, both wonderful and terrible, and it adds up to more stories than almost anyone can take in. But the overarching frameworks in which we receive them matter, and so do the critical skills to recognise, choose, and change stories. The climate crisis is a problem with no single solution, but many, just as there is no one saviour, but many protagonists in the struggle. In 2019, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said we must embrace “cathedral thinking”, adding: “We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.” The speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler included this passage in one of her essays: “OK,” the young man challenged. “So what’s the answer?” “There isn’t one,” I told him. “No answer? You mean we’re just doomed?” He smiled as though he thought this might be a joke. “No,” I said. “I mean there’s no single answer that will solve all of our future problems. There’s no magic bullet. Instead there are thousands of answers – at least. You can be one of them if you choose to be.” This is an edited version of a speech given at Princeton University in November 2022","‘If you win the popular imagination, you change the game’: why we need new stories on climate",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/12/rebecca-solnit-climate-crisis-popular-imagination-why-we-need-new-stories

If its construction goes to plan, a €2.5 billion (£2.18 billion) undersea pipeline will convey “green hydrogen” from Spain to France from 2030. In the US, some power stations are being upgraded to allow hydrogen to be blended with fossil gas, and the Norwegian oil company Equinor is teaming up with Thermal SSE to build a 1,800 megawatt (MW) “blue hydrogen” power plant in Britain. Meanwhile, China unveiled a plan in March which includes deploying 50,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2025 and early December saw the first hydrogen-fuelled tractors and forklifts leave the assembly line at a new plant in Guangdong province. Hydrogen is produced in multiple ways. A colour spectrum is used to render it simple. “Grey” and “brown/black” hydrogen come from fossil gas (methane) and coal (brown or black coal) respectively – a process that, for every tonne of hydrogen, emits between ten and 12 tonnes of CO₂ for grey hydrogen and 18 to 20 for brown. “Blue” is the same process except the carbon dioxide is supposed to be captured and stored underground. And “green” hydrogen is conventionally defined as generated from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. But only 0.04% of hydrogen is green, and blue hydrogen is less than 1%. The rest is grey or brown, most of which is used in oil refineries and for manufacturing ammonia and methanol. It’s an enormous industry which emits more CO₂ than all of Britain and France combined. It is widely hoped that a silver lining of today’s high gas prices will be green hydrogen becoming a cost-competitive alternative to dirty fuels in boilers, shipping tankers and steelworks furnaces. Unfortunately, without electricity market reform, this opportunity is likely to be squandered. And while the buzz around the hydrogen economy intensifies, a closer look suggests the fuel is less a spearhead for a green transition and more the subject of an elaborate bait-and-switch operation by oil companies. Hydrogen’s true colours Green hydrogen is essential for decarbonisation: to replace fossil fuels in steelmaking, ammonia production for fertilisers and possibly shipping and trucking – processes which are difficult to electrify. Some green hydrogen is crosshatched with dirtier hues. So it’s not simply that in its production a lot of energy is wasted in the double transformation from electricity to gas and then fuel. But burning hydrogen also emits nitrogen oxides, air pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain. If green hydrogen production is scaled up to play a significant economic role by 2050, its freshwater demand will exceed one-quarter of today’s global annual consumption, risking water scarcity in some regions. Above all, hydrogen is meaningfully green only if the renewable energy that generates it cannot be fed into the grid to replace power from gas or coal plants. Blue hydrogen relies on a similar – but much more harmful – trick of the light. For hydrogen to be true blue, the emissions must be captured and securely stored. In theory, carbon capture and storage works but nearly all plants use the captured carbon to pump more oil and many have been shut down as failures. Only a handful store carbon indefinitely and even these consume lots of energy and capture only some of the CO₂, which can leak. Blue hydrogen’s main source is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is notorious for escaping drilling wells and pipelines. Research suggests that these issues make blue hydrogen worse for the climate than fossil gas. In the EU, as in many economies, electricity pricing is based on the principle of marginal costs, which means that the most expensive source (typically fossil gas) sets the wholesale power price. During sunny or windy spells, a glut of renewable energy generation can slash electricity prices, freeing them from the grip of natural gas prices for a few hours at a time. This is often not enough to justify investments in the electrolysers which produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen won’t gain the necessary price advantage over blue hydrogen and fossil gas until electricity markets are restructured. Meanwhile, the high price of oil and gas has turbocharged the industry’s expansion. The US government is exhorting oil and fracking firms to “drill baby drill”. Britain’s government is to award more than 100 licenses to drill for oil and gas and colossal new fossil fuel investments have been announced across the Middle East and Africa. In a few years when these new sources come onstream, and particularly if economic growth continues to slow and depress energy demand, gas and oil will become cheaper again – until the next price spike prompts new rounds of investment, and the infernal cycle continues. The owners of newly-built wells, pipelines and terminals will fight to defend those assets and stall decarbonisation. Now fossil-fuel firms are rebranding themselves as agents of “carbon management.” The aim is to prevent their assets from getting stranded by repurposing them, presenting a largely fictional substance, blue hydrogen, as a low-carbon “bridge” to an unspecified green future. Other sectors have joined the oil-led coalition. As the engineer Tom Baxter observes, gas network operators and boiler manufacturers see their survival in this ploy. Utilities are similarly keen, as hydrogen’s inefficiencies allow them to sell more power. Tackling this stalling operation requires public policy. Governments will need to regulate or tax carbon out of the market while simultaneously ramping up renewables. The approach to electricity pricing also needs to shift, to decouple the prices of electricity generated from renewables and fossil gas. The marginal pricing system hugely benefits renewable project owners, since they profit from high electricity prices and effectively zero input costs. An alternative market structure would set rewards for generators according to their average costs plus a slight surplus which could be reinvested into deploying more renewables and other green technologies, providing consumers with cheap electricity. This can only be achieved through a robustly regulated market or by nationalising energy companies and setting prices and production. These interventions would give green hydrogen a competitive advantage over blue or grey variants, one that could be furthered with other subsidies, such as tax credits on the model of the US Inflation Reduction Act. Above all, energy demand must be reduced to ease upward pressure on price. In any future energy system, hydrogen will have a role. But its expansion must be carefully designed, to prevent the promise of green hydrogen disguising the risks of its blue and grey cousins.

The company, which is part of Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, will begin consultations over 440 redundancies and said it will idle its plant at West Bromwich and convert another in Newport, Wales, into a storage facility. Jobs are also likely to be lost at its Rotherham plant after Liberty said it became “unviable” to produce cheaper steel products, “due to high energy costs and imports from countries without the same environmental standards”. The firm will now focus on steel for defence, energy and aircraft-making clients in a bid to regain profitability. Jeffrey Kabel, Chief Transformation Officer for Liberty Steel Group said: “While our action is expected to regrettably impact the roles of some of our workforce we will provide a level of guaranteed salary and placement opportunities.” He added: “We remain committed to our longer-term growth plans in the UK including our plan to grow Rotherham into a 2 million tonne green steel hub.” Cheap imports from China, where European producers say lax pollution regulations make the material cheaper to make, are squeezing margins on cheaper steel products such as the thick rebar staves used to reinforce concrete in the construction industry. But Britain is also at a disadvantage to European producers, according to UK Steel, the industry group. It estimates that German producers will pay £107 per megawatt hour of electricity in the coming financial year compared to £174 for UK steel mills. Electric furnaces are seen as the future of many UK steel mills as wind power becomes an increasing part of power supply. The steel sector employs 34,500 people directly in the UK and supports a further 43,000 in supply chains. The jobs are often in areas with few other skilled careers and they offer a salary averaging £37,629, 45pc higher than the UK national average. Alun Davies, Community steelworkers' union national officer, said: “This announcement is a body blow to Liberty Steel’s loyal UK workforce, who couldn’t have done more to get the company through an exceptionally challenging period.” Liberty Steel, the UK’s third-largest steel maker after Tata and British Steel, employs 1,900 people in the UK as well as 5,000 contractors. It said Rotherham could lose 185 jobs, while 121 were at risk in Newport, where the company makes thin plates of steel known as hot rolled coil. West Bromwich could lose 99 jobs, and 35 could be lost in Tredegar in South Wales. Both sites make steel tubes. Liberty was hit by the collapse of Greensill Capital from which it borrowed $5bn (£4.1bn). Mr Gupta’s businesses had borrowed from ventures founded by Australian entrepreneur Lex Greensill, which loaned money to companies short term. It collapsed after one of its insurers refused to renew cover. In November, Liberty reached an understanding with creditors to Lex Greensill’s former lending empire including Swiss bank Credit Suisse, in what it called a major step in refinancing the troubled businesses.",Liberty Steel to make over 400 staff redundant as energy costs hammer industry,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/12/liberty-steel-make-400-staff-redundant-energy-costs-hammer-industry/

Thursday saw several developments in Britain’s many industrial disputes as it emerged the ambulance union will meet next week to consider six more strike days. Staff at more than 150 universities across the country are demanding that employers push up their offer of a 3 per cent pay rise after more than a decade of below-inflation increases, the union said. “The clock is now ticking for the sector to produce a deal or be hit with widespread disruption throughout spring,” UCU general secretary Jo Grady said. Meanwhile, around 100,000 civil servants have also decided to go ahead with a walkout next month after failed talks with the government were dismissed as a “total farce”. Doctors’ unions told health secretary Steve Barclay that he must address the “workforce crisis” at a meeting on Thursday, during which there was no movement on pay demands, while a ballot of a teacher’s union failed to meet the threshold for strike action. Talks aimed at resolving the long-running rail dispute were also set to continue following meetings between unions and employers on Thursday. Further ambulance strikes loom as figures showed emergency response times had fallen to their worst on record, with more than one in 10 people left waiting for paramedics for more than three-and-a-half hours after calling, including with serious illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of damaging the NHS. Speaking in Belfast, he said: “The most important thing is that these strikes are ended. They will only be ended if the government gets in the room and negotiates and so instead of grandstanding, they need to govern.” Mr Barclay was given a “very clear message” that it would not be enough to focus on next year’s NHS settlement with doctors without a shift on current wages, union leaders said. Representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA), hospital doctors’ union the HCSA, and the British Dental Association (BDA) all met Mr Barclay on Thursday at what was described by both sides as a “constructive” meeting. A strike by 100,000 civil servants will go ahead next month after talks with the government aimed at resolving a bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions broke down. Cabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin met with union leaders to discuss growing industrial unrest after weeks of stoppages across the country, including by Border Force staff over Christmas.

Nasuwt general secretary Patrick Roach said the union remains “in formal disputes with ministers and employers and will be continuing to take forward our campaigning for a Better Deal for Teachers. He said: “The readiness of our members to support industrial action demonstrates the anger of the profession and the need for governments in England and Wales to engage in meaningful negotiations to address the deep concerns of our members. “Our campaign to fight for the real-terms pay awards that teachers and headteachers deserve continues.” Leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) met separately with the Rail Delivery Group on Thursday. Both sides said detailed discussions were held and they were working towards a revised offer. Strikes have been held since last summer in the row over pay, jobs and conditions, causing huge disruption to services. No more strikes have been called. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said: “We have been in detailed discussions with the Rail Delivery Group for the train operating companies. We are working jointly towards a revised offer for their section of the dispute. “We’ve agreed that over the next couple of days we’ll continue to work on that through discussions, and we’ll see what comes of it.” Additional reporting by Press Association.",University staff to walk out for 18 days as ambulance workers consider further strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/strikes-ambulance-trains-nhs-teachers-b2261200.html

The James Hutton Institute has signed construction contracts with McLaughlin & Harvey worth £28.7m for the next stage of the ongoing redevelopment of its Invergowrie estate. This new contract comprises the construction of a combined Advanced Plant Growth Centre (APGC) and international barley hub (IBH). The new building – with the APGC downstairs and the IBH above – will be full of the latest state-of-the-art scientific equipment. This will include computing facilities, imaging technology, sensor-based systems, robotics and controlled environmental cabinets for growing plants. The project, funded by £62m from the Tay Cities Deal, is part of a masterplan to create two institute-led innovation centres at Invergowrie. It will help establish Scotland as a leader in global food security and crop resilience. Enabling works are ongoing on-site. A number of older buildings are being demolished to make way for the new facility. It will be built in the heart of the Invergowrie Campus and is due to be completed in early 2024. A ‘significant milestone’ for £62m project James Hutton Institute chief executive Colin Campbell hailed a “significant milestone” for the project. He added: “It aims to futureproof the barley sector across Scotland and the UK. “This new facility will serve as the key research hub. “It is set to bring around £60 million benefit and over 1,200 jobs to Scotland over the next 10 years.” UK Government Minister for Scotland Malcolm Offord said the facility will support “the future prosperity of our farming industry”. He also welcomed the creation of jobs in the region. Mr Offord said: “The UK Government is investing £45m at the James Hutton Institute through the Tay Cities Deal. “These new facilities will undertake vital research that will support food security and the future prosperity of our farming industry, while also creating new jobs for the region. McLaughlin & Harvey’s operations director Robbie Clark said the firm was delighted to be working on the project. He said: “Having recently completed the state-of-the-art Barley Field Centre facilities, our highly experienced project team will now move seamlessly on to the delivery of the new Advanced Plant Growth Centre and International Barley Hub.” Newly filed accounts for its commercial arm, James Hutton Limited, show it made pre-tax profits of over £600,000 for the year to March 2022.

At first, there is often outrage that the usual supremacy of bosses over workers has been suspended. Preserving such hierarchies is one of Conservatism’s main aims. But then there is sometimes a sense of opportunity: a belief that the strikers and their supporters may fall into a familiar trap, set by decades of anti-union legislation and press propaganda. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have believed that strikes can be used to make Tory governments look tough, and to discredit Labour and the wider left. The succession of aggressive, deliberately provocative anti-strike measures announced over the last six months by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak all reflect an assumption that taking on the unions is one of the few remaining strategies that might get the Conservatives re-elected. Yet there is also a third, almost forgotten Tory approach to strikes. Before the Thatcher government, her predecessor as Conservative premier, Edward Heath, faced with strikes that, like today’s, were highly disruptive and yet had considerable public support, was sometimes forced to negotiate and make concessions. As the leader of an unpopular government presiding over a fragile economy that the strikes were weakening further, Heath reluctantly accepted that the unions could not all be beaten. The briefly more constructive tone of some of this week’s talks between ministers and union leaders could be a sign that Sunak, too, will ultimately have to concede at least partial victories to some of the strikers. Like Heath, he is not a dominant or charismatic enough prime minister to change the national conversation about strikes and unions, as Thatcher did. His administration could finally mark the beginning of the end for the version of union-bashing Conservatism she invented, which seems increasingly irrelevant to today’s world of poverty wages and modest union memberships. Alternatively, the industrial relations of Sunak’s premiership could be much messier. Like the party he leads – for now, at least – the prime minister’s political thinking is an unstable, quite possibly unsustainable mix, including a desire to be pragmatic and “reasonable”, a dogmatic belief in markets as the best distributors of economic rewards, and an elite remoteness from ordinary working lives. His government’s attitude to the strikes is to be more conciliatory and more confrontational at the same time. Some strikers may be offered one-off bonuses and better pay rises; others, if they refuse to provide so-far-undefined “minimum service” in sectors from health to education may in future be sacked – despite being participants in walkouts that were democratically agreed and wholly legal when launched. For days now, the government has presented this minimum service legislation as an even-handed measure, to “restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption”. But claiming that a better “balance” between trade unionists and the public is required – rather than acknowledging that in millions of cases trade unionists and the public are the same people – has been a partisan Tory ploy for decades. British life has been tilted against unions since the 80s. And the Tories have never shown any interest in balancing the relationship between the public and other, more powerful and disruptive, but right-leaning, economic protagonists, such as the City of London. The disingenuous and vaguely worded minimum service bill also echoes recent draconian legislation aimed partly at road-blocking climate activists, “to balance the rights of protesters against the rights of others to go about their daily business”. Sunak may present himself as a centre-right technocrat, but partly out of panic at the mounting opposition to his government and Conservatism in general, he is increasingly ruling as an authoritarian. The government insists it supports the right to strike. The business secretary, Grant Shapps – often selected to try to make extreme policies sound moderate – said on the BBC’s Today programme earlier this week that the “ideal outcome” of the bill would be for the government “to have the power” to set minimum service levels “and never have to use it”, because unions would voluntarily set their own. But this scenario is less reassuring than it was meant to sound. If strikes in much of the economy are required to come with their own strike-breaking operations, of a size dictated directly or indirectly by the government, something fundamental to workplace politics has been altered. It’s possible that the bill may never become law, since it seems to contravene protections for unions in the European convention on human rights. And even if the legislation survives challenges in the courts, the Commons and the Lords, and on the streets (the TUC has announced a “national right to strike day” on 1 February) it may be hard to implement. Minimum service levels will have to be defined for a vast range of different workplaces, and then enforced without sacking too many essential staff or creating too many union martyrs. Yet to focus on such difficulties, enormous though they are, is to miss part of the point of this latest attack on strikers. Like many Tory policies since and including Brexit, the bill is meant to be symbolic and divisive as much as practical, to create bogeymen and energise Tory supporters. If inflation falls as expected between now and the election, and the strikers’ pay claims therefore seem less justified to many voters, then a continuing anti-union culture war might be timely. Without a Thatcher, fresh rightwing ideas or much remaining administrative energy, today’s Tories probably can’t run a reforming government that really hurts the left – but they can pretend. The problem with this impersonation of radicalism, though, is that it requires enough voters to be taken in. And Johnson’s drifting premiership, Truss’s shambolic tenure and now Sunak’s tone-deaf performance in 10 Downing Street have removed the Conservatives’ credibility as a governing party. Even the union-hating press hasn’t given the minimum service bill as much coverage as you might expect, which suggests uncertainty about its significance. Half a century ago, as well as negotiating with unions, Heath’s government also tried to weaken them through legislation. The 1970 industrial relations bill eventually became law despite huge protests. But it was widely flouted, and he lost the next election. If you’re a struggling Tory prime minister, victories on paper over the workers probably won’t save you.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded an increase of 0.1% as the services sector remained in growth despite the soaring cost of living. Experts at the ONS said the slight rise was supported by the technology sector and a strong showing by pubs and bars amid a boost from the winter World Cup in Qatar. It nevertheless represented a slowdown in growth after GDP increased by 0.5% in October. Analysts had predicted the economy would shrink by 0.3% for November. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy grew a little in November, with increases in telecommunications and computer programming helping to push the economy forward. “Pubs and bars also did well as people went out to watch World Cup games. “This was partially offset by further falls in some manufacturing industries, including the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, as well as falls in transport and postal, partially due to the impact of strikes. “Over the last three months, however, the economy still shrank – mainly due to the impact of the extra bank holiday for the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in September.” Consumer-facing industries were the biggest growth driver of the month, witnessing a 0.4% increase amid a lift from higher food and drink sales during the World Cup. The service sector also grew by 0.2% as more punters visited pubs and other venues, although this still reflected a slowdown from a 0.7% rise a month earlier. In November, the construction sector saw growth fall away as it stayed flat for the month following a 0.4% rise in October. Elsewhere, manufacturing was the main cause of a 0.2% decline in the production sector for the period. The ONS added that GDP still contracted by 0.3% over the three months to November despite the latest growth. The economy also declined by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2022 and would therefore enter a technical recession if a further fall is recorded for the final quarter of the year. Economists have suggested that the latest data makes it less clear whether the UK will have entered a recession at the end of last year. Kitty Usher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “This is stronger activity than was expected for November and so will further contribute to the improvement in market sentiment we have seen in the last few weeks. “Given we know the economy also grew in October – albeit driven by a rebound from the period of state mourning – it is no longer certain that the economy will meet the technical definition of a recession when the final data for 2022 is in.” It comes as inflation started to cool down in November, dropping to 10.7% from a 41-year-high of 11.1% a month earlier, and it is expected to drop further through 2023. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said: “We have a clear plan to halve inflation this year – an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world. “To support families through this tough patch, we will provide an average of £3,500 support for every household over this year and next – but the most important help we can give is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year so we get the economy growing again.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow Chancellor, said: “Today’s results are just another page in the book of failure that is the Tory record on growth. “The news of further economic pain will be deeply concerning to families already struggling with the soaring cost of living.”",UK economy unexpectedly grows in November,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/gdp-jeremy-hunt-rachel-reeves-institute-of-directors-b2261459.html

The UK's gross domestic product (GDP) - a key economic measure of services, construction and manufacturing output - rose by 0.1%. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said pubs and restaurants contributed to growth as people went out to watch World Cup games. However, in the three months to November, the economy shrank by 0.3%. The UK economy had been widely expected to contract in November. But the services sector, which includes a wide-range of industries from hospitality to shopping, was the biggest driver of growth that month. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, told the BBC: ""Business involved in telecoms and computer programmers did okay in November. ""Also interestingly employment agencies did reasonably well and perhaps that reflects those businesses seeking support to fill the vacancies they have which we know from our labour market figures has been an issue in certain sectors."" The ONS also said that there was ""anecdotal evidence"" to suggest that the FIFA World Cup had benefited some businesses such as pubs and restaurants as well as sales of wine and demand for pizza delivery.

They want senior managers at tech firms to face two years in jail if they breach new duties over acceptable content, which includes posts promoting self-harm, depicting sexual violence or facilitating suicide. Labour is expected to support the amendment. Currently the proposed laws would only make bosses criminally liable for failing to give information to media regulator Ofcom and firms would face higher fines. Culture secretary Michelle Donelan has said she is “not ruling out” changes to legislation in the face of the major backbench rebellion. Dame Andrea said in its current form the bill is just asking companies “nicely” to protect children online. She told BBC Radio 4: “There should be this backstop that if you, as a senior tech director, or manager, knowingly allow harm to be caused that results in suicide, pornography, child abuse online and so on. “If you let that happen, there should be a backstop that you can be criminally prosecuted.” Dame Andrea added that in many other businesses, including in the financial and construction sectors, directors will face prosecution if their practices cause significant harm to someone.

The winning bids were revealed in a joint announcement by the UK and Scottish governments. The special economic zones north of the border are being created under a scheme agreed by the two governments. The successful applicants will be able to offer tax incentives and lower tariffs in the zones. A total of five bids for green freeport status were submitted, with North East Scotland, Orkney and Clyde missing out. Each had to set out how they would regenerate their area, create high-quality jobs and support transition to a net-zero economy. The Forth Green Freeport bid was led by Forth Ports, which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland. In submitting its bid, Forth Ports said it had the potential to create up to 50,000 new, high-quality jobs in renewable energy, manufacturing, sustainable fuels and construction. Its activities will focus on renewables, advanced manufacturing, alternative fuels, carbon capture utilisation and storage, shipbuilding, logistics and the creative industries. The Opportunity Cromarty Firth consortium - backed by Port of Cromarty Firth, Global Energy Group, Highland Resources and Port of Inverness - said it could create 25,000 jobs. The Inverness and Cromarty Firth bid aims to build a ""world-beating"" floating offshore wind manufacturing sector, with sites in the Cromarty Firth, Invergordon, Nigg and Inverness. Also called free trade zones, freeports are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in a zone receive tax waivers or tax breaks on National Insurance contributions, Land and Buildings Transactions Tax, business rates and capital allowances. The Scottish ""green freeport"" model includes commitments to meeting net zero targets and supporting fair work practices. The UK government has committed funding of £52m to the project and bidders had to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. Scotland's deputy first minister, John Swinney, described the creation of green freeports as a ""milestone achievement"". He said: ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport and Forth Green Freeport will support businesses to create high-quality, well-paid new jobs, promote growth and regeneration, and make a significant contribution to achieving our net zero ambitions. ""The successful applicants showed a strong determination to embed fair work practices, including payment of the Real Living Wage, and to enshrine net zero initiatives in their work. ""We look forward to working closely with them to ensure they deliver maximum positive impact and become operational as soon as possible."" The UK government's Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the green freeports would ""undoubtedly be transformative for future generations"". He added: ""Scotland has areas of outstanding opportunity but there are also places that can benefit from more investment to truly level up communities that have been overlooked. ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Firth of Forth are fantastic areas for these new green freeports to set up, ensuring the benefits are felt right across Scotland. ""This will help to create exciting new jobs, boost business and encourage investment in the local areas and beyond."" Scottish Renewables said it was pleased that the freeports would have green energy as a focus. Its head of energy transition and supply chain, Emma Harrick, said they would ""help Scotland compete on the international stage as offshore wind develops to become the mainstay of electricity generation in the UK"". The Scottish and UK governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border, after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later said they would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. The SNP's partners in government - the Scottish Greens - do not support the freeports, arguing they are likely to result in ""greenwashing"" rather than genuine action on sustainability. Greens MSP Ross Greer described freeports as a ""Thatcherite gimmick"" and voiced concern about potential abuse by criminals. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""We've consistently across the world seen freeports attract a lot of criminal activity, particularly money laundering and smuggling, because of the customs arrangements that are in place for them, because they are about deregulation, they are about making it 'easier', particularly for international trade."" Paul Swinney, director of policy research for think tank Centre for Cities, said it remained to be seen how much impact the new freeports would have. He said: ""With freeports, the government has dressed it up as saying we are going to make them into centres of innovation and hotbeds of new ideas. ""But the reality is that the tools that are that on offer make these schemes very attractive to low-skilled businesses rather than high-skilled businesses.""",Cromarty Firth and Forth to host first green freeports,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64248082?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

The Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) bid is a collaboration of more than a dozen organisations representing industry, academia and the public sector around the Easter Ross and Inverness area. The aim is to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity in manufacturing, and from local and inward investment, innovation, skills development and employment. READ MORE: Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport officially confirmed by Scottish and UK Governments The OCF area has been highlighted as the main location for the UK to benefit from floating wind manufacturing. Reacting to the news, HIE’s chief executive Stuart Black, said: “We congratulate Opportunity Cromarty Firth (OCF) on their successful bid. This is fantastic news. “Our collective belief in the region and the key ports’ capacity and capability to play an essential role in offshore wind and green hydrogen delivery has been confirmed by the dedication, commitment and resolve shown by the bid partners. ""This paves the way for even greater industry collaboration. The consortium’s physical assets, natural resources, experienced supply chain, and can-do people have proven to be a winning combination that can lead to future success. “The Highlands and Islands will play a critical role in meeting the challenging net zero targets at both Scotland and UK levels. Green freeport status for the Cromarty Firth will be a huge asset, driving collaboration between industry, academia and the public sector to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity, investment, innovation and skills development. “It will attract large-scale manufacturing and create thousands of green jobs that complement the skills of the local workforce and accelerate Scotland’s and the UK’s progress to achieving net zero targets. “A green freeport will also build on recent significant investments made in ports and harbours across the region and the historic and ongoing strengths here in energy, engineering and life sciences. “It will be a key enabler for supply chains of the future, rapidly accelerating domestic manufacturing capacity in an area with a long-standing industrial heritage. “We very much look forward to our region working in partnership with OCF, as we seek to secure maximum socio-economic impact, not just around the Cromarty Firth and Inverness but throughout many parts of the Highlands and Islands.” Sheelagh Cooley, real estate partner in the Edinburgh office of law firm Shoosmiths, also welcomed the successful bid. She said: “The confirmation of two green freeports in Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Forth represents an opportunity to drive forward new development, regeneration and economic growth in Scotland. “The potential impact of these projects, however, must not be limited to the immediate vicinity of the green freeports. Rather, true success hinges on the ability to also revitalise surrounding towns and cities, many of which are economically deprived. “In Inverness and Cromarty Firth, the introduction of a green freeport is said to have the potential to unlock £2.5bn of new private sector investment – creating up to 25,000 jobs. This is alongside developing wind power technology, with its port facilities already supporting offshore wind projects. “While the introduction of green freeports is governed by UK legislation, the model’s legislative structure is subject to devolved and reserved powers. The sites are intended to be secure custom zones where business can be carried out inside a land border, but where different custom and tax rules apply - offering various regulatory and financial incentives. “From a planning perspective, the green freeports are likely to operate under extended permitted development rights. Combined with a streamlining of the consenting process for development, this type of relaxed planning regime could, in theory, allow schemes – residential, commercial and infrastructure - to be brought forward at speed and avoiding certain barriers. “Unlike the UK government’s freeport model, and investment zone proposals, Scottish green freeports are subject to additional requirements, including on carbon neutrality and paying the real Living Wage. “The Forth green freeport could act as a catalyst for the manufacture of offshore wind turbines, shipbuilding and energy systems. It encompasses several ports, industrial and logistics sites, as well as Edinburgh Airport, with the consortium behind the bid outlining that it could lead to a boom in job creation and economic growth that is rooted in renewable energy and decarbonisation. “The successful bidders will now work with the Scottish and UK Government to determine a governance structure for each site. A process that must balance deregulation and economic growth with protecting the environment and assisting the transition to net zero. “Subject to compliance with the regulatory controls, green freeports should provide a welcome opportunity for growth in the Scottish economy, especially in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.” Dr Liz Cameron CBE, Chief Executive, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, also welcomed the award. She said: “It is great news for Scottish business that the UK and Scottish Governments have finally confirmed the sites of the two winning bids. It’s important now that both governments act swiftly to ensure that the successful sites are operational at the earliest opportunity, we are all competing to attract investment and trade. “Whilst it will be very disappointing for those areas who were not successful, we would urge both governments to now consider, in partnership with the business community, other incentives and initiatives which could be developed from the innovation demonstrated by the other bidders.” Professor Chris O’Neil, principal and chief executive of UHI Inverness, said: “The awarding of Green Freeport status to Inverness and Cromarty Firth will have a transformative impact on the economic fortunes of the community we serve. ""We are poised, together with our UHI partners, to meet the subsequent skills and knowledge demand. “We have the expertise in engineering, research, technology, design and construction to provide a highly-skilled and aspirational workforce, including trainees, apprentices, graduates and researchers. “As well as being well-placed to meet the associated need for talent, we also have the established industry links and capacity for knowledge exchange to make valuable collaborative contributions to the creation of a global green hub. “Our talented and committed students have proved their resilience by studying while coping with the consequences of a pandemic and then a cost-of-living crisis, and this announcement is significant in that it represents an improved future and enhanced opportunities for many of them. “Current and upcoming students will complete their learning journey knowing there is the potential for attractive employment on our doorstep in an expanding industry.

Josh Self,87322068,https://www.politics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PA-68183790.jpg,en,2023-01-13 16:13:37,-0.024,GB,"Rishi Sunak is a hyper-aware, even self-conscious prime minister. Since taking post in October, he has worked assiduously to present a “slick” image to the media, undertaken multiple U-turns to halt backbench rebellions and tried at every turn to position himself positively against Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer. The tricky technocrat in No 10 is obsessed with good press. It is an approach that bares stark contrast to the days of Liz Truss, who showed little concern for how her policies might be received amid her deeply misguided ideological crusade. Unlike his predecessor, therefore, you can take for granted that when Sunak announces a new policy, there will be a hefty amount of calculated politicking involved. In this way, November’s Autumn Statement was strategically orientated to exploit traditional Conservative strengths and traditional Labour weaknesses. Sir Keir, ever-keen to present Labour as a responsible party after the Cobrynite experiment, was challenged to disagree with Sunak’s proposals. In the end, Labour’s inability to sign up wholeheartedly to the new fiscal orthodoxy exposed, in chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s analysis, a deficit of common sense in Labour ranks. When it comes to the government’s new anti-strike bill, the political thinking is essentially the same. Setting a trap… The new anti-strike legislation was introduced to the House on Tuesday by business secretary Grant Shapps. Citing risks posed to NHS patients, Shapps outlined that the new bill would require public sector services to run minimum levels of provision on strike days — essentially forcing a certain proportion of an industry to work or face the sack. The move harks back to a “golden age” of Conservative power over industrial relations. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have viewed strikes as a way to make their party look tough and discredit the Labour Party alongside the wider left. To be sure, we have already seen Starmer encounter some political difficulty in this latest wave of industrial action. In the summer, he chose to sack one-time frontbencher Sam Tarry for standing alongside picketing workers. For the Labour leader — intent on distancing his party from the unions — Tarry had crossed a very literal red line. But even if Starmer wants to downplay the connection, there is no escaping the fact that the Labour party is associated politically and financially with the trade union movement. With the new anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak hopes to implicate Labour in an upsurge of union militancy, thus slowing Starmer’s inexorable march towards Downing Street. It was telling that ministers chose to announce the new strike legislation within hours of the Labour leader’s “New year, New Vision” speech last week. Shapps’ pledge stole Starmer’s limelight and Labour’s newly announced “take back control bill” secured a grand total of zero newspaper front pages the following day. The politics of the new legislation also dominated Starmer’s post-speech press conference. Under a barrage of questioning, the Labour leader confirmed that his party will vote against the plans and repeal the Act if he takes power at the next election. It was all going to plan for Sunak. He had goaded Starmer out of hiding and forced the Labour leader to share an ideological platform with that favourite Conservative bogeyman: the so-called union “baron”. The PMQs’ attack lines wrote themselves. However, few would deny that the prime minister is playing a high-stakes political game with his new anti-strike bill. Although Starmer’s reaction could be accounted for, the government risks running into a hostile public backlash. Now a week on from when the legislation was announced, and many view the new proposals as needlessly and deliberately obstructive. Risk 1: The government is viewed as needlessly obstructive Although Conservative MPs imagine Mick Lynch as the new Arthur Scargill, the infamous union “baron” who led opposition to Margaret Thatcher, the general public is not so convinced. Instead, the political posturing around the new anti-strike bill may be viewed as deepening the industrial relations crisis and prolonging our winter of discontent. Furthermore, the new bills’ parliamentary progress is set to be slow, with a difficult House of Lords stage beckoning. And when/if the bill does eventually pass, its key provisions will unquestionably be tested in the courts before they can take effect, just as is the case with deportations to Rwanda. So with the proposed legislation unlikely to do anything to solve urgent disputes, the public may well wonder want the point is at all — if not to be deliberately coercive and punitive. Risk 2: Labour exploits support for striking nurses Another risk for Sunak is that by focussing on risks posed to NHS patients during the strikes, he ventures onto territory where the Labour Party is traditionally at its strongest. It is telling that Starmer has focused his attacks on the part of the bill which would allow employers to sack workers who defy a “work notice” by striking. At PMQs on Wednesday, Starmer accused the government of going from “clapping the nurses to sacking the nurses”. On Thursday came a new widely-shared graphic by order of Labour Party HQ, which accused Sunak of planning to give striking nurses “the finger”, Alan Sugar-style. This attack line works because it is not very far from the truth. As a result of the proposed law, individual nurses could be prosecuted and even jailed. These are the same people Sunak was pictured clapping for, as chancellor, throughout the pandemic. Risk 3: Sunak is viewed as a rigid, uncompromising ideologue Sunak’s desire to be seen as pragmatic and “reasonable” may be fundamentally undermined by the passage of this bill. In pursuing the new legislation, Sunak has abandoned his “managerialism” and political prudence, territory where the risk-averse Starmer is comfortable, in order to set up a battle over principles, territory where Starmer is not. Honing in on fundamental Labour-Conservative differences in a bid to exploiting the Labour leader’s risk-averse nature, Sunak hence risks exposing the worst aspects of Conservative ideology. While the prime minister may point to a more conciliatory tone in negotiations, there is no hiding that the new law is an act of explicitly Thatcherite homage. It is as provocative and divisive as much as practically possible, drawing on Conservatism’s collective memory of disputes in the 1980s. However, you cannot help but think that in picking a fight with NHS nurses, Sunak has chosen the wrong moment to abandon his “problem-solving” priorities and get dug in with Conservative dogma. One recent YouGov poll found that 64% of the public support the striking nurses. Rather than introducing anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak’s political future may be better served by getting around the negotiating table and constructively ending the industrial dispute once and for all. So with imagery of nurses in handcuffs circling — and with ordinary Britons desperate for some degree of normalcy to return, Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes looks destined to fail.",Week-in-Review: Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes is destined to fail,https://www.politics.co.uk/week-in-review/2023/01/13/week-in-review-sunaks-attempt-to-trap-starmer-on-strikes-is-destined-to-fail/

As energy experts focused on how data can be used in the transition to a low-carbon economy, we have closely followed how this volatility has played out in Britain. Full data for the year 2022 is now available and here are a few things we have noticed. Britain (we talk about Britain and not the UK, as Northern Ireland is part of an integrated Irish electricity grid) saw a 4% drop in electricity demand from 2021 – that’s the third largest year-on-year reduction after 2008 (caused by the shock of the global financial crash) and pandemic-affected 2020. It takes Britain’s overall electricity demand back to values last seen in the 1980s, an 18% reduction from its peak in 2005. This time two years ago, we stated that COVID lockdowns meant electricity demand would never be so low again. We got it wrong. In fact, 2022 was the lowest year by some margin (2% lower than 2020). We believe the main factors for this drop were the significant increase in prices, the wider media attention on this, and the wider cost of living crisis. From importer to exporter The earliest undersea high-voltage direct current cable (known as an interconnector) from Britain to another country’s power grid was laid in 1961 across the Strait of Dover to France. In the years since, another seven have been constructed: two to Ireland, one to Belgium, one to the Netherlands, one to Norway and a further two to France. More interconnectors are under construction or proposed, including a connection with Denmark due to go live at the end of 2023. Since 1978, Britain has always used these cables to import more electricity than it exported over a given year. Over the past decade, an average of 5% of the country’s electricity has been imported, helping to reduce the amount it needed to generate itself. However, net imports swung to net exports in 2022 for the first time in 44 years. Looking at the individual interconnectors, it was the link to France that caused this significant change. In 2021, there were 14 terawatt-hours (TWh) of net imports from France whereas in 2022, there were 10 TWh to France. This is an enormous swing of 24 TWh from a single point of connection, and represents the largest annual change in a single electricity source since the shift from coal to gas in 2015/16. To put 24 TWh in context, this is broadly similar to the amount of electricity Scotland uses each year, or the annual output from Britain’s onshore wind generation. So what happened? Over the past year, French nuclear power stations had many maintenance problems which led to significant reductions in their output. In August, 57% of the country’s generation capacity was not being used. Despite a modest recovery, as of January 2023, 15 of its 56 reactors were closed for repairs. All this meant nuclear-reliant France had to import electricity from neighbouring countries. This led to more electricity being generated in Britain than would otherwise have been the case, to satisfy the additional demand from France. So while Britain’s renewable generation was at a record level, its fossil fuel generation was also higher than in the previous year. Without the problems in France, 2022 could have been the first year that Britain’s wind, solar and hydro combined generated more electricity than its fossil fuels – a milestone that will happen anyway over the next couple of years. Wind is cheap, but your electricity isn’t Wind generation also recovered from its relatively poor output in 2021 to reach a record generation of 77 TWh. That’s a 24% increase on the preceding year, when capacity increased by just 11%. This sudden increase highlights the year-to-year variations that need to be planned for to have a robust and resilient decarbonised power system, including longer duration energy storage. Renewables (including generation from biomass) contributed nearly 40% of Britain’s total generation in 2022. This progress, along with the lower demand for electricity within Britain, meant emissions from the power sector were broadly similar to previous years (though would have been lower if imports from France had continued). The rising prices of electricity and gas have contributed to a cost of living crisis, putting millions in fuel poverty. And though renewables and nuclear together provided over half of Britain’s electricity in 2022, the system is still overwhelmingly influenced by prices set by fossil fuel plants. Reforms are urgently needed here to decouple the price of low-carbon electricity from that of fossil fuels.",Britain is a net electricity exporter for first time in 44 years,https://theconversation.com/britain-is-a-net-electricity-exporter-for-first-time-in-44-years-197506

The Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the BBC's Today programme and the rest of the doomsters may be convinced that we face some terrible economic apocalypse. But the facts refuse to oblige. Confounding all expectations, output in Britain grew by 0.1pc in November, leading financial analyst across the City to upgrade forecasts. That means we're not in a recession after all. And it could get even better when we see the official December data. In spite of all the doom and gloom about a disastrous seasonal shopping season British consumers did what they do best and opened their wallets. The result? Retail sales soared — right in the midst of the 'cost of living crisis'. Growth in November was driven by the UK's resilient services sector — everything from haircuts and shopping malls to the banks and legal services of the City, as well as entertainment and communications. It accounts for nearly 79 per cent of our national output. (Construction was flat, hindered by rising interest rates, while manufacturing dipped.) So in spite of months of bad news from Downing Street in the form of tax hikes and budget cuts — as well as a seemingly never-ending stream of headlines about soaring energy bills, rampant inflation and relentless strike actions — Christmas 2022 brought excellent economic news. From the high street to the retail park, sales were brisk. Shopping boomed across the country, with almost every category in the sector — be it supermarket groceries, beauty products at Boots, or Nike Air Force trainers — keeping the tills rattling throughout the festive period. Marks & Spencer, far from being the busted flush of popular imagination, saw turkeys and sparkling wine help to deliver a 6.3 per cent gain in sales through its food halls. Mid-market Sainsbury's, thought to be a victim of competition from German value retailers Aldi and Lidl, also defied the odds with a 7.1 per cent rise in sales over Christmas. High street giants Tesco, Next and Lidl have all done impressively, too. as have local favourites Greggs and Boots. Corks were also popping at the UK's biggest wine retailer Majestic, where price cuts brought shoppers through the doors in droves. Stunningly, sales were 21.1 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. JD Sports, meanwhile, recorded a 20 per cent lift in sales over the holiday period, driven by 2.6 million pairs of Nike trainers. But it's not just shops. In aviation, passenger numbers at Heathrow were up 90 per cent on the 2021 festive period — when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 blighted festive getaways — defying industrial action by border staff. Elsewhere, in spite of this week's aborted Virgin Orbit launch in Cornwall, the UK's space sector is booming, with Germany's Rocket Factory Augsburg signing a multi-year partnership for a planned launch on the Shetland Islands. The industry generates £16.5 billion of income. And, in another boost, this week's news of a gas find in the southern North Sea by a Shell-led consortium has been hailed as 'fantastic'. The good tidings continue. The Office for National Statistics reported this week that, in 2021, UK output per hour worked 'had the fastest growth of the G7 countries'. Not something likely to lead BBC headlines. Banking giant JP Morgan Chase says that about three-quarters of its mid-size UK business leaders (the backbone of our economy) plan to grow their enterprises this year — and have no plans to shed jobs. So, when all this is accounted for, and despite all the dire talk from the Bank of England and others about the longest recession in our history, things could be turning out far better than expected. And saying this matters. Because drumbeats of bad economic forecasts can fast become self-perpetuating, ramping up the gloom and helping to delay our recovery. Even Doomster-in-Chief — Chancellor Jeremy Hunt — now believes that the economic slow-down will be milder than forecast. So why isn't he — and, indeed, our glum Prime Minister — leading by example and shouting the positive news from the rooftops? After all, it is the Conservative Party's 'energy price guarantee' on people's bills (established under the Liz Truss debacle and largely embraced by Sunak and Hunt), along with targeted help for the poorest families unveiled by Sunak when he was still at the Treasury, that together have taken the sting out of household gas and electricity costs. And that's in addition to the recent sharp fall in the price of wholesale gas, as a result of the extraordinarily mild European winter — one of the warmest in half a century. This has reduced demand and lowered tariffs, further helping to cut the cost of living. Yet despite these successes, Nos 10 and 11 have echoed the pessimistic economists who were still insisting at the end of last year that consumers as well as retailers were bound to suffer badly this winter. The British Retail Consortium's Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said in early December that 'the cost of living crisis means many families might dial back their festive plans'. She could not have been more wrong. It's clear then that, while cost pressures are real, people have not stopped spending. How is this possible? Amid the purported misery, it seems families are still determined to enjoy themselves. My view is that the soothsayers have underestimated two post-pandemic factors. That big savings balances approaching £200 billion, built-up during the pandemic, have been sitting around ready to be spent. And that, ahead of the holidays, fewer credit cards had been swiped to their limits than in previous years. The British Retail Consortium continues to warn that because of further rises in the cost of living, retailers face headwinds in 2023. Maybe so. But inflation is forecast to fall dramatically, wholesale gas prices have tumbled and the employment market remains strong, with more than 1 million vacancies. The pessimism is being overdone. There is still some way to go, but that should not preclude our leaders hailing the resilience of the British consumer, or the skill with which industries across the board managing their way through difficult times.

The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said the new strike days are in addition to the previously announced 16-day programme of rolling strike action, set to begin in schools across the country next week. The EIS Executive Committee met on Friday and agreed action that will include two days of strikes in all schools and sectors on February 28 and March 1, followed by a rolling programme of strikes for 20 days between March 13 and April 21. Each local authority area will be impacted by three consecutive days of strikes, with one day affecting all schools bookended on either side by one-day strikes in primary and secondary schools. EIS members have previously taken three days of strikes, one in November and two in January, in the continuing campaign for a fair pay settlement for the year 2022. Primary and secondary schools were closed on Tuesday January 10 and Wednesday January 11 after last-ditch talks with the Scottish Government failed. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. Speaking after the meeting of EIS Executive Committee, general secretary Andrea Bradley said: “The programme of additional strike action, agreed today, is a direct response to the inaction of the Scottish Government and Cosla (Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) on teacher pay. “After a year of dither, delay and disingenuity from the Scottish Government and Cosla, Scotland’s teachers have simply had enough.” Ms Bradley added: “The recent days of strike action by Scotland’s teachers have succeeded in bringing Cosla and the Scottish Government back to the negotiating table but they have yet to put a single extra penny onto that table. “Scotland’s teachers rejected a sub-inflationary 5% offer six months ago, and little or no progress has been made in negotiations since. “The prospect of 22 additional days of strike action, on top of the 16 days of rolling action set to begin next week, should signal clearly to the Scottish Government and Cosla that they must now act with urgency. “Our members are resolute and determined to secure a fair pay settlement, which both properly reflects their value and also takes account of the soaring cost of living.” Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “Strikes in our schools are in no one’s interest – including for pupils, parents and carers who have already had to deal with significant disruption over the past three years. “It is disappointing that the EIS has proceeded to escalate industrial action – we are continuing to urge teaching unions to reconsider their plans while talks are ongoing. “Recent discussions have been constructive. There has been a shared understanding that talks have been focused on discussing potential areas for compromise – not on tabling a new offer at this stage. “To date we have made four offers, all of which have been rejected, but we remain absolutely committed to reaching an agreement on a pay deal that is fair and sustainable for all concerned.”",Teaching union announces 22 more days of strike action in Scotland,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-government-scotland-children-education-secretary-b2261914.html

The GMB union has written to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, accusing him of ""demonising"" paramedics, call handlers and emergency care assistants who are striking over pay and conditions. Ministers have accused workers of putting lives at risk during strikes. In response, Downing Street said it ""greatly valued"" ambulance workers and the ""door remains open"" for talks. GMB represent more than 10,000 ambulance workers who went on strike on Wednesday across nine ambulance services in England and Wales. Steve Rice, writing on behalf of the GMB Ambulance Committee, said he was ""appalled"" at recent government statements and accused ministers of attempting to remove workers' right to strike . He wrote: ""We feel utterly betrayed by the way your government has singled out ambulance workers as part of a crude attempt to remove our right to strike.

The letter comes after the prime minister described the industrial action as ""terrifying"". He told the Commons on Wednesday: ""What is terrifying is that right now people do not know whether, when they call 999, they will get the treatment they need."" Business Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs that ""a lack of timely co-operation"" from unions was ""putting their constituents' lives at risk."" Responding to the GMB letter, Downing Street said the health secretary's door remains open to talks with unions and it has accepted the independent pay review body's recommendation to give one million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. A spokesperson said: ""However, we must keep the public safe, which is why we are introducing minimum service and safety levels across a range of sectors to ensure that lives and livelihoods are not lost."" Mr Sunak said he hoped to ""find a way through"" the deadlock with unions to avert further industrial action and touted the minimum service level legislation. The Bill is due to considered by MPs again on Monday. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner tweeted: ""Ministers know this shoddy, unworkable Bill won't do a thing to help working people or avoid strikes.""

Astrologists predict it will be a year of hope as the rabbit is a symbol of longevity, peace and prosperity in Chinese culture. The prospect of a better year ahead is certainly something investors in the region will be hoping for. China had a difficult 2022 with tightening tech sector regulations, a property building crisis that curbed investment, and strict Covid-19 restrictions that dampened consumption. As a result, growth levels achieved in the year will likely be significantly below the annual target of 5.5%. At the end of last year Chinese authorities offered some “hope” for growth by terminating its three years of zero-Covid restrictions and lifting almost all constraints that damaged the property sector. These coordinated policy responses led economists to increase their GDP forecasts for the year ahead, with China likely to be the only major economy to grow faster in 2023 than in 2022 (the forecasted growth rate is 4.8 per cent in 2023, against 3% for last year). At the upcoming National People’s Congress in March the government may decide to set a growth target of 5% for 2023. The target needs to be ambitious enough to boost confidence, particularly when growth is deteriorating in many regions. But it must also remain realistic to avoid two consecutive years of growth disappointment. One area of concern is a surge in Covid-19 cases. Since restrictions have been lifted there has been an exponential rise in infections. While accurate data is hard to source, a number of local governments have estimated 60-85% of their population contracted Covid-19 in December. As this wave of infections escalates – with people moving around the country for the Lunar New Year – it will put enormous strain on already pressured hospitals, particularly as medical shortages continue across major cities. The faster-than-expected easing of restrictions will therefore initially be disruptive to the recovery, as shown by recent economic indicators. Nevertheless, with Covid-19 restrictions removed and with continued support for the property market, the Chinese economy should accelerate in the second quarter of the year, especially if the current wave of infections subsides, allowing activity to pick up. That said, a repeat of the V-shaped recovery seen in 2021 after the initial Covid-19 shock should not be expected as the property market will take longer to recover and gain investor confidence. What about inflation? Many economies around the world have had to deal with spiralling inflation throughout 2022, albeit China is the outlier with the most recent consumer price index in December rising at 1.8% (year-on-year). As China advances the easing of Covid restrictions, inflation will potentially accelerate due to pent-up demand and government growth policies. It could easily accelerate beyond the official target of 3% in 2023, similar to what happened in other major economies after reopening. Chinese households are cash rich, demand will be tilted towards consumption, and a decent rebound in retail sales is likely, given the last print in November was a decline of 5.9% (year-on-year). There are already signs of this pent-up demand as bookings for international travel have surged. China re-opening will undoubtedly cause higher inflation, and many western central bankers will be wary of this. However, the impact of that re-opening should have limited impact on global inflation. Whilst there will also be a need for more energy from China; Chinese imports of crude oil and liquefied natural gas are already back to pre-pandemic levels. China is a large consumer of commodities and there has already been a surge in iron ore, up more than 40% since bottoming in late October 2022. Any further resurgence in commodities will depend heavily on how China stimulates the economy, and it is somehow difficult to envisage a resurgence in construction in the short term, which should limit commodity upside. Ultimately the speed of easing of coronavirus restrictions has surprised many, and it seems China is prioritising growth above all else. In terms of prosperity at least, the Year of the Rabbit may well bring some welcome respite.

But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Commuters on their way to work cross London Bridge in central London on 3 January 2023 (AFP via Getty Images) Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal. “We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love.

Paul Nowak called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions. It comes as rail workers continue a 48 hour strike, with more stoppages planned this month in the transport industry, NHS and civil service. In a letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing.” Read the details in this report: New TUC boss calls for urgent meeting with Prime Minister Paul Nowak demands a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions.

It wasn’t until this past year watching Musk, Johnson, Trump, King Charles, Truss, Clarkson (who is not out of the woods, however much cover The Sun give him) etc that it occurred to me that, if you are patient enough and prepared to witness massive collateral damage and waste of resources and unnecessary heartache, worsening socio-economic inequality and the debasement of living conditions for the most vulnerable – “they” implode...

Rishi Sunak has been warned that his “high risk” strategy on public sector pay rises could backfire, as an exclusive poll for The Independent showed strong public support for fresh strikes in 2023. Almost two in three voters would back NHS nurses taking more strike action next year if their pay demands are not met, the Savanta poll found, with only 24 per cent opposed. In addition, more voters expressed support for fresh industrial action by rail staff, bus drivers, postal workers and teachers than those who said they were opposed to further strikes. Adam Forrest reports: What does Britain really think about the strikes? As unions and government continue their stand-off, voters are still backing the workers who have chosen to walk out, polling finds – and they support more strikes in the new year, Adam Forrest reports Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 02:48 1672796880 As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be a good year for the unions After decades when it was – sadly – usually safe to ignore the pronouncements of union leaders, the most widespread outbreak of industrial action since 1979 has meant that they are household names once again. Not yet as familiar as, say, Mick Lynch, is the brand new general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Paul Nowak, who formally takes over from Frances (now Baroness) O’Grady on 1 January. He is, though, making a somewhat loud entrance. He told The Independent that the strikes could carry on throughout 2023 if the government refuses to negotiate over pay rises. If we take ministers at their word, that they won’t do so until at least the new public pay body recommendations arrive in April, then the country is in for a prolonged period of conflict. Writes Sean O’Grady: As strikes look set to continue, 2023 could be good for the unions The economic reality is on the side of the unions, and Rishi Sunak lacks Thatcher’s sharp political instinct, writes Sean O'Grady Eleanor Sly4 January 2023 01:48 1672793280 I’m a nurse – this is why I voted to strike Ever since I was a young child, I dreamt of being a nurse that worked for the NHS. Twelve years ago, after lots of hard work and determination, I achieved that goal. There were lots of sacrifices from my family, who supported me throughout my course. I currently work as a deputy sister in an NHS hospital in Lincolnshire. My role is as part of an acute cardiology team that has face to face contact with patients that attend the hospital after having heart attacks and following cardiac arrests.

Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 23:34 1672786137 Who is striking this winter and why? Workers in several of Britain’s key service sectors are striking in what is being called the new “winter of discontent” as cost of living pressures clash with below-inflation pay offers. Many strikes, such as that of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), have been going on for months, with warnings union members will vote to take their fight far into 2023. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the highest monthly total since November 2011 saw mass public sector walkouts over pension reforms. Liam James reports: Who is striking this winter and why? Workers are walking out in droves over the coming weeks Eleanor Sly3 January 2023 22:48 1672783170 Bus strikes planned for Wednesday TfL has said that strike are planned for Wednesday and Thursday on Abellio bus services. On the strike days, TfL writes that they intend to run as many services as possible, but expect disruption. Routes affected by the strikes are, for the most part, in west and south London. Other bus services will not be affected.

The wild salmon is one of Scotland’s most iconic species, earning its place alongside the red deer, the golden eagle, and the Scottish wildcat. But, like so many other animals, its numbers have been in decline for decades. The population of wild salmon is diminishing on the west coast of Scotland, and even faster on the east coast. Reasons for the fall are many and varied, but a key cause is habitat loss and rising river temperatures, due to climate change. The Scottish Government has also identified other pressures facing wild salmon, including predation by fish, birds and seals, as well as the non-native plans that erode riverbanks. Man-made barriers to migration, such as weirs and bridge foundations, lead to further challenges for the fish, impeding their migration to spawning grounds and increasing the likelihood of them being eaten. The sad truth is that a wild Atlantic salmon now has a miniscule survival rate of only around 1-2%. That contrasts sharply with farm-raised salmon, where the survival rate is around 85% over their two years in the cold seas off Scotland’s west coast. Daily animal husbandry from our salmon farmers, supported by the best vets in the land, has developed world-leading expertise in hatching and rearing salmon that thrive at sea. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part There are a handful of vocal activists, often from urban centres far from rural Scotland, determined to shut down salmon farms – which would make 12,000 people unemployed amid a cost of living crisis – who mistakenly believe that this would somehow help wild salmon. They have no explanation, of course, for the fact that wild salmon numbers are declining at the same rate on the east coast, where there has never been any salmon farming. What is needed is collaboration, not confrontation. Scotland’s salmon farmers want to play their part in finding solutions, engaging constructively with the wild fish sector, and taking meaningful action to save wild salmon. They are determined, for example, to share their knowledge and experience to support wild fisheries with restocking. Fortunately, most people in the fisheries and angling sectors in the Highlands and Islands recognise the importance of a healthy, shared environment, ensuring fish can thrive in our waters. People like Jon Gibb, a fisheries manager based in Fort William, get that. He has long championed a constructive relationship between the farm-raised salmon sector and fisheries and angling groups, arguing that “both the farmed and wild salmon sectors have a common interest to thrive in our shared space”. I agree, which is why I’m delighted that Jon has agreed to coordinate our revamped £1.5 million “wild fisheries fund”, which is paid for directly by Scotland’s salmon farming companies. Funding to protect our salmon heritage The Scottish salmon sector has already funded projects to save and restore a historic dam in the Western Isles that assists wild salmon to progress to their spawning grounds, as well as restoration projects across Scotland that will reduce riverbank erosion and provide tree canopy and in-stream cover for young salmon. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks In the coming year, £145,000 will be available to a broad range of organisations and projects. Applications are invited from fisheries organisations, including local angling clubs, fishery boards and other community associations. The revamped fund will prioritise applications of a practical nature, which aim to protect and enhance wild salmon populations and local angling opportunities, recognising that salmon and trout fishing is at the cultural heart of many Highland communities, and provides human health benefits. Projects could include removing migration barriers, evidence-based and authorised restocking programmes, hatchery-based operations using contemporary techniques, such as genetic screening, and freshwater habitat improvement, like spawning gravel creation. Money is also available for improvements to angling facilities, including riverside paths, boats and buildings, as well as initiatives to support young and disabled anglers. Scottish salmon is part of our national story. The fish has a rich history, but we all need to work together in ensuring a long-term future for wild stocks. We recognise that today’s Scottish salmon farming sector enjoys its strong reputation and success partly due to this heritage. It is in all of our interests to ensure that we protect our freshwater and seawater environment so that one of Scotland’s most iconic species can recover and thrive.

Hardies Property & Construction Consultants is currently renovating its offices in the city. Once the offices on Albert Square are ready, bosses plan to have staff from Hardies and its sister company Shepherds working under the same roof. They will be joined by workers from the recently-acquired John Duguid Partnership. Hardies investment in Dundee offices Gareth Cordiner, the firm’s north division managing partner, believes this will make a real difference. He said: “It’s hugely important especially after Covid. We do have a flexible working policy but we’ve found people want to be back in the office and back together. “The amount of information you share from hearing it across the room, it makes a big difference. “From a mental health point of view it’s brilliant. You see relationships building again, so there’s huge benefits.” Douglas Smith, who was appointed Dundee partner recently, added: “We’ll have our one-stop-shop under one roof and that’s really exciting. “It needs to be a more modern way, with collective thinking.” Mr Smith also outlined his ambition for Hardies to become the go-to business for anyone’s surveying requirements in Dundee. “It’s a pretty exciting time for Hardies in Dundee,” he said. “We’ve got a fairly big team that are looking to make giant strides in the Tayside area moving forward. “We’re trying to build the Hardies brand. “In Dundee, we’re trying to make it a one-stop shop surveying service across all disciplines – building surveying, quantity surveying, you name it, we’re doing it. “We’re going to target sectors we want to work in.” Tayside offices crucial for Hardies Mr Cordiner said its presence in Tayside and Fife – the firm also has offices in Dunfermline, St Andrews and Perth – are key to the business. He added: “Dundee and Perth work closely together as the Tayside region. “Historically in Dundee quantity surveying-wise, we’re historically very strong and very well known. “Joining up with the John Duguid Partnership we’re keen that we become the strongest quantity surveying team in Tayside. “I don’t think we’re far off that at the moment.” Mr Smith said the firm’s progress would be based on “considered and selective movement”.",Dundee property firm looking to make &#8216;giant strides&#8217; in Tayside,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/business-environment/business/4001080/hardies-dundee/

Henrik Adam, Chairman of Tata Steel UK which has a pipe mill at Hartlepool, said: “Recent events have shown us just how crucial it is to have a secure energy supply. Achieving this will need an energy revolution in this country requiring millions of tonnes of steel to build new energy generation projects. ""A strong domestic and secure steel industry is also fundamental to delivering the UK Government’s ambitious energy plans. “But if British manufacturers are to supply the essential steel and continue to employ many thousands of people in this country, we need to invest and transform this strategically-important industry so it can make carbon-neutral steel. “Similarly, our steel industry is at a crossroads – if we do nothing, we risk it declining and drifting away to other countries. Down the other path is a new era in which we transform the steel production process to make it fit for the 21st Century.” Henrik added: “Geo-political events and disruptive trade issues in recent years have reminded us of the importance of being self-sufficient in essential products like steel, a product critical for the UK’s infrastructure projects, manufacturing industry and national security.” Roy Rickhuss CBE, General Secretary of Community and NTUSCC Chair, said: “The green energy revolution presents a huge opportunity to build a robust British supply chain based on the supply of top-quality domestic steel.""

British wrestler Zack Sabre Jr, who has been vocally anti-Tory in the past, stepped out for a high stakes match at New Japan Pro Wrestling’s (NJPW) Wrestle Kingdom 17 event in front of a packed Tokyo Dome crowd. With a global audience tuning in to see former WWE superstar Sasha Banks make her heavily rumoured debut, the 35-year-old grappler took his opportunity to shine a light on the action being taken by the Royal College of Nursing (RNC). Back in November, for the first first time in its 106 year history the RNC voted in favour of strikes, as walkouts affected hospitals across the country with more set to take place on January 18 and 19. Zack has joined those criticising the government over the dispute, and he sent a very blunt message for the Prime Minister as he made his entrance on Wednesday (January 4). Looking straight down the camera, he said: ‘Hey Rishi Sunak! Pay nurses, d**khead! Pay nurses a living wage!’ Zack has a message for the prime minister pic.twitter.com/ECbWf0EX1O— Elijah (@eli1ah) January 4, 2023 Zack Sabre Jr has fans around the world (Picture: Etsuo Hara/Getty Images) Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said last month that the union had ‘no choice’ but to arrange the upcoming strikes. She said: ‘The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January. ‘The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.’ The union is campaigning for a five percent pay rise above inflation to help nurses overcome those real-terms pay cuts, to support nursing staff through the cost of living crisis and recognise their critical skills. There are also record nursing vacancies, with 25,000 nursing staff having quit in the past year, but Mr Sunak previously said while the government was open to talks, a demand for a 19% pay rise wasn’t affordable. He told BBC News NI in December: ‘The health secretary has always been clear that his door is always open for talks – we want to be reasonable, we want to be constructive. ‘We’ve got enormous gratitude for all public sector workers for the job they do, and I know things are difficult right now.’ Got a story?

Al-Quds reported that they had been deported for a range of reasons, including drug abuse, theft, expiration of residency and acting against the public interest. Egyptians are the largest expat group in Kuwait, constituting 24 per cent of the workforce, though that number looks set to reduce as the government works on controlling the labour market and reducing the number of expats across all sectors, particularly within the government. In 2018 Kuwait's Civil Service Commission issued a decree to replace expats in government jobs with Kuwaitis over the next five years. Since then, authorities have rolled out a series of measures aimed at reducing foreign workers in the country. In 2020 Kuwait's parliament said it wanted to reduce the number of Egyptians in the country to ten per cent and introduced a draft law to that effect. In December this year the Kuwaiti government imposed new conditions on Egyptian workers wishing to travel to the Gulf State including a $100 entry fee, an increased work permit documentation fee and a medical examination. READ: Kuwait: death sentence for man who killed woman who refused his advances At the time, Deputy Prime Minister Talal Al-Khaled suspended a 2018 memorandum of understanding which was originally signed to facilitate recruitment between the two countries but did not officially inform Egypt it was being terminated. Four months earlier Kuwait announced that it would lay off 250,000 Egyptian workers and suspend all contracts with non-nationals as 500,000 other Egyptians were already set to lose their jobs. Egyptians have suffered racism in the Gulf country with a video of a Kuwaiti customer slapping an Egyptian cashier two years ago going viral. One influencer called Egyptians ""filthy servants."" Even though they are the largest expatriate group in Kuwait, Egyptians lack employment rights and safety provision. In November last year an Egyptian construction worker was killed in Kuwait allegedly after his colleagues dumped rubbish on him from the third floor after not realising he was below them. A 2015 report on migrant rights found that industry corruption, including overextending project timelines and using cheap materials, put construction workers at risk.

He called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions.

He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline. “Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it. “This is simply unsustainable. “But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes. “That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.” Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now. “Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution. “In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers.

Companies affected by the strike are Avanti West Coast; Chiltern Railways; CrossCountry; East Midlands Railway; Great Western Railway; Greater Anglia; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; London North Eastern Railway; Northern Trains; Southeastern; Southern/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway (depot drivers only); SWR Island Line; TransPennine Express; and West Midlands Trains.New TUC leader Paul Nowak has written to the Prime Minister calling for an urgent meeting to discuss the wave of industrial disputes across the country including on the railways, NHS and civil service.He called for a change in government direction, saying ministers should open pay negotiations with unions.In the letter to Rishi Sunak, Mr Nowak said public services were in crisis after years of “underfunding and understaffing”.He wrote: “We can’t solve these problems without a fair deal for the people on the frontline.“Every month experienced employees are quitting, with one in three public service staff now taking steps to leave their professions or actively considering it.“This is simply unsustainable.“But we cannot fix the staffing crisis in our schools, hospitals and elsewhere if we do not fix the underlying causes.“That means talking in an open and constructive way about improving public sector pay. But so far your ministers have refused to negotiate directly about pay with unions.”Mr Nowak said unions worked closely with Mr Sunak during the pandemic to deliver the furlough scheme and protect millions of jobs, adding: “That’s the kind of mature approach we need now.“Unions have already made clear their willingness to sit down with the Government and talk about boosting pay. But while your ministers continue to refuse point blank to discuss improving wages, there can be no resolution.“In the NHS, for example, appropriate structures already exist to allow the immediate start of pay negotiations involving health unions, employers and ministers. This was exactly what happened in 2018, leading to the three-year wage deal.“We want to find a resolution to the current disputes so our public service staff can get on with doing the jobs they love. And so our public services can start to improve for everyone who relies on them.” RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has warned that industrial action will need to continue beyond May unless a reasonable offer to resolve the row over pay, jobs and conditions is made to the union.On Wednesday, the DVSA driving examiners’ strike started in London, the South East, South Wales and the South West, while traffic officer service workers at National Highways and Rural Payments Agency staff continued their walkouts.London bus workers at Abellio began a two-day strike – the first in a series of action planned by the group throughout January.",Train drivers&amp;rsquo; strike will cripple services as union leaders warn of escalation,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/train-drivers-strike-will-cripple-services-as-union-leaders-warn-of-escalation-42262262.html

Next, we need to stop seeing education is something that ends at age 18 or that sees university as the only option with more technical education, lifelong learning and apprenticeship,” he said. We're holding the first BUSINESSiQ Awards - to nominate someone, CLICK HERE He told an audience in Stratford: “One of the biggest changes in mindset we need in education today is to reimagine our approach to numeracy. Right now, just half of all 16 to 19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills, is letting our children down.” Rishi Sunak (Image: PA) Grant Glendinning, Chief Executive and Group Principal at Education Training Collective (Etc.), replied: “I fully agree with the Prime Minister, opportunity is intrinsically linked with education – ensuring that learners have access to the best possible learning experiences. However, while maths, and English, are important and critical foundations of any education pathway towards employment, they do not work in isolation. ""Skills as a whole, starting with English and maths, developed from primary into secondary education, supported by additional learning and development in further education or in the workplace as part of an apprenticeship or T Level, are what will see our young people best positioned to take advantage of the careers and opportunities they pursue, supporting the economic growth of our country. Grant Glendinning (Image: Press release) It will be interesting to understand how this will be rolled out, but with the best interests of our learners and our communities firmly at the heart of Etc. colleges, it is difficult to see how enhanced skills development can be anything but a positive.” Zoe Lewis, Principal and Chief Executive of Middlesbrough College, told us: ""The UK is one of the few developed nations that reduces the time spent in education from around 25 hours per week from the age of 5 to 16 years old to around 16 hours per week between the ages of 16 and 18. Zoe Lewis (Image: Press release) ""We would welcome any opportunity to increase the hours available to continue the development of key skills required for life and the workplace in our young people, whether this be mathematics, English, digital, physical education or employability skills. ""Whilst we would not necessarily single out mathematics from the list of priority skills, we would very much support any increase in investment between in the ages of 16 and 18, alongside a clear plan as to how we can develop and train the increased numbers of teachers that would be required, in light of the current shortages across the sector."" Henri Murison, Chief Executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership said businesses needed young people who were ready for work: ""The Prime Minister is right to be concerned about the progress made by disadvantaged children in this country,"" he said. ""It is simply not good enough that 60% of children do not receive a high enough grade at GCSE in maths to make it on to a T-Level course or other vocation routes to further study. Henri Murison (Image: Press release) ""However it's worth noting that already many young people are studying maths post 16 through resits, in order to get the grade they need to make it through to the system to achieve a higher level of skills.

After the disappointments of the previous decade, this was to be the time when the global economy powered up and got going again. There would be a flowering of new technologies and a colossal boom. It would be the roaring 20s all over again. It hasn’t worked out like that. Instead, the world faces the grim prospect of a second recession in three years. The three biggest economies – the United States, China and the European Union, which between them account for roughly half of all global output – are slowing at the same time. That’s unusual and troubling. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, says a third of the world economy will be in recession in 2023, and even for countries that manage to keep growing it will feel like a recession. The IMF has got it wrong – sometimes seriously wrong – in the past but even so, Georgieva’s pessimism is warranted. Just about every indicator of looming recession is flashing red. Prices are rising faster than wages, reducing consumer spending power. Corporate profitability is being squeezed by rising costs and weakening demand. Developing countries that borrowed heavily when interest rates were low are now finding their debt burdens unmanageable. The two big asset bubbles of the post-pandemic era – crypto-currencies and tech stocks – both collapsed in 2022. Central banks are raising interest rates, exposing the vulnerability of “zombie” companies that have survived only thanks to a prolonged period of low interest rates. It is a lot cheaper in the US to borrow money for 10 years than it is to borrow money for one year. In the past this unusual phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, has been a telltale sign of a recession in the offing. China hauled the global economy out of its last serious downturn but is in no shape to do so this time. House prices have been rising at double-digit rates for the past three decades but are now falling in many cities because the boom has led to more and more homes being built. Politically, President Xi Jinping cannot afford a house price crash so he can bring demand and supply back into balance only by curbing property construction. That, coupled with the increase in coronavirus cases since the end of the zero tolerance approach to Covid-19, means China is the country to watch in 2023. The IMF says that for the first time since the early 1990s, China will grow less quickly than the global economy as a whole. It could be worse than the IMF envisages. So, the big question is not whether the global economy is in for a rough year in the 12 months ahead, because that is clearly the case. There may be one or two countries that buck the trend, but the UK is not going to be one of them. Another year of underperformance will keep the debate about Brexit alive, even though adjustment to life outside the EU is not the only – let alone the principal reason – for the UK’s current predicament. This is a global rather than a UK-specific problem, and it predates Brexit. Nor is the question why the bounce-back from the Covid-19 pandemic has been cut short, because that too is obvious. The post-lockdown recovery was built on the shakiest of foundations. Shortages led to a burst of inflation, amplified by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Central banks in the west found themselves powerless to combat a cost of living crisis other than by jacking up interest rates. The recessions or near recessions that will be seen in the US, the EU and the UK this year are no accident. They are a deliberate act of policy, which central bankers justify by saying it is a choice between pain now or more pain later. No, the real issue is whether the roaring 20s have been delayed or will never arrive. Put another way: is the global economy facing a temporary, if nasty, period of stagflation (a combination of weak growth and high inflation) or something deeper: a crisis of capitalism? And if it is the latter, what can be done about it? History may well repeat itself. The 1920s began with a pandemic, an inflationary boom and a deep recession. It took a while for better times to arrive, and when they did the driving force was a wave of new inventions, first developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but which took time to reveal their full potential. Techno-optimists say artificial intelligence and biotechnology will be to the 2020s what radio and the motorcar were to the 1920s: the catalyst for a period of markedly faster growth. They believe a period of abnormally lower interest rates has held back a fourth industrial revolution by allowing no-hoper companies to stagger on. A period of creative destruction will see this misallocation of capital end, leading to higher investment in the industries of the future. But the global economy has now been in the doldrums for 15 years. Money has been cheap and plentiful ever since the banks nearly went bust during the global financial crisis. There is not much evidence to suggest that the fourth industrial revolution is being held back by a shortage of capital. Rather, there has been a reluctance by both governments and the private sector to invest. Governments could have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs to rebuild clapped-out infrastructure, but failed to do so. The private sector preferred to use profits to buy back shares rather than taking a punt on new products. Financial engineering proved lucrative for elites, who assumed – quite wrongly – that because the system was working for them it was working for everybody. In one respect, the roaring 20s have already returned. While living standards are being squeezed for the many, for the super-rich it is a new gilded age. Three factors were behind the massive jump in productivity in the middle decades of the 20th century: ideas, investment and the struggle against inequality. Economies only really started to motor when new products were available to the masses through policies that encouraged full employment, collective bargaining and rising wages. Currently, there are plenty of ideas but the other two factors are missing. Until that changes, the global economy will be stuck in its low-growth rut.

It is estimated just 10% of services will be running on one of the worst days of action for decades. Around 12,500 train drivers from 15 firms will take part in the mass walkout. It comes as over the last week we have seen strike action from 40,000 workers on Network Rail and 14 train operating companies who have continued to strike. RMT members were on strike for 48 hours causing travel chaos for people across the UK. But today it is the turn of Aslef – which represents 96% of the train drivers in England, Scotland and Wales – who will continue into their second day of strikes in two days. Rail workers on the picket line at Grand Central Station in Birmingham yesterday (Picture: PA) MORE : What strikes are planned around New Year 2023? Trains, London buses, road workers and more The strike will bring services on affected lines to a halt and comes as more and more people in many different sectors of the economy are withdrawing their labour as employers refuse to help their employees during the cost-of-living crisis. But it’s not the end, as those from The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers are also set to walk out tomorrow and on Friday. It includes train drivers at 15 rail operators and is likely to shut down much of the country’s rail network. On all five days of action, trains will start later and finish much earlier than usual, running between 7.30am and 6.30pm, National Rail has warned. Tickets for 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 January can instead be used the day before the date on the ticket, or up to and including Tuesday 10 January.

Train drivers are joined today by London bus workers at Abellio, who are striking for eight days in total this month. Abellio buses have been affected on strike days – with other buses running but busier than usual. The action started back on December 8, but the bus strike dates around New Year included today and yesterday. Dozens of buses in London are going to be impacted by strikes. Rural Payments Agency (RPA) staff will also resume their strikes. Driving tests have likewise been disrupted today – with DVSA driving examiners’ strike starting in London, the South East, South Wales and the South West. ‘We don’t want to go on strike but the companies have pushed us into this place,’ said Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef. He added: ‘They have not offered our members at these companies a penny – and these are people who have not had an increase since April 2019. ‘That means they expect train drivers at these companies to take a real-terms pay cut – to work just as hard for considerably less – when inflation is running at north of 14%.’ Mick said: ‘The train companies say their hands have been tied by the government. While the government – which does not employ us – says it’s up to the companies to negotiate with us. ‘We are always happy to negotiate – we never refuse to sit down at the table and talk – but these companies have offered us nothing.

The latest statistics on Scotland’s energy production (not oil and gas reserves) showed that over the first nine months of 2022, generation was up 34.7% compared to the same period in 2021 Final figures for 2021 show that the equivalent of 85.2% of all electricity used in Scotland (total generation minus net exports) came from renewable sources. Due to slightly better weather in 2021 this was actually a slight decrease, but has bounced back up again with the 2022 figures. The energy that is generated in Scotland is exported into the UK National Grid. Consumers in Scotland then buy it back. The further north you go in Scotland the tariff paid for buying it back, increases. So although places like Orkney and the massive windfarms in the north of mainland Scotland are producing well over their own needs in renewables, they are also paying the highest prices to buy back their own locally produced power. Scotland produces most of its renewable energy through wind but hydro is also very important. The future with wave and tidal power makes Scotland’s future as a producer of clean energy very bright. Oil and Gas in the UK Scotland still produces large amounts of fossil fuels through its existing extensive oil and gas fields. The income generated from these sources goes into the UK Exchequer. The UK Government is also very keen to open up more oil and gas fields. Figures from the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS) The oil and gas industry plays a central role in the economy of the United Kingdom. Oil and gas account for more than three-quarters of the UK’s total primary energy needs. Oil provides 97 per cent of the fuel for transport, and gas is a key fuel for heating and electricity generation. Transport, heating and electricity each account for about one-third of the UK’s primary energy needs. Oil and gas are also major feedstocks for the petrochemicals industries producing pharmaceuticals, plastics, cosmetics and domestic appliances. Wikipedia Click on this link for more information on UK Oil and Gas: North Sea Transition Authority Scotland’s Renewable Production Energy is mostly a reserved power to the UK Government. The Scottish Government has planning power over the development of wind farms as we have seen recently in Orkney (OIC Faray Windfarm Approved by Scottish Government Despite Reporter’s Recommendation to Refuse ) and licences to develop offshore wind. (Islanders Attend Consultation Events for the West of Orkney Windfarm) There is a major expansion of the wind generation sector in Scotland. In the last twelve months, renewable electricity capacity has risen, up 11.7% from September 2021 to 13.6 GW in September 2022. As of September 2022, 397 renewable electricity projects with a capacity of 17.1 GW are being progressed. 3.4 GW of these are under construction, most of which are offshore wind farms off the Moray Firth. 6.8 GW are awaiting construction and 6.9 GW in planning. The generation and use of energy is a complex picture in Scotland. As part of the UK and with a devolved system of government, control over energy is mostly reserved to the London Government. Oil and Gas is a major sector. The UK Government intends to expand both this and Nuclear production. As well as producing energy we also need to use less but as the weather in 2022 was better for renewable generation it also made our homes and businesses harder to heat. Fuel poverty should not exist in a country which generates so much energy – but it does because we do not control the price or have the means to do so. Scottish Government funded schemes to make our homes and businesses more energy efficient are extremely important (more about that here, Home Energy Scotland). But Scotland still relies very much on fossil fuels.

There is a cost to our landscape and seascape. But, in a climate emergency why is the UK Government developing non-renewable energy sources? And where is the hope for Scots struggling to pay their energy bills when they pay the highest rates in the UK to buy back that same power they see being generated where they live?

He told The Independent: “We currently have government that seems to want to destroy the railway and put it into managed decline, alienate the workforce, drive passengers off it by increasing fares on a regular basis and causing the problems that are currently there. “We find ourselves in a cycle of – I can only say – corruption, really. The government destroying the railway. The government’s caused this, the government can solve it.” The Department for Transport (DfT) rejected the comments, saying that the transport secretary Mark Harper and rail minister Huw Merriman had been talking to union leaders about their desire for a thriving railway. A spokesperson for the DfT said: “The transport secretary and rail minister have held polite, constructive meetings with a range of union leaders since taking office. They have had open and honest conversations about the serious challenges facing the railways. “Passengers have rightly had enough of rail strikes and want the disruption to end. Unions should step back from strike action so we can start 2023 by ending this damaging dispute. “Inflation-matching pay increases for all public sector workers would cost everyone more in the long-term – worsening debt, fuelling inflation, and costing every household an extra £1,000.” When Mr Harper entered office 10 weeks ago, he said his top priority was to end the long and bitter tangle of rail disputes between Network Rail, the train operators and the unions. Another two-day RMT strike begins at midnight, causing the cancellation of four out of five trains across Great Britain and disrupting services until Sunday. Network Rail says footfall at its 20 managed stations on Tuesday morning – the first day of this week’s RMT walkouts – was down by five-sixths on normal levels.",Government seeking to ‘destroy the railway’ says train drivers’ union boss,https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/government-rail-train-driver-union-strike-b2256387.html

The events were created by Developing the Young Workforce (DYW) Inverness & Central Highland, in collaboration with the UHI Inverness college and Skills Development Scotland. They gave S2-S4 Inverness school pupils the opportunity to engage directly with NHS Highland workers and other employers, in a bid to help them make better informed decisions about their future careers. NHS Highland hosted stalls centred around a range of different professions under the health and care umbrella including healthcare science, medical, nursing, dental, midwifery, pharmacy, and adult social care. At each stall teams carried out different interactive “hands-on” activities with young people to provide some experience and educate them about the different services and job roles. Activities showcased included basic life support, clinical skills demonstrations, birthing activities, mental health awareness and dementia awareness with insights into the challenges posed for older adults, and much more. Lori Pattinson, workforce planning manager for NHS Highland was delighted. “We were so excited for our employees to have the chance to meet and engage with young people in order to inspire and inform them about future career opportunities in health and social care within NHS Highland,” she said. “We hope we’ve been able to encourage these young people to pursue a career in health or social care, and become a part of our future workforce.” Three events held at Inverness Royal Academy, Culloden Balloch Baptist Church and Millburn Academy, attracted about 1500 young people to meet with local employers and key sectors most important to the Highland economy, including construction, engineering, hospitality, retail and STEM, as well as health and social care.

Train drivers who are members of the Aslef union working for 15 different companies have walked out for 24 hours, leaving very few trains between England and Scotland running. Among the operators that will run no services at all on Thursday are Avanti West Coast, TransPennine Express, East Midlands Railway, Great Northern, London Northwestern, Northern, Southeastern, Southern, ThamesLink, West Midlands and CrossCountry. Chiltern Railways will not run any services on either Thursday or Friday, while Southwestern’s Island Line will not run on Thursday. Areas where trains will run on Thursday include: Wales; the Central Belt, Fife and the Borders of Scotland; and parts of the South Western Railway network. Rail links to the UK’s two busiest airports will also be cut, with Gatwick Express and Heathrow Express shutting down. The Stansted Express will run just one train per hour on Thursday. On London North Eastern Railway (LNER), the London King’s Cross to Edinburgh route will operate with just five trains in each direction. It is the sixth Aslef train drivers’ strike since summer 2022, and is bracketed by 48-hour stoppages by the main rail union, the RMT, scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday of this week.

Danske Bank has revised its previous forecast of a 0.5% annual fall in economic activity in 2023 downwards and now expects output to contract by about 1% next year. It believes the retail sector will be worst affected by recession, shrinking by 4.5% in 2023, more than twice a predicted contraction rate of 2.2% for this year. Conor Lambe, Danske Bank chief economist, said: “The UK economy contracted in the third quarter of 2022 and we think that economic activity in Northern Ireland is also likely to have declined. Output is then projected to fall further in the final quarter of the year and through most of next year, with both economies experiencing a period of recession as a number of factors adversely impact activity levels. “Inflation is expected to decline gradually during 2023 but remain elevated and weigh down on household purchasing power. Consumer confidence is also particularly low and monetary policy is tightening. “Looking forward, and while noting the considerable uncertainty around the outlook, we expect annual output in Northern Ireland to decline by around 1% next year.” But the bank has forecast that the economy will have grown by around 4% by the end of this year, reflecting a relative improvement on the Covid-19 pandemic. Businesses and consumers have been hit by rising costs throughout 2022, with inflation prompting the Bank of England to increase interest rates to 3%. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the UK economy shrank by 0.3% over the three months to October, although there was a rebound in October itself. As well as retail, other consumer-facing sectors such as accommodation and food, along with arts, entertainment and recreation, are also predicted to take heavy hits during 2023. Danske Bank forecast declines of nearly 4% for both sectors. And output for manufacturing companies is also expected to shrink next year, with a 1.1% fall in output, while the construction sector is tipped for a similar rate of contraction. However, slight growth is predicted for the world of information and communication, as well as scientific and technical services. And education and administrative and support services are also predicted to avoid decline.",Northern Ireland facing continued recession in 2023,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/ulsterbusiness/news/northern-ireland-facing-continued-recession-in-2023-42264137.html

It also costs those striking at a time when family budgets are tight.“As well as protecting the freedom to strike, the Government must also protect life and livelihoods. While we hope that voluntary agreements can continue to be made in most cases, introducing minimum safety levels – the minimum levels of service we expect to be provided – will restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption.” The Government said it will invite unions to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about what is fair and affordable in public sector pay settlements for 2023/24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged industrial action.A statement said: “Ministers are reaching out to unions to invite them to sit down and discuss the evidence that the Government will be submitting to the pay review bodies – and hopes that unions will also share their evidence.“If the offer is accepted, discussions will take place between government departments and unions in the coming weeks on issues including pay evidence, workload and conditions in the public sector.“These discussions will help ensure the evidence submitted to the pay review bodies is as considered and informed as possible, including reflecting areas of common ground.“The Government is clear that the well-established independent pay review process is the right way to set public sector pay – it provides independent, expert advice and is a neutral process in which all parties play a role. “These new discussions would feed into this process and are offered as the Government recognises the particular economic challenges the country faces this year.”The Government called on the unions to cancel upcoming strikes in a bid to resolve the disputes “constructively through dialogue”.“However, the Government also has a duty to the public to ensure their safety, protect their access to vital public services, and help them go about their daily lives,” the statement said.“The Government will always protect the ability to strike, but it must be balanced with the public’s right to life and livelihoods.“That’s why the Government will introduce new laws to ensure a basic level of service in some of our most crucial sectors when industrial action takes place.”Gary Smith, GMB general secretary, said: “A Government that has presided over 13 years of failure in our public services is now seeking to scapegoat the NHS staff and ambulance workers who do so much to care for the people of our country.“The NHS can only function with the goodwill of its incredible staff and attacking their fundamental right to take action will alienate them even further and do nothing to help patients and the public.“We are always ready to discuss our members’ pay but the Government is refusing to talk about problems as they exist now, instead they want to kick the can down the road.“There are huge questions over the NHS Pay Review Body, as ministers’ actions have consistently undermined its independence.

Children in years 1, 2 and 3, between the ages of five and eight, will be given age-appropriate lessons designed to introduce them to different careers, training and skills, and inspire them about the world of work. The £2.6m initiative will be introduced across 55 education investment areas, or “cold spots”, where school outcomes are the weakest, targeting 600,000 pupils in more than 2,200 primary schools. Pupils will get the chance to meet employers and “role models” from a range of industries, to try to raise aspirations and link learning to future jobs and careers they may pursue. They will be introduced to careers in the green economy, technology, engineering, construction, Stem, creative industries, aerospace, hospitality and healthcare. The Department for Education (DfE) said evidence had shown that children started to form ideas about their future when they began primary school, yet most careers guidance took place in secondary schools. In addition to the primary careers programme, the DfE also gave details of a new requirement for secondary school pupils to be given greater exposure to providers of technical education, so they know about alternatives to a traditional academic route. Under legislation that came into force at the start of the year, schools will be required to give all pupils in years 8 to 13 at least six opportunities to meet a range of providers of technical education, including apprenticeships, T-levels and higher technical qualifications. Robert Halfon, the minister for skills, apprenticeships and higher education, said good careers advice was vital to open up opportunities for young people from all backgrounds and create the future workforce the UK needed. “The changes we are making to boost our careers programme will raise ambitions from an early age for thousands of children in primary schools across the country, while providing opportunities to unlock talent, think about skills, engage with employers and discover different workplaces.” Oli de Botton, a former headteacher who is chief executive of the Careers & Enterprise Company, which will coordinate the primary careers programme, said: “Our new primary programme will bring careers inspiration to children early in their school life by connecting them with role models and showing them how different subjects relate to jobs.” The education charity Teach First will help train primary school teachers in disadvantaged areas where the scheme will be introduced. Dominic Wyse, a professor of early childhood and primary education at University College London’s Institute of Education, said the initiative’s success would depend on how well it was delivered. “It does worry me it could be terribly dull. There’s a real question – will it motivate children, will it motivate teachers, and is it the sort of push that’s needed right now?” Sarah Hannafin, a senior policy adviser for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), whose members mainly work in the primary sector, said it was right that careers education should not be left to secondary schools. However, she added: “All schools must be provided with the resources they need to provide high-quality careers education, but current provision remains underfunded. Schools will find it challenging to meet increasing requirements and expectations with no additional resources to deliver them.”",Children as young as five in England target of new careers programme,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jan/05/children-young-five-england-urged-think-about-careers

RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: “Curtailing workers’ freedom to participate in lawful industrial action is always undemocratic and we will look closely at what the Government releases. “We will meet with ministers to see their evidence for the pay process. However, only negotiations on our dispute can avert the planned action this month and I urge the Prime Minister to show a renewed sense of urgency, grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses without further delay. “As for minimum staffing, last month’s action was safe for patients because of detailed discussions we chose to initiate with the NHS to protect emergency services and life-saving care. The public respected that and even ministers acknowledged our constructive approach. “Safe staffing levels that are set in law are what we want to see year-round not just in these extreme circumstances. “We’ve long campaigned for governments to be accountable for safe and effective staffing levels in NHS and social care to prevent one nurse being left with 15, 20 or even 25 sick patients. “The evidence is unequivocal – safe staffing saves lives and having the right number of registered nurses on duty has a direct impact on the safety and quality of patient care. Today’s highly unsafe situation is what is driving our members to say ‘enough is enough’.” Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect said: “This hollow invitation ignores the fact that a majority of public sector workers are not covered by a pay review body, including nearly all civil servants. We have been calling for years for this to be rectified, something which the Government has consistently ignored. “These workers have been some of the most harshly treated over the past decade of real-terms pay cuts, and now the Government is signalling its intent to leave them out once again. “Our members have already indicated their willingness to take industrial action and there is nothing in this announcement that will persuade us not to proceed to a formal ballot as planned.” Unison’s assistant general secretary Jon Richards said: “Ministers should focus their time and energy on rebuilding trust and relationships with workers, not silencing and suppressing them. “Minimum staffing levels in the NHS would be welcome by the public and health staff every single day of the week. That could avoid people being left lying in agony on A&E floors or dying in the backs of ambulances. “The NHS is on its knees because of record vacancies. The idea of limiting legal staffing levels to strike days and threatening to sack or fine health workers at such a time shows proper patient care isn’t ministers’ priority. “The Government is picking ill-advised fights with NHS employees and unions to mask years of dismal failure to tackle pay and staffing.” TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: “This is an attack on the right to strike. It’s an attack on working people, and it’s an attack on one of our longstanding British liberties. “It means that when workers democratically vote to strike, they can be forced to work and sacked if they don’t. That’s wrong, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal. “The announcement offers nothing more to help with this year’s pay and the cost-of-living crisis. “The only offer of talks is for next year. But we need to resolve the current disputes and boost the pay of public sector workers now. “The Prime Minister said yesterday his door is always open – if he’s serious, he should prove it. He should take up my offer to get around the table to improve this year’s pay and end the current disputes. “There is a world of difference between promises of jam tomorrow with technical discussions about pay review bodies, and proper negotiations on pay in the here and now. “Our public services are already deep in a staffing crisis. But this Government has gone from clapping key workers to threating them with the sack if they take lawful action for a pay rise. It will only push more people away from essential jobs in public services, harming the whole nation.” Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, said: “Just when you thought the Government could go no lower, ministers say they’re looking to deal with strikes by making them illegal, rather than negotiate with unions. “PCS members are on strike because they cannot afford the cost of living. We view any attempt to outlaw strikes as an attack on the trade union movement and we will resist that at every stage.” Fire Brigades Union general secretary Matt Wrack said: “This is an empty offer from the Tory government, and a meaningless stunt from Grant Shapps. “Firefighters and other key workers are facing a ‘real-terms’ pay cut, against a backdrop of rising food and fuel prices during the cost-of-living crisis. “Nothing in this statement from Grant Shapps seeks to address the ‘in work’ poverty faced by these workers who kept our public services going during the pandemic. “They were the Covid heroes. “This grandstanding from Grant Shapps is badly misjudging the public mood. “The Government should call off all pay cuts and we’ll call off strikes. “Grant Shapps should stop telling workers to accept falling real wages.” Claire Sullivan, director of employer relations and union services at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Imposing new anti-strike legislation in a country which already has some of the most onerous strike laws in Europe is unnecessary, weak and unworkable. “The Government is well aware that the proposed ‘voluntary agreements’ in the NHS are already in place due to health workers’ commitment to providing ‘critical to life’ cover. “The way for the Government to avoid current and future workplace disputes is through ongoing, meaningful dialogue and by working in partnership with trade unions. The CSP and other health unions have been warning of the developing NHS crisis for a decade and calling for urgent pay talks for several months, only to be met repeatedly by a complete block from Government.”",Government pressing ahead with ‘minimum safety levels’ legislation,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/unions-government-grant-shapps-nhs-prime-minister-b2256705.html

The official government forecasts from HM Treasury show a fall in UK economic output (gross domestic product, GDP) of 0.8 per cent in 2023. The Scottish Fiscal Commission are predicting a 1.2 per cent fall in Scottish economic output. There are no official forecasts for the Highland economy but it is very likely that the GDP performance will be even worse, with probably a fall of about 1.5 per cent. The reasons for that include the greater importance of the tourism industry. Inflation in 2023 is forecast to be about five per cent. That implies an annual fall in personal incomes of about 6.5 per cent in the Highlands. That means another substantial reduction in personal spending, which will have serious negative implications for local shops and other businesses. Looking further ahead, 2024 will almost certainly be better but there can be little doubt that 2023 will be another bad year for the local economy. The world economy had a very bad 2022 because of the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and an inflation rate exceeding 10 per cent. The huge increase in oil and gas prices has badly affected the output of many industries and also consumer spending. There is little expectation of an improvement until later in 2023, as the above forecasts show. The Highlands have a diversified economy, dominated by the service sector, including tourism in normal years. The manufacturing sector is relatively small but includes important industries such as offshore oil and gas production, renewable energy, Scotch whisky and fish processing. Public sector employment has held up well, because of the importance of bodies such as the Highland Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, NatureScot and the Crofting Commission. However, all their budgets have been under severe pressure and that will continue during 2023. Tourism is very important for many parts of the Highlands. It had a very bad 2022 and unfortunately there are few signs of a significant improvement in 2023. There were big falls in visitor numbers last year because of the various Covid restrictions, which resulted in similar falls in revenue for local hotels, B&Bs and many local shops. Hopefully there will be a revival during 2023. Some industries have done surprisingly well, such as Scotch whisky. New distilleries and expansions are currently under construction in various parts of the Highlands. It is a very strange time for the energy industry in the Highlands, including offshore oil and gas, wind farms and other renewables. Oil and gas production is declining steadily but the recent huge increases in world oil and gas prices have helped existing fields and will possibly lead to a few new developments, despite environmental opposition. In contrast, there has been disappointing progress with renewable energy developments and there are few reasons to expect 2023 to be better. A few local businesses, notably Global Energy at Nigg, are doing very well from wind farm contracts but the overall growth has been much less than predicted. The fishing industry should have a better year because of recent international agreements on fish catches. It and the local fish farms have also benefitted from the rises in consumer prices. Most other local businesses have been badly affected by the huge rises in energy prices. However, world oil and gas prices have fallen significantly in recent weeks. Consumer confidence is low and I expect that to continue during the first half of 2023 at least. The lower consumer spending will have negative impacts for shops and other service sector businesses. More closures seem inevitable. There can be little doubt that the first half of 2023 will be another bad time for the Highland economy. I hope there will be a big improvement during the second half of the year but the current indications are not promising. Tony Mackay is an Inverness-based economist.

Morris Leslie, the company behind the West Kinfauns plans, won planning permission in principle in August. 2022? The proposal is for a four-star, four-storey hotel as well as holiday lodges, transport museum and shops. Cafes, restaurants, bakeries and a cycle repair shops could also form part of the development, which could create up to 130 full-time jobs. Next steps in Perthshire leisure hub Morris Leslie’s group operations director Graham Ogilvie has revealed the next steps for the development. Reflecting on a year of progress, he said: “2022 has all been about getting the consent. 2023 is working through the consent and splitting the development into different parts. “The lodges will be the first part of the development. We will progress with the applying for detailed consent and then construction will commence. “This is something we will do ourselves. In the past 18 months we have created our first holiday park at Alyth. This would also be done under the Morris Leslie Villages banner. “It will be around 50 lodges on site. This part of the project alone would be an investment of around £10 million.” Hotel operator sought Morris Leslie is best known for hiring construction equipment, but also has auction and property interests. It also has its headquarters on the site it acquired from Edrington in 2019. However, the company is not going to be a hotel operator. Armed with the outline planning permission from Perth and Kinross Council it will be marketing the hotel opportunity. “There have been discussions with operators that are ongoing,” Mr Ogilvie said. “Getting the brand is the easier bit, it’s the funding and development of the construction project where there are negotiations and discussions ongoing. “I’d like to think we’ll have an operator on board in 12 months’ time.” He warns that the quoted £33.8 million cost is likely to be far higher due to inflation. “The build costs from when we started the project to where we are now have moved significantly but room rates for hotels have moved higher as well,” he said. The park and ride facility, museum and retail elements of the project are likely to come at the later stages of the development. Neighbouring the site is a new 15-home development by Ogilvie Homes who won permission on appeal to the Scottish Government. Morris Leslie hopes around 80,000 people a year could be attracted to the site, boosting the local economy by £4m.

Comment No one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are The dysfunctional rail system can only be fixed if rail pensions are also sorted out John Ralfe 6 January 2023 • 9:35am 350,000 people are part of the Railways Pension Scheme Credit: Jacob King/PA Wire New Year, new rail strikes, new chaos for rail passengers. Although unions have been locked in a bitter dispute with government and rail companies for months, over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions, we haven’t heard much about pensions. Perhaps this is because no one wants passengers and taxpayers to know how generous rail pensions really are? Pensions for train operating company staff are still based on final salary, and most still have a retirement age of 60. Even public sector pensions are now based on career average salaries, with a higher retirement age. The average salary for a train driver with 10-20 years experience is reported to be £55,000, so a driver retiring at 60 with 30 years pension would get an average inflation-linked pension of £22,000, plus a £33,000 cash lump sum. Train company accounts show the annual cost of new pension promises is around 60pc of salary – a huge part of overall pay – even after employee contributions. Rail pensions have a unique “cost sharing” arrangement, with all regular and deficit cash contributions split 60/40 between employers and employees, which may explain the reluctance to increase annual cash contributions. Each train operating company is part of the Railways Pension Scheme (RPS), set up at privatisation in 1994. It is an industry-wide scheme with over 100 legally separate sections, including Network Rail, and freight, engineering and maintenance companies. At privatisation, all pensioners and deferred members were transferred to a new section with a “crown guarantee” underwritten by taxpayers. RPS is one of the UK’s largest pension schemes, with £37bn of assets at December 2021, and 350,000 members, including 100,000 current employees. Each RPS section has a three-year valuation but the December 2016 valuation for train operating companies have still not been agreed with the Pensions Regulator, way, way beyond the legal deadline. Although the established rail franchising rules mean train operating companies must pay cash contributions over the life of a franchise, they have no liability for a deficit when the franchise ends. The deficit is simply passed on to the next company taking over the franchise, in a game of pass-the-parcel. If no one is prepared to take on the franchise, it reverts to the Government. The latest accounts for each of the train operating companies show the combined pension deficit is around £8bn. We know the effective re-nationalisation of the train operators in 2020 means all the industry’s annual losses are paid by taxpayers. But re-nationalisation also means taxpayers are on the hook for the pension deficit, which has been hidden from taxpayers. The dysfunctional rail system can only be sorted out if rail pensions are also sorted out. Despite the threat of further strikes, this means closing the expensive and risky defined benefit pension and moving to defined contribution. The good news for rail staff is that some of the cost savings can be used to increase monthly pay. Defined contributions would still leave the £8bn deficit to be paid, partly through higher fares, but with taxpayers left picking up most of the bill.

The British Medical Association (BMA) warned of three days of further disruption for the NHS if health secretary Steve Barclay continues to refuse to negotiate over pay demands. It comes ahead of a ballot opening on 9 January, when 45,000 junior doctors in England will be asked whether they want to strike in the row over pay. The BMA claimed that Mr Barclay was making attempts to find a negotiated settlement impossible by ignoring “all calls and letters” despite the prospect of strike action. “Pay erosion, exhaustion and despair are forcing junior doctors out of the NHS, pushing waiting lists even higher as patients suffer needlessly,” said Dr Vivek Trivedi and Dr Robert Laurenson, co-chairs of the BMA junior doctors committee. They added: “The government’s refusal to address fifteen years of pay erosion has given junior doctors no choice but to ballot for industrial action. If the government won’t fight for our health service, then we will.” The union said successive governments have overseen 15 years of real-term pay cuts for junior doctors, saying it amounted to a “staggering and unjustifiable” 26.1 per cent decline in pay since 2008-09. But the government has awarded only a 2 per cent pay rise for junior doctors, and Mr Barclay has continued to point to the recommendation of the independent pay review body as a reason to avoid negotiations. The BMA said it was “particularly galling” to see Rishi Sunak and his ministers refer to the pay review body. “The reality is that the doctors’ pay review body has been constrained by political interference for more than a decade,” said the union’s co-chairs. The prospect of fresh NHS disruption comes as ambulance staff prepare to walk out on 11 and 23 January, while nurses will strike again for two consecutive days on 18 and 19 January. The government has vowed to press ahead with plans to introduce new legislation to enforce “minimum safety levels” in the NHS and five other key sectors during industrial action. Health unions reacted with fury to the move, saying it would do nothing to resolve the disputes breaking out across the country. The Royal College of Nursing, GMB and Unison – leading the walks-outs planned for nurses and ambulance staff later in January – also vowed to opposed “desperate” anti-strike legislation. The government also urged union leaders to meet for “honest, constructive conversations” about public sector pay settlements for 2023-24, as part of a “reasonable approach” to avoiding prolonged strikes. But unions bosses said ministers must engage on pay demands for the current year, with the GMB health union accusing the government of trying to “kick the can down the road”. The BMA and other health bodies have warned of an “exodus” of NHS staff as industrial dispute rumbles on. Four in ten (40 per cent) of junior doctors plan to leave the health service as soon as they can find another role, a survey carried out by the BMA last month found. Low pay and poor working conditions were the main reasons cited for wanting to leave, with the union warning that the NHS “would not be able to cope” without two-fifths of its junior doctor workforce. It comes after Mr Barclay appeared to blame high numbers of flu, Covid and Strep A cases for the particular pressures the NHS faced over Christmas – a claim refuted by health leaders who pointed to long-term struggles. Dr Vishal Sharma, chair of the BMA’s consultants committee, said the government’s refusal to admit that the NHS is in a state crisis was “simply delusional”.",Junior doctors to vote on plans to hold three-day strike in row over pay,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/junior-doctors-strike-nhs-march-b2256855.html

The latest S&P Global/CIPS construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI), closely watched by the housebuilding sector, scored 48.8 in December, down from 50.4 in November. Any score below 50 indicates that construction sector output has shrunk, and December’s score marks the first contraction since August. It also came in broadly in line with the consensus, with analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics predicting PMI would fall to around 48.5. The sector has suffered the knock-on effects of a slowing housing market, with mortgages becoming more expensive for home buyers resulting in fewer house sales, economists said. Yet construction firms continue to face higher inflation, pushing up the cost of raw materials and transportation, and the looming threat of a recession. As a result, builders are feeling downbeat about the future of their businesses, the survey revealed. December saw confidence among businesses in the outlook for the year drop into negative territory for the first time since the start of the pandemic, and for only the sixth time on record. Dr John Glen, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply (CIPS), said: “The construction sector was stuck in the mud in December with the steepest fall in activity since the beginning of the pandemic in May 2020 and a similarly fast drop in pipelines of new work. “Housebuilding saw a notable change of direction, with a mix of higher inflation for raw materials and transportation and the squeeze on affordability rates for mortgages resulting in fewer house sales.” The commercial sector marked a “bright spot” in the survey, with activity growing fractionally, with a score of 50.3. But it was offset by contractions across the residential and civil engineering sectors in December. Dr Glen added: “Civil engineering, responsible for larger projects, continued to be the weakest performer again, with a sixth month in the doldrums as uncertainty about the UK economy reared its ugly head again and customers hesitated.” Furthermore, the survey suggests that builders are reining back on recruitment amid a hesitancy to spend too much when the future of the economy is uncertain. Employment fell below a score of 50 for the first time since January 2021, with weak sales meaning that vacancies are often not being filled, the survey indicated. Dr Glen said: “Builders are fast running out of the resilient spirit maintained over the last couple of years as the blocks to success piled up and the winter of discontent with high inflation, strikes and shortages continues.” Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The construction sector managed to keep its head above water through the autumn, but now is being dragged down by the recession in the wider economy and the surge in borrowing costs faced by households and businesses.” But he pointed out that a drop in activity in December may have been partially driven by some builders “downing tools” during the week of heavy snow across parts of the UK.",Builders deflated as construction sector shrinks,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/builders-deflated-as-construction-sector-shrinks-b2257249.html

Speaking on a visit to a school in Battersea, south-west London, the Prime Minister said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday.” Pressed whether the talks would include discussions on this year’s pay, the Prime Minister did not rule this out, saying: “What we have said is we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation with all union leaders about what is responsible, what is reasonable, and what is affordable for our country when it comes to pay. “I’m hopeful that those talks can be constructive and we can find a way through this.” Asked whether he could meet the nursing union’s demands “halfway” after it suggested a pay rise of ten per cent rather than nearly double, the PM added: “We have always been clear that we want to have a grown-up, honest conversation, a two way conversation with union leaders.” The Standard understands that the move is a new approach by the Government, with Cabinet ministers, not the PM, meeting the unions that their departments work with, and that the Government aims to talk about pay deals for 2023/24 rather than this year. However, the stand-off between the Government and unions has escalated after ministers proposed bringing in legislation to force some sectors such as health and transport to continue delivering a “minimum service” during industrial action. Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation. Asked a second time whether people could be sacked for not going to work under the new law, the premier said: ""I fully believe in the unions' role in our society and the freedom for them to strike. ""I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption. ""That's why we're going to bring forward new laws, in common with countries like France, Italy, Spain and others, that ensure that we have minimum levels of safety in critical areas like fire, like ambulance, so that even when strikes are going on you know that your health will be protected. ""I think that's entirely reasonable and that's what our new laws will do."" Labour has said it would repeal the “minimum service” laws, if they are passed before the General Election, and if it wins the poll expected next year. Britain is being hit by a wave of strikes including by rail workers, nurses, paramedics, postal workers, border staff and civil servants.","Rishi Sunak invites all union leaders for ‘grown-up, honest’ talks on Monday in bid to end strikes",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/strikes-rishi-sunak-unions-talks-rail-nurses-b1051247.html

The Bill will be introduced in Parliament in the coming weeks to ensure vital public services maintain a “basic function” when workers go on strike. Minimum safety levels will be set for fire, ambulance and rail services and the Government said it will consult on the “adequate level of coverage”. Speaking from the picket line at Euston station on Friday, Mr Lynch told BBC Breakfast that the Government is trying to “close down” the unions with the new legislation. “What this is a symbol of is that the Government are losing the argument,” he said. “They’ve lost the argument on austerity and pay, and the state of our national public services. “And instead they want to close that argument down by closing down the unions and stopping us from campaigning against poverty.” He said the Bill is a threat to sack union members if they refuse to go to work. “What they are saying is that they will sack our members if they don’t go to work,” he said. “They are going to conscript our members. “We have to name who will go to work, and if those members in a lawful manner don’t want to cross our picket line they can be dismissed individually and the union can be fined. “So we will have to see what the law says.” It comes as services have been crippled by the walkout by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) at Network Rail and 14 train operators on Friday. The action will last for 48 hours and follows a stoppage on Thursday by train drivers in the Aslef union which caused widespread disruption. Only around 20% of normal services are running on Friday and trains will finish earlier. The strike ends a week of industrial action on the railways, with the dispute remaining deadlocked. Speaking to broadcasters on a visit to a school in south-west London, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had invited union leaders for what he hopes will be a “grown-up” conversation on Monday about what is affordable. The Prime Minister was asked if proposed legislation could see nurses sacked for striking, and if it was his ambition to go further and make some more strikes in critical services illegal. Mr Sunak said: “Yesterday the Government wrote to all union leaders inviting them in for talks on Monday. “We incredibly value the important work that our public sector workers do, especially our nurses, and we want to have an honest, grown-up conversation about what’s affordable, what’s responsible for the country. “Those invitations have gone out and I’m hopeful that those meetings can happen on Monday so we can have a productive conversation and find a way through this.” Mr Sunak did not rule out people being sacked for not going to work during strikes under the proposed new legislation.

As many projects were pushed back last year, the beginning of 2023 will be marked by a steady pipeline of work. However, this optimism will be short-lived. Recessionary forces will strike and work is expected to tail off at the back end of 2023. No one feels confident. It is a nervous period to operate as a business, and the sector must stay alert. For the housing market, demand is falling amidst the cost of living crisis, job insecurity and the recession. Declining property prices should stabilise by Spring 2023 yet only those not bound to the difficulties of securing a mortgage or with sufficient savings will be able to afford the luxury of entering the property ladder. The government could help stimulate demand in the housing market by introducing a reduced stamp duty rate for first-time buyers and those wanting to downsize to a smaller property. Confidence in the market will return, but it will take time. Ultimately while the best-run construction companies will survive, partly due to their inherent financial strength, others, including good contractors who may be dependent on third parties, will unfortunately fail. The recession and cost of the living crisis will continue to bite hard. The sector must brace itself for a challenging and uncertain 2023.","UK building sector activity falls, as house prices drop again; eurozone inflation down – business live",https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jan/06/uk-house-prices-fall-us-jobs-eurozone-inflation-train-strikes-business-live

In all, occupiers from a wide range of business sectors have taken a combined total of 120,000 sq ft at Malton’s premier employment park. Sean Harrison, managing director of Harrison Developments said: “These new deals are a tremendous vindication of the substantial investment we have made in our park. “More than 350 new and sustainable jobs have been created on site, which makes us very proud. The wide variety of successful businesses here is also an indication of the strength of the economy in the Ryedale area. Bella di Notte (Image: Press release) “We are especially pleased that successful Yorkshire businesses such as Bella di Notte and Dales The Chef’s Choice have moved into larger premises on our park, because they like the location and the ambience so much. We have been delighted to accommodate their needs, as they have outgrown their current buildings. “These are not the easiest of times, as we emerge from a global pandemic into a worrying cost of living crisis, but the current level of activity at our park gives us confidence for the future,” said Mr Harrison. Luke Counter, owner of the multi-award-winning Counter Interiors, which now occupies a new 1,500 sq ft mezzanine showroom, said: “I can’t speak highly enough of the Malton Enterprise Park, which is the perfect base for us. The flexibility of the mezzanine unit which we occupy means that we now have an extensive showroom, storeroom and offices. “We are based in Clifton in York, but quite a few of our customers are from the Malton and Ryedale area, so it made sense for us to open another showroom here. The location, just by the A64, is ideal, with easy access to the rest of the county. The whole park looks magnificent, which creates the perfect atmosphere for businesses here to flourish.” Meanwhile Bella di Notte, the popular women’s fashion retailer, which originally moved to the Malton Enterprise Park four years ago, has recently taken extra space to accommodate its growth.

Just this week, Amazon said it was axing 18,000 workers, or 6% of its office staff, while business software firm Salesforce said it would reduce its workforce by 10%, or roughly 8,000 people. That followed announcements from dozens of other firms including big names such as Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, hardware heavyweight Cisco, and payments firm Stripe. Despite the belt-tightening seen in Silicon Valley, the world's largest economy soldiers on. Employers in the United States added 223,000 jobs in December, according to the latest official figures. Although that was slower than gains seen in 2021, when activity roared back to life after the pandemic, it was still strong by most standards. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, returning to historic lows. The economy is widely predicted to slow in the coming months as rising prices weigh on consumer spending. Firms are also grappling with higher borrowing costs after the US central bank hiked rates rapidly last year. So are the cuts in the tech industry a warning sign for others? ""I don't think people should be worried,"" said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the job site ZipRecruiter. ""What we're seeing right now seems to be... a correction, not the start of an ominous, systematic recession."" Many tech executives making the announcements have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic, when more activity moved online and business boomed. Funding for smaller start-ups has also dried up due to higher interest rates and the sharp downturn in the US stock market in 2022. Big hits some firms have taken from the meltdown in the crypto sector have not helped the mood either. Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at consultancy RSM, said the wave of tech cuts represented a ""necessary and expected"" adjustment after a generation of rapid growth, fuelled in part by low interest rates, which culminated in the pandemic frenzy. ""An era of excess has come to an end,"" he said. ""Firms and individuals should be prepared to reset expectations about growth, employment and investment across what continues to be a very solid industry."" He suggested that tech firms will no longer be insulated from ups and downs in the wider economy, including the expected downturns in Europe and the UK this year. But he added that the job losses should not be ""over-interpreted"", noting that many of the workers affected, at least in the US, appear to be finding new jobs quickly. The latest jobs report from the Labor Department showed that payrolls in the information sector - which includes much of the tech industry - shrank by just 5,000 from November to December. That's despite thousands of job cuts being announced in recent months and compared to a year ago, employment is up. ""It's probably a canary in the coal mine for the global economy more than it is for the American economy,"" he added, noting that many of the tech cuts have hit foreign staff. Last week, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva warned that a third of the world would likely be in recession in 2023. That will hurt tech firms, many of which do big business overseas. But for now, the US labour market has remained unexpectedly resilient, making some hopeful that the country will be able to fend off a harsh downturn, despite the central bank raising interest rates to try to cool the economy and price rises. Nearly every sector in the US economy added jobs last month, with bars and restaurants, health care firms and construction businesses helping to drive the gains. Although job losses are rising - especially in sectors vulnerable to higher interest rates like housing, banking and tech - the figures overall remained near historic lows last year, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which has been tracking such announcements since the 1990s. ""We are seeing the labour market cooling,"" he says. ""It's a slowdown but I don't think I could say at this point whether or not it's a panic situation."" Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, said he worries many of the layoff announcements reflect peer pressure, as executives feel compelled to copy other firms making cuts - even as they continue to churn out healthy profits. If that sentiment spreads, as he expects, it risks turning the forecasts of economic hardship into reality. ""Companies do what other companies do,"" he said. ""This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because if everybody lays somebody off, the unemployment rate will go up and we will in fact have a worse economy.""",Are tech job cuts a warning for the wider economy?,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64189106?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Rebecca Morelle,85546280,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F74F/production/_128211336_virgin-orbit-88.jpg,en,2023-01-07 04:12:22,-0.019,GB,"The first-ever orbital rocket launch from British soil is set to blast off on Monday, marking the start of the UK's race to space. The ambition is to turn the country into a global player in space - from manufacturing satellites, to building rockets and creating new spaceports. But can the UK carve out a place in an increasingly crowded market - and why try to reach for the stars? ""We are the guinea pigs,"" says Melissa Thorpe. ""It is the first time any of us have done this, so it's been quite a learning experience."" Melissa is in charge of Spaceport Cornwall, which is about to attempt its very first foray into space. She's showing me around their base at Newquay Airport. There's all the usual hubbub of activity: passengers arriving, suitcases being loaded, planes being fuelled. But there's also something more surprising on the tarmac: a 21m-long rocket. A team is busy prepping it for the first ever launch from UK soil that will take satellites into orbit around the Earth. But this is a blast off with a difference. There won't be a vertical launch from the ground. Instead, the rocket is fixed underneath the wing of a modified jumbo jet. Once the plane is mid-air, the rocket will be released and fire its engines to head into space. Setting up the UK's first spaceport has taken years and a lot of hard work, plus an entirely new regulatory framework to ensure these launches are safe. The hope is it will make a difference to the local area, one of the poorest in the UK, by bringing in new companies and creating new jobs. ""I think it's the next chapter for Cornwall,"" Melissa says. ""We were at the heart of the Industrial Revolution. We're not new to pioneering technologies."" But there's a wider ambition too. If this succeeds, it should help to position the UK as a leading place for space. However, this isn't the first attempt at creating a British launch industry. A white and red rocket, nicknamed ""the lipstick"", was supposed to be the start of something big for the UK. It blasted off in 1971, sending a satellite into space. The programme was called Black Arrow, and this was the first British-built rocket to deliver a British-built satellite into orbit - although it took off from Australia. But the costs were deemed too high by the government, so that first launch turned out to be the last. The UK's launch industry hit a long pause after this, but another aspect did take off in Britain - satellite building. And this has helped to drive a thriving space sector, which, according to a recent government report, is worth £16.5bn a year to the UK economy and employs nearly 50,000 people. ""We absolutely knock it out of the park when it comes to small satellite manufacture,"" says Dr Alice Bunn, CEO of UKSpace, the trade association of British space companies. Until now, she says, satellites built in the UK have had to be shipped abroad to get into space, but this first launch will change that. And it comes at a time when satellites have become integral to our lives - although Alice says most people are unaware of how dependent we are on this technology. ""Think about satellite navigation systems, environmental monitoring, emergency response - let alone all the telecommunications capability - that we can provide from space. It really is a running thread through our lives,"" she says. And some companies have big plans with this technology. The Cardiff-based company Space Forge thinks a whole host of new materials can be made in orbit. In a cleanroom, one of their small satellites is being painstakingly prepared for its journey. It's one of nine being sent into space by the Cornwall launch. Space Forge describe their shoe box-sized satellites as mini factories. ""In space, with the absence of gravity, you can mix together any different materials you want,"" says Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bacon. ""So if you take the whole periodic table, and start putting things together - like lead, aluminium, rubidium, einsteinium - there are billions of new alloys that you can now make that you couldn't make on Earth."" The new materials could be used in electric vehicles, green technology or computing, he explains. And he thinks there are some big advantages to launching these satellites close to their Welsh base. ''The fact that we can just drive down the road for a couple hours to get to our spaceport is a huge impact,"" Andrew says. But it's not just Cornwall racing to space. Amidst the bleakly beautiful undulating hills and jagged cliffs of the Shetland island of Unst, there's a hive of activity as diggers and dumper trucks come and go. The team here is celebrating because an important milestone has been reached. The concrete is setting on their first launch pad, one of three planned at the site. The SaxaVord Spaceport is being constructed on a peninsula jutting out into the sea, at the northernmost tip of the UK. ""I think the first response from the locals was that maybe it was an April Fool or something like that,"" says Debbie Strang, SaxaVord's chief operating officer. ""And then, as they've seen the progress and the development, there's been real excitement about what we've been doing."" There's a good reason why they've chosen such a remote place, where sheep and Shetland ponies outnumber the inhabitants. ""It's the safety element for us,"" says Debbie. ""What we're doing needs to be as far away as possible from population centres, so that when the rocket leaves, there's no real danger to people nearby."" SaxaVord is aiming for the UK's first vertical rocket launch to take satellites into orbit, with up to 30 launches a year once it's fully up and running. It's not the only spaceport to be based in Scotland. Others are planned in Sutherland in the Highlands and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides. The hope is that these could all boost local economies, and that's especially important in Unst. ""This island's suffered quite badly from depopulation over the last 20 or 30 years,"" explains Scott Hammond, the deputy CEO of SaxaVord. ""There was a small airfield here that used to be the third busiest heliport in the UK. And then they also had an RAF station here. ""When that left, it halved the population of the island and it clearly had a massive economic impact."" He hopes the spaceport could give the island a boost. ""We'll have more and more service jobs, during the fuelling of the rockets, for example, putting the liquid oxygen into the rockets. And those of course, will be highly paid, highly skilled jobs."" But if you're building a launchpad, you also need rockets - and SaxaVord is working with several companies looking to use Unst to blast off. One of these is Skyrora, based in Cumbernauld, just outside of Glasgow. Inside their vast hanger, the team is busy working on different rocket parts, from nose cones, to engines and containers for propellants. The company is making smaller prototypes, before building a larger rocket, Skyrora XL, that they plan to eventually launch from the Shetland Islands. ""You do a full design on paper and then you start building it. You build prototypes, you do tests, you go back to the drawing board and see what needs to be fixed,"" says Ahsan Zaman. He's just finished his aerospace degree, and says the new push for space in the UK is opening up opportunities for science and engineering graduates. He's proud to be working on the project. ""If we're successful, then we'll forever be known as the first people to do it in the UK. So yeah, it is an honour as well as exciting."" While the launch industry is just starting to come together in the UK, it's much better established in other parts of the world. And one company in particular now dominates the market: Elon Musk's SpaceX. With their reusable rockets, the company has massively cut the price of sending satellites into space. Can the raft of small new rocket companies compete? Skyrora's CEO Volodymyr Levykin says he wants his rockets to offer a more bespoke service. ""We want to be like a satellite taxi service,"" he explains. ""To launch whenever the customer wants us to launch and deliver them to an exact position they need to be in orbit."" He thinks because more and more small satellites are being built, the market to launch them will grow - but not every company will make it. ""Some of us, of course, will fail,"" he says. ""But there are some who are believers in this emerging market. And we decided to invest earlier rather than later, to be ready when the market actually will start to boom."" The UK government says it wants to push the space sector, and is investing in research and development. But UKSpace's Alice Bunn says the support needs to be long term. ""You will not become a global space player by investing in research and development alone. There has to be some kind of government commitment to ongoing operational capability."" She says this could mean the government signing up as a customer for launches, for example. ""We need to think a little bit creatively, industry and government working together, just to get us off the ground here."" All eyes are now on Cornwall, waiting for the first UK launch to blast off. It will be just the start for this new industry and there will be many challenges ahead. But as the well-known mantra goes, space is hard - and anyone working in this sector knows this. The hope is that with this high risk, comes the possibility of sky-high rewards. Follow Rebecca on Twitter.

In a sign of the scale of the problems facing the NHS, Rishi Sunak will spend Saturday focusing on how to ease the pressure on frontline services. But Mr Sunak has been warned that the rare weekend meeting is unlikely to reverse the NHS’ fortunes, which have been blamed on “years of inaction”. Senior doctors say the NHS is on a knife edge, with many A&E units struggling to keep up with demand and trusts and ambulance services declaring critical incidents. Discharge rates fell to a new low in England last week, with only a third of those patients ready to be released from hospital actually leaving. Mr Sunak, during a visit to a school on Friday, said he recognised that the NHS was “under enormous pressure”. No 10’s NHS Recovery Forum will see the Prime Minister hold talks with health experts about how to improve performance. Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Treasury minister John Glen, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden and the chief executive officer of NHS England Amanda Pritchard are also set to attend. The focus will be on four crucial issues: social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care, and primary care. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there were “no silver bullets” to solving the crisis currently being experienced at hospitals and other care centres. “This crisis has been a decade or more in the making and we are now paying the high price for years of inaction and managed decline,” said Mr Taylor. “Patients are experiencing delays that we haven’t seen for years. “High levels of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rising Covid levels are exacerbating the problem but the cause is decades of under-investment in staffing, capital and the lack of a long-term solution to the capacity-crunch facing social care. “None of these problems can be solved tomorrow.” The Prime Minister, in his first speech of 2023 on Wednesday, made reducing NHS waiting lists one of his key pledges before the next election, which is due to take place before 2025. Saturday’s Downing Street forum is expected to last most of the day. As well as ministers, attendees will include chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations, local areas and councils from across the country. Clinical experts from Royal Colleges and independent sector organisations working with health and social care services to deliver services for patients are also expected to join the Prime Minister. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “As the Prime Minister made clear this week, easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS is one of his key promises. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting branded the meeting a “talking shop”. The senior Labour figure said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor, a former Labour and Tony Blair aide, agreed with the criticism, saying the investment to improve discharge rates came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. He added: “Indeed, some local systems are still awaiting their allocation. “Any similar funding next year must be provided four to six months in advance so it can genuinely ease winter pressures.” On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet with union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year. However, Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen has told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” over the current settlement to prevent planned strikes. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll, of course, go to the meeting and make the case for nursing in all forums, but it’s sadly not what’s going to prevent strike action that’s planned for 10 days’ time. “I have put out an olive branch to get us to the table, I’m asking the Prime Minister now to meet the RCN halfway. The ball is firmly in the Prime Minister’s court.” A Department of Health and Social Care source said the Health Secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”.",Sunak to hold emergency No 10 talks in bid to ease winter care crisis,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/steve-barclay-matthew-taylor-nhs-wes-streeting-prime-minister-b2257731.html

The prime minister is hosting experts including England’s chief medical officer Professor Sir Chris Whitty and NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard in Downing Street. Labour said the talks, being joined by health secretary Steve Barclay and Treasury minister John Glen, are a “talking shop” and patients “deserve more”. Mr Sunak has been warned that the rare weekend meeting is unlikely to ease the pressure on frontline services, blamed on “years of inaction”. Senior doctors say the NHS is on a knife edge, with many A&E units struggling to keep up with demand and trusts and ambulance services declaring critical incidents. A wave of strikes and high levels of flu and coronavirus are adding to huge pressures in the health service. Discharge rates fell to a new low in England last week, with only a third of patients ready to be released from hospital actually leaving. Sir Chris and Ms Pritchard were seen arriving at No 10 on Saturday morning, with the “NHS Recovery Forum” set to last most of the day. The focus will be on four crucial issues: social care and delayed discharge, urgent and emergency care, elective care and primary care. NHS Confederation chief executive Matthew Taylor said there are “no silver bullets” to solve the crisis after “decades of underinvestment”. “This crisis has been a decade or more in the making and we are now paying the high price for years of inaction and managed decline,” he said. “Patients are experiencing delays that we haven’t seen for years. “High levels of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rising Covid levels are exacerbating the problem but the cause is decades of underinvestment in staffing, capital and the lack of a long-term solution to the capacity crunch facing social care. “None of these problems can be solved tomorrow.” The Prime Minister this week made reducing NHS waiting lists one of his key pledges over the next two years. Attendees at the meeting were to include chief executives and clinical leaders from NHS organisations and councils from across the country, as well as experts from medical royal colleges and independent sector organisations working in health and social care services. A Downing Street spokeswoman said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she said. “We want to correct the unwarranted variation in NHS performance between local areas, because no matter where you live you should be able to access quality healthcare.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: “After 13 years of mismanaging the NHS, this is the equivalent of the arsonists convening a forum with the fire brigade to put out the inferno they started. “Patients deserve more than a talking shop. “Clinical leaders and health experts have been sounding the alarm for months about the crisis the NHS is facing, so why has it taken so long for Rishi Sunak and Steve Barclay to decide to listen to them?” Mr Streeting said the £500 million for delayed discharges promised by the Government is “yet to reach the front line and is now too late to make a difference this winter”. NHS Confederation chief Mr Taylor said the investment came “too late to have maximum impact this winter”. On Monday, Mr Barclay will meet union leaders to discuss NHS pay for the next financial year in talks that are unlikely to avert planned strikes. Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen told the Prime Minister to “grasp the nettle and negotiate with nurses” to prevent industrial action. She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll of course go to the meeting and make the case for nursing in all forums, but it’s sadly not what’s going to prevent strike action that’s planned for 10 days’ time. “I have put out an olive branch to get us to the table, I’m asking the Prime Minister now to meet the RCN halfway.

The prime minister told health and social care leaders during an emergency summit in Downing Street on Saturday that it was a “collective responsibility” to free up hospital beds and slash ambulance waiting times. But Ms Cullen said his pledge will fail unless he gives her members a pay rise. She warned Mr Sunak the public would back nurses over the government if any were sacked as part of a new anti-strike crackdown and claimed the upcoming nurses’ walkout will be the biggest strike of its kind in the world. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Cullen also challenged the “out of touch” prime minister and health secretary Steve Barclay to work a 14-hour shift in a crisis-hit emergency ward. She said Mr Sunak could end the strikes this week if he takes up her offer to meet in the middle on pay, after saying she was willing to discuss a raise of 10 per cent instead of the 19 per cent originally asked for. During the crunch summit to solve the chaos engulfing English hospitals, Mr Sunak warned health leaders “business-as-usual mindset won’t fix the challenges we face”. England’s chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty and NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard were among those summoned for the rare weekend meeting. The prime minister is understood to be looking at ideas including the use of technology to help people stay out of hospital and increasing the number of “virtual wards”. He also highlighted that a small number of NHS trusts were responsible for a large proportion of serious issues, including long ambulance waits and waiting times for cancer care. Downing Street has said it will publish recovery plans to improve ambulance and A&E waiting times “in the coming weeks”. As Mr Sunak battles to bring the current crisis under control, Ms Cullen urged him to understand the scale of the upcoming nurses’ strike. A 48-hour walkout in England from 18 January will involve more hospitals than similar strikes last month’s action. She said: “We balloted around 320,000 nursing staff and my understanding is it has been the largest ballot of nursing staff in the world and it is the largest nursing strike in the world. We’ve also increased the number of organisations [such as NHS Trusts]. There are now 70 involved. First time around it was 46.” She also revealed that she had received messages of support from senior politicians in several European countries. December’s strikes were headline news in France, Italy, Spain and Austria among others. The world was “watching in dismay”, Ms Cullen said. She urged Mr Sunak to learn from the experience of other international leaders who were forced to back down in the face of ward walkouts, including Irish prime ministers in the first decade of this century. “What this government should look to is how the leader of [Ireland] stepped in very quickly and did not allow both of those strikes to go beyond the first few days,” she said. “And took immediate action. And that was because the public pressure was enormous.” On Wednesday, Mr Sunak set out his vision for the NHS, including a personal pledge to cut waiting lists. But he was criticised for offering nothing to end the current crisis or the strikes, which will also see ambulance staff take action later this month. “He made a broad, bold statement that he was going to cut waiting lists, but he won’t unless he addresses the crisis in nursing ... and the only way you are going to do that is to address the fundamental issue of nurses’ pay,” Ms Cullen said. Strike action will have to escalate if the government continues to ignore nurses, she said, although no decisions have yet been taken on what that would look like. Ms Cullen added: “He could bring it to a resolution this coming week – and avert industrial action. I will make myself available any night or any day. Let’s get round a table. Let’s have a discussion. “I think they owe that to the profession, to all those 320,000 nurses. And they owe it to every patient in this country, particularly those 7.2 million sitting on waiting lists year on year, to get around a table.” On Friday Mr Sunak refused to rule out that nurses could be sacked as part of his new crackdown, swerving the question in a broadcast interview. She described “any suggestion that they would sack any nurse… simply because nurses are standing up for their patients and the NHS” as “disheartening” given that there were currently 47,000 vacancies in the UK. Describing the prime minister as “out of touch” with the realities of the current crisis, she challenged Mr Sunak and his health secretary to work a 14-hour shift in an emergency department. She said: “From 7am to late into the evening, when a number of those hours will be unpaid, when the nurses should be off shift and home but they have no one to hand their patients on to. “They need to just walk in the shoes of those nurses for a few of those shifts. And I think that would make better decisions.” Leaving the NHS Recovery Forum on Saturday, consultant physician James Dunbar told reporters he was “confident that action will be taken” to address the crisis – but not optimistic it would be dealt with before spring. “These are difficult problems to fix though, so I think it’s unlikely we’ll have it sorted by the end of this winter,” he said. Dr Dunbar said that “a lot of” senior clinical leaders taking part were “saying the same thing”, adding: “The prime minister seemed to understand that.” Royal College of Emergency Medicine president Adrian Boyle meanwhile said the crisis is “fixable” and welcomed emergency care being “recognised as a priority”. A Downing Street spokesperson said “easing the immediate pressures whilst also focusing on the long-term improvement of the NHS” are among Mr Sunak’s key commitments. “That’s why we’re bringing together the best minds from the health and care sectors to help share knowledge and practical solutions so that we can tackle the most crucial challenges such as delayed discharge and emergency care,” she added. A Department of Health and Social Care source said the health secretary plans to host an “honest and constructive conversation about what is affordable for NHS pay in the coming year”. A government spokesperson said: “The health and social care secretary wants to have an honest conversation with unions, including the RCN, about what is affordable in pay settlements for next year during these challenging times, and is keen to meet for discussions as soon as possible. “We have accepted the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in full and have given over 1 million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. This is on top of a 3 per cent pay increase last year when public sector pay was frozen and wider government support with the cost of living.”",Rishi Sunak warned waiting list pledge will fail without NHS pay rise as he calls for ‘radical’ action,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/pat-cullen-nurses-rcn-strikes-b2257639.html

Here, we speak to just three of them. Volunteers at a vital community foodbank say that demand is surging with low-paid workers increasing reliant on it to make ends meet, writes Russell Blackstock. The facility at St Gregory’s Catholic Church, in Wyndford, Glasgow, is staffed entirely by unpaid helpers and is open five days a week. Unlike other foodbanks, St Gregory’s does not require users to provide a referral from an agency. It distributes free bags comprising up to 20 items including cereal, pasta, canned soup, tuna, tinned fruit, long-life milk and eggs. Toiletries, washing powder and washing-up liquid are also available. Co-ordinator Eileen Low said the number of people seeking help had soared by more than 30% since the pandemic’s peak while in the week before Christmas volunteers distributed a record number of bags. “We have just had our biggest ever week with 219 basic bags being handed out to help more than 500 individuals and families,” she said. “It is a grim new record to end the year with for us.” Low said that the foodbank’s clientele had also changed since the cost of living crisis started to bite this winter and many more working families were now seeking help. “When we started out five years ago, we were distributing between 30 and 40 bags weekly and it was usually to the most vulnerable people such as refugees, single pensioners and those with mental health or addiction issues,” she explained. “But now we are seeing more and more parents who have low-paid jobs such as cleaners and hospitality workers coming to us for help because they can’t pay the bills and feed their kids at the same time. “The working poor is a growing sector in our area and the government seems unable to do something constructive about it, so that’s where community-based charities come in. We are another safety net for people who are struggling financially and the authorities seem happy to let the likes of us pick up the slack. “It is obscene that this is happening in this day in age. At times we feel as though we are providing a new frontline service.” Ingrid Mitchell, who lives locally, has been volunteering at St Gregory’s for the past three years. She helps to shop for staples and hands out and delivers bags to foodbank users. The mother of two is a senior cabin crew member with a large airline, serving meals and drinks to passengers on transatlantic routes. She has been shocked by the surge in families seeking assistance from the foodbank. She said: “Many people feel embarrassed to ask for help but some have no other choice and they now rely on us. I have always been community minded and it is awful to see ordinary people in this situation. Sadly, I can’t see this crisis easing any time soon.” ‘We are warm and can offer a respite to what is going on’ No longer just a place to borrow books or study for exams, libraries are introducing a range of activities, clubs and groups to create “warm and welcoming spaces” that people can utilise during the cost of living crisis, writes Alice Hinds. From movie matinees and craft groups to mindful colouring-in sessions for adults and regular coffee mornings, library leaders say such innovative services provide a vital lifeline for people in the community who would otherwise struggle to find warm, comfortable and, importantly, free places to spend time during winter months. Ray Pattie, library adviser at Edinburgh Central Library, says the centres have always provided support for communities but new groups have become increasingly popular for people who may feel isolated or worried about spending money while socialising. “Our users see libraries as safe and reliable spaces,” he explained. “People just don’t have the disposable income now for sitting in Costa for hours and hours – that can turn into an expensive week, so they are looking for other things to do outside of the home. “That’s why we’re providing things like Knit And Natter, a weekly craft group, and adult colouring-in sessions, too. “The activities give people an opportunity to still come out and spend time with other people in a warm space but it’s more affordable than visiting a cafe. It’s an opportunity to meet new people as well. Since I’ve worked in libraries, it has very much been all about the community.” As well as introducing social groups, many of the Scottish capital’s libraries have also added social spaces to encourage people to visit for as long as they like. Replicating a living room with plants, comfortable seating, warm lighting and coffee tables, the areas also have free-to-use jigsaws and board games and a number of libraries have also included self-help guides on topics such as energy and money saving, and cooking on a budget. Hana Mackechnie, lifelong learning service manager for libraries in Edinburgh, said: “Some of our libraries are open 52 hours a week and you don’t need to come for a particular reason. “We’re finding that people want a space where they can spend a little bit longer, and somewhere they can also find signposting to benefits they might be entitled to, or get advice on how to access particular services. If you are a reader, you probably already feel like you’re welcome in a library but there’s so much more going on and we’re trying to introduce more activities.” Every weekday during winter, libraries across Edinburgh are also hosting movie matinees with free teas, coffees and refreshments, giving people another way to keep warm for a few hours. Acting library supervisor Natasha Gibson added: “We were already providing or about to introduce these initiatives but the situation now has brought more of a need for them and highlighted just how valuable they are for the community. “People are becoming more aware that, yes, libraries are also a place to come and be social and have a few minutes of respite from whatever is going on in life. “People do come to the library specifically to chat to people or get a change of scenery and at the moment it’s a much-needed place away from home that’s warm – both in terms of the physical surroundings and the people that are here.” ‘It is sad to see so many people struggling’ Demand for free furniture, school uniforms and even haircuts is on the rise at a community-based initiative in south-west Scotland, writes Russell Blackstock. The Furniture Project in Stranraer was originally set up to recycle, repair and provide refurbished household goods at affordable prices. But the charity, which has more than 20 volunteers and runs two shops, has also turned to providing household items and services for free to families struggling with the cost of living crisis. “We started running Freebie Friday events that are proving to be hugely popular,” said boss Paul Smith. “These include giving away items like furniture and household appliances and demand has been high. “So many low-income workers who wouldn’t normally be struggling are now coming to us because the price of everything has risen so much that they simply can’t make ends meet. “I suppose we are doing what the likes of parish organisations and local authorities might have done in the past.” Other popular services provided by the charity include organising free school uniforms and haircuts for children whose parents are struggling to get by. “A new school blazer alone can cost between £40 and £50 and if you have three kids in the house, that is a big expense for any family,” said Smith. “People can come to our shop and discreetly get a school uniform for nothing, and we run this service all through the school year. We have also started a project involving local hairdressers so that kids can get haircuts for free because, again, this can be expensive if you have a number of children in the house. “We try to help to make sure that these kids don’t feel any different from friends at school who come from better-off backgrounds. “It is sad to see so many people struggling financially at the moment but I grew up on a housing scheme that was regarded as being poor and we had to put up with hand-me-downs, so I know what that is like.” The organisation also recycles bicycles and gifts that would usually go to landfill, and sells them cheaply to people once they have been refurbished. Also, it provides a mentoring service that enables retired people to pass on skills and knowledge to youngsters so that they can find jobs in areas such as warehousing and customer services. Smith said even middle-income families were now using the project to inexpensively replace big-ticket household items such as fridges, cookers and furniture as the cost of living crisis deepens. He added: “Previously, you could almost categorise those using services like ours as being among the most vulnerable in our community but the financial pressures are now adding up for people right across the board. “We are now increasingly helping the sort of folk that we normally wouldn’t expect to see.”","Community foodbank: In this day and age, it is obscene we are so needed as a safety net for people",https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/foodbanks-warmbanks/

Being the prime minister, he must have thought, has to amount to more than acknowledging a terrifying array of looming crises. When asked what you hope to do with your time in office, you’ve got to give a more inspiring answer than “cope”, even if you’re fortunate in following a leader who didn’t even manage that. What would be a clear, constructive, positive, yet achievable, initiative? Nothing fun at this bleak time – any whiff of levity could be accused of trivialising people’s suffering. And nothing that sounds expensive. Also nothing that sounds too leftwing, what with the Tory right calling Sunak a socialist for failing to cut taxes. But nothing that sounds too rightwing either, what with the Labour party being so far ahead in the polls. Plus there are many subject areas to avoid: health, transport, defence, the economy… Probably best if it doesn’t touch on any other countries, what with Brexit being such a sore point and China getting horribler and Russia obviously. And there’s the whole illegal immigration shitstorm, so maybe steer clear of abroad altogether. Also food and fuel and housing would be good areas not to mention. Plus it shouldn’t be something that sounds difficult or people won’t believe it’s going to happen. And it shouldn’t be anything that anyone cares too much about because, its achievability notwithstanding, it still probably won’t happen. What should it be? I’d have been stumped. My best idea was: “Every hard-working family will be given a free cactus.” They could sit on kitchen tables, as symbols of bristly resilience, while people try to work out how to pay the mortgages on their freezing homes. Little green shoots of spiny recovery sprouting all over an economic wasteland. Sunak went another way. He fell back on something he could rely on, the solace of many a swot in the face of moral complexity, myself included: maths. You know where you are with maths. Maths doesn’t let you down. Maths doesn’t go on strike, or arrive uninvited on the south coast, or die because it couldn’t get an ambulance, or send bullying texts, or appear on I’m a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!. Let’s do more maths! That was his new initiative. Everyone should be studying maths until the age of 18, he declared. Who can argue with that? Eight million adults in the UK are only numerate to primary school level. That’s bad. But brilliantly, all those potential voters, who presumably hate maths, won’t have to do any at all, but only agree with the principle that they should have done more previously. No one who can vote will have to do anything they don’t want to. This is an entirely inoffensive policy. The education secretary, who my investigations tell me is called Gillian Keegan, might feel aggrieved that it doesn’t leave her with much to say in her next speech. Michael Gove used to have great fun with that brief – handing out bibles and making everyone read Thomas Hardy and memorise dates – and even Gavin Williamson got to cancel everyone’s exams. The importance of maths should be something Keegan gets to bang on about to easy applause, but the PM has nicked it because every single other policy area has gone toxic. But he was determined to make it sound massive: “This is personal for me,” it was reported that he was “expected to say” in his speech. And he did! “It’s the single most important reason why I came into politics: to give every child the highest possible standard of education.” Wow – it turns out he’s a stealth educationist. He was also expected to say: “Just half of all 16-19-year-olds study any maths at all. Yet in a world where data is everywhere and statistics underpin every job, our children’s jobs will require more analytical skills than ever before. And letting our children out into the world without those skills is letting our children down.” Admirable sentiments, though the phrase “our children’s jobs” raises the spectre of child labour. An unfortunate slip when families are struggling to afford food and fuel and the sick are left untreated. It’s all getting a bit Dickensian. But perhaps it’s deliberate. Is this heritage austerity? Back to when Britain was great? Perhaps by “studying maths” he means “doing data entry”? Good work for children with their nimble fingers, and much safer than picking fluff out of an industrial loom, so we must count our blessings. It was a slip because, of all the things he was “expected to say”, the phrase about “children’s jobs” was the only one he didn’t. Very wise. Bless him, he just wanted to say “children” as many times as possible. A focus group must have generated that finding: saying “children” is a good look for him. Better than for Truss the malfunctioning robot or Johnson the philanderer, who just kept having children. Sunak’s children look nice – he’s shared some lovely photos – it’s a relatable family unit. Keep saying “children”, Rishi, and people will believe you care. I approve of the maths plan, but it’s such a tiny thought. In most countries that we increasingly laughably consider our equivalents, maths up to the age of 18 has long been compulsory. Rather than having an idea, he’s just picked one of myriad ways in which Britain is worse than elsewhere and resolved to correct it. It’s like saying: “We really ought to start brushing our teeth.” A small, long-overdue correction to our educational practices coming from the leader of a party that’s been in power for 12 years. It’s lame. And it won’t happen. Sunak says he “will work with the sector to move towards all children studying some form of maths to 18”. “Work with” to “move towards”. Christ. Don’t hold your breath. As Keegan’s shadow, Bridget Phillipson, put it: “He cannot deliver this reheated, empty pledge without more maths teachers, yet the government has missed their target for new maths teachers year after year.” More teachers requires more money. The money must either be raised or moved from elsewhere. That means fewer missiles or nurses or tax cuts or more taxes. Perhaps maths will let him down after all.",More maths?

Last year was chaotic for domestic politics, with upheaval at Westminster and long-running argument at Holyrood on the constitution. Here are just five of the big problems and promises you want sorted for 2023. 1. Fix the NHS NHS Grampian took the desperate step of putting out an urgent social media appeal for staff off-duty or on holiday to come in to work over the festive period. And NHS Highland has warned Raigmore and Belford Hospitals are “very busy” and expressed concerns over a surge in flu patients. Patients across the north and north-east have also struggled to access their GP with one Aberdeen doctor revealing he is seeing three times the safe number of patients “on an almost-daily basis”. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf is facing mounting pressure to come forward with a recovery plan. He says Covid backlogs, rising cases of flu and Strep A, delayed discharged and cold weather are “all compounding” the usual pressures on the health service. The SNP minister is expected to deliver a statement addressing concerns at Holyrood on Tuesday. Meanwhile, NHS Grampian is waiting for an extra £7 million a year required to help more Moray women give birth in Elgin. Campaigners in Caithness continue to raise concerns over the lack of women’s healthcare in the county, with women facing 100-mile journeys to Inverness for treatment. 2. Will the A9 and A96 be dualled? It was confirmed just days before Christmas that a final decision on fully dualling the A96 between Aberdeen and Inverness will not be made until well into next year. The SNP promised over a decade ago to dual the route by 2030. But this was thrown into doubt when the Scottish Greens were brought into government in 2021. An open survey of P&J readers, published on January 6, revealed the vast majority of respondents want the A96 dualled all the way. A project to dual the A9 between Inverness and Perth has also been hit by serious delays but the government has yet to give an update on its 2025 target completion date. Pressure on the SNP Government is intensifying after 13 people died on the stretch due to be dualled between the two cities. 3. We need better ferries Furious islanders from the Hebrides to Shetland have warned locals are packing up and quitting their communities in response to the “utterly chaotic” ferry system. The construction of two new ferries, MV Glen Sannox and Hull 802, is well behind schedule and over budget. The vessels, which were originally commissioned in 2015 from struggling shipyard Fergus Marine, are now years late and over a hundred million pounds over budget. The Holyrood inquiry continues but already the SNP is promising more. 4. Whatever happened to Freeports? Three locations across the north-east, Highlands and islands are vying for “green freeport” status from the UK and Scottish governments. Freeports get special tax status and are being promoted as job-creating goldmines. Others fear they are light on regulation and attractive to money launderers. A joint bid by Aberdeen and Peterhead ports is going up against bids by Cromarty Firth and Orkney for the two coveted spots. But bidders have been left in the dark since the summer over who will secure the special tax status, with Scottish Secretary Alister Jack admitting months ago that a decision has already been made. It is understood the ever-changing leadership of the Tory party delayed the announcement last year. 5. What is the future for oil and gas? The SNP conference in October seemed to finally push the future of oil and gas workers to the top of the agenda. Taking place in Aberdeen, Ms Sturgeon said her government has a “duty” to support workers into new green jobs. But there has been a lack of detail on the practicalities. Energy Secretary Michael Matheson is slated to deliver a statement on Scotland’s long-awaited energy strategy and “just transition” plan on Tuesday. The latter will focus on the offshore workforce, Mr Matheson told the Press and Journal last year. Energy policy is reserved to the UK Government and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will have a key role in charting the future of the oil and gas sector, from the licensing of future oil fields to the windfall tax.",5 problems people across the north of Scotland want politicians to fix in 2023,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/5243446/nhs-freeports-a9-a96-oil-gas-ferries/

The deck machinery specialist – based at Towie Barclay Works, near Turriff – is enjoying growth in the offshore floating wind market. Our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Alfie Cheyne, founder and chairman, Ace Winches. Growing demand in energy markets in both North America and the Middle East are also driving the business forward, it said. Ace Winches, whose many accolades over the years include prestigious Queen’s Awards in 2010 and 2013, has formed a subsidiary in the United Arab Emirates as part of its global growth strategy. And earlier this year it announced the opening of a subsidiary in Houston, Texas. Underlying earnings up 38% Chairman Alfie Cheyne said a strong financial performance during the 12 months to March 31 last year was a foundation “which bodes well for the future”. The company reported pre-tax profits of £4.5 million – down from £7.8m for the previous year, when results were boosted by the reversal of a £4.8m write-down. Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation raced ahead to £7.6m last year, up by 38% from £5.5m previously. Ownership tussle The most recent figure excludes one-off costs associated with a change of ownership, Turnover increased slightly to £28.3m, up from just shy of £28m the year before. Ace Winches’ 58-year-old chairman founded the business in 1992 but lost control of it to Balmoral Group in stages between 2017 and 2019. The relationship with Aberdeen-based Balmoral eventually turned sour and Mr Cheyne and his wife, Valerie, reacquired the firm in late 2021. Reflecting on 2021-22, Mr Cheyne said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone. “It has been a strong performance which bodes well for the future. “We have continued to invest in the business and the people that make it as successful as it is.” He added: “In this reporting period we have made an additional investment of £1.3m in our rental fleet in line with our twin objectives of diversification and geographic expansion. “It has been a year marked by significant growth and change – growth in the renewables market and a change in how we interact with our customers. “This provides an exciting challenge that we are able to meet, thanks to our specialist rental fleet and expertise in traditional energy, as well as in renewable energy construction and installation. “We have seen an increasing demand for offshore floating wind in different regions globally, and our ability to harness the potential that brings for ourselves and clients can only lead to further success.” Green ambitions Mr Cheyne also highlighted the firm’s green credentials after it became carbon neutral. Operations at Towie Barclay Works are now powered by wind. On the firm’s wider green ambitions, chief commercial officer Gary Wilson said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East are indicators of our strategy going forward.” With more than 3,000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, Ace Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and other services in multiple sectors. Headcount averaged 155 during the 12 months to March 2022, down from 171 the year before. Mrs Cheyne, chief compliance officer, said the company was growing its workforce again. She added: “We have reintroduced our very successful craft and modern apprenticeship schemes and further increased our graduate engineer numbers, providing significant opportunities in energy engineering for fresh, quality talent across the north-east of Scotland and beyond.”",Ace Winches sets sights on global growth after &#8216;strong&#8217; results,https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/local/5245423/ace-winches-sets-sights-on-global-growth-after-strong-results/

Earlier, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “happy to talk about pay” with unions as ministers held a series of meetings aimed at ending a wave of industrial unrest in the NHS and on the rail network. However, both the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Health Secretary Steve Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” Unite said any suggestion that a one-off pay reward could be made in exchange for a boost in productivity was “absolutely ludicrous”. While other trade unions said that “progress” had been made, there was no sign that enough had been made for planned strikes to be called off. Unite negotiator Onay Kasab, speaking after a meeting with Mr Barclay, accused the Government of telling staff they would need to “justify” a payment through productivity. “This isn’t a factory we’re talking about, we’re talking about people who are working well beyond their contracted hours anyway just to get the job done because they care so much. “So, for the Government to be talking about productivity in exchange for a (payment) is an insult to every single one of our members.” Mr Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. Alongside talks with health unions, teaching unions were holding talks with Education Secretary Gillian Keegan ahead of announcements this week over whether their members will go on strike. Rail minister Huw Merriman called in train workers after sustained action crippled services, with only one in five trains running between Tuesday and Saturday. Mr Kasab said: “I emphasise the thing to get out of today that is absolutely clear is that they want our members to give more in order for it to consider a payment. That is absolutely outrageous.” He said there had been no “detailed” discussion of what a pay settlement might look like, adding that the talks had left him “very angry”. He added: “The Government have missed yet another opportunity. We came here in good faith.” After the meeting, the GMB said that ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday, adding that the talks “fell well short” of anything needed to stop the walk-out. More than 10,000 GMB members are expected by the trade union to take to picket lines on Wednesday. “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis,” said Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary. “The public expects the Government to treat these talks seriously – it’s time they got on with it.” Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, told reporters that “progress” had been made but said there had been no “tangible” concessions. “It was a very civil meeting. We did actually manage to talk about pay – we didn’t get the tangible concessions that we might have hoped for that would enable us to call off the strikes later this week. “But it was definitely progress when you’re in a room with the Secretary of State talking about pay, I think. “He’s asked for our help to help with the Treasury to make the case for investment. We’ll certainly do that.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks. Elaine Sparkes, assistant director at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: “Although the meeting was more constructive this time, there is nothing tangible on the table. “As such, we’ll be announcing the first of our strike dates later this week as we continue to push for a fairer deal for our members and their colleagues.” The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement. On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”. “On pay, we’ve always said that the Government is happy to talk about pay demands and pay issues that are anchored in what’s reasonable, what’s responsible, what’s affordable for the country.” Downing Street earlier warned that concerns about inflation had not gone away as the Government prepares for the next round of pay talks for 2023/24. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the Government was open to listening to trade unions’ concerns. “We are happy to listen to the pressures they think they are under, what they think is fair, responsible and affordable, and likewise we will provide detail about what we think is affordable, and also the challenge that inflation poses to all of this as well.” Elsewhere, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch dodged questions about progress in rail talks but said that further discussions would take place. Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers’ union Aslef, gave a shrugging gesture as he left the Department for Transport but also declined to give any detail of the meeting. The National Education Union said that “no concrete progress” had been made in its talks with the education secretary. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “While there is the thought of further meetings, there is no sense of concrete progress as yet. There is no offer, there is no change. “There are further discussions to happen that we will engage in while still urging our members to vote in the ballot.” Mr Courtney added: “There is nothing so far that would dissuade us from taking industrial action because we think these meetings are only happening because of the threat of industrial action.” Business Secretary Grant Shapps has said ministers were seeking a more “collaborative approach”, telling BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: “It is a new year. We are very keen to see these strikes come to a conclusion. We want to see a collaborative approach.”",Strikes set to go ahead after ‘insulting’ talks with Health Secretary,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/strikes-set-to-go-ahead-after-insulting-talks-with-health-secretary-b2258736.html

The company, which earlier this year announced the opening of ACE Winches Inc. in Houston, Texas, reported a pre-tax profit of £4.5m, while there was also a slight increase in turnover to £28.3m. ACE Winches Chairman Alfie Cheyne, who, in 2021, returned to the organisation he founded, said the performance gives the company a strong platform to build from. He said: “We are pleased with how the business has performed in what, once again, have been challenging circumstances for everyone.

As part of that ambition, ACE has formed a subsidiary company in the United Arab Emirates, ensuring the range of high-quality services from concept design through to manufacture, equipment rental and further support, is delivered globally. Chief Commercial Officer Gary Wilson​ said: “Our continued growth in the renewables energy sector, along with the opening of our Houston facility and expansion into the Middle East, are indicators of our strategy going forward, as we place a focus on areas of opportunity where our capabilities and solutions single us out as a contractor of choice. “We have a strong reputation that has been built up through our commitment to innovation and investing in our people and services over the last 30 years, and we are looking forward to bringing that expertise to more of our customers in North America and the Middle East, as well as markets we already serve.” With more than 3000 rental assets, a training academy and purpose-built facilities in the UK and Norway, ACE Winches is a global leader in lifting, pulling and deploying solutions across multiple sectors.

The Jamesfield development is a joint venture with Harmony Energy, following TagEnergy’s acquisition of a 60% stake in the project in November 2021. It will use a system of Tesla Megapack lithium-ion batteries, together with Tesla’s Autobidder software for real-time trading and control. It is expected to be operational in the fourth quarter this year, with renewable energy company RES as asset manager. Franck Woitiez, chief executive of TagEnergy, said the company's third battery energy storage facility in the UK reinforced its commitment to the country and its green energy goals. “This is another important milestone in TagEnergy’s growth in the UK as we leverage our strong storage expertise to support the UK grid and propel the nation to net-zero carbon emissions by connecting more competitive renewable power. “We are excited to enter this next phase in the project in partnership with Harmony Energy and with the support of Santander UK as we grow our UK footprint to accelerate the energy transition.” Mark Cumbo, director of specialised and project finance at Santander UK, said: “This follows the funding we provided TagEnergy in 2021 to support Hawkers Hill Energy Park in Dorset, and to TagEnergy and Harmony Energy in 2022 for Chapel Farm near Luton. “Santander UK strongly supports clients such as TagEnergy and Harmony Energy that are bringing additional capacity to enable greater contribution from renewables to the UK’s energy sector.” Peter Kavanagh, chief executive of Harmony Energy, said: “We have been working on this site for over four years and are delighted to be progressing to this next stage with TagEnergy, following our partnership which was announced in 2021. “Securing debt funding from Santander UK demonstrates a growing appetite from institutions to support battery developments and we look forward to working with it.” Jamesfield is the third TagEnergy investment in battery storage facilities in the UK to reach financial close following its entry into the UK market in 2021. Commissioning of its first project, Hawkers Hill Energy Park, took place in September and construction of its second project, Chapel Farm, started last February. Jamesfield, Chapel Farm and Hawkers Hill, together with previously-announced projects Roaring Hill in Fife, Lakeside in North Yorkshire and more recently, Pitkevy in Scotland, take TagEnergy’s secured portfolio in the UK to date to 320MW/640MWh. TagEnergy partnered with Balance Power in October to build, own, and operate 500MW of Balance Power’s renewable energy pipeline requiring an investment of more than £300m over the next four years. Since its formation in 2019, TagEnergy has assembled a portfolio of close to 4GW based on solar, wind and battery storage technologies in the UK, Portugal, Spain, France and Australia.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Mr Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. The Health Secretary suggested that improvements in efficiency and productivity could “unlock additional funding” for the 2023/24 pay settlement, but unions want workers paid more now, raising the possibility of a one-off lump sum to help with the soaring cost of living. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down.

The source said talk about productivity and efficiency improvements had been linked to the 2023/24 pay settlement, rather than a one-off payment. In the Commons, Mr Barclay told MPs: “It is right that we are engaging with the trade unions, I was pleased to meet the staff council of the NHS today and indeed the chair of the NHS Staff Council, Sara Gorton, said the discussions had made progress. “Notwithstanding one trade union leader who wasn’t in the talks giving an interview outside the department to comment on what had and had not been said in those talks, but we want to work constructively with the trade unions on that.” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had earlier not denied suggestions the Government was considering a one-off payment to help NHS staff deal with the soaring cost of living, but said any pay settlement would have to be affordable and not further increase inflation. An ally of Mr Barclay said the issue of a one-off payment was raised at the meeting by the unions, rather than the Health Secretary, who “listened to what he had to say and agreed to take it away”. The Government had previously refused to discuss wages for nurses and other public-sector workers, insisting those were matters for the independent pay review bodies, but over the weekend Mr Sunak hinted at movement. On Monday, Mr Sunak declined to get into the “specifics” of the Government’s approach but said that he was “really pleased that union leaders accepted ministers’ invitations to come in today to have discussions across the board and that’s a really positive development”.

Talks between NHS unions and Health Secretary Steve Barclay were branded “bitterly disappointing” and an “insult”, while education unions warned Gillian Keegan it was “now or never” to prevent teachers going on strike. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Unite criticised the meeting with Mr Barclay, accusing ministers of “intransigence”. The Health Secretary suggested that improvements in efficiency and productivity could “unlock additional funding” for the 2023/24 pay settlement, but unions want workers paid more now, raising the possibility of a one-off lump sum to help with the soaring cost of living. Joanne Galbraith-Marten, director of employment relations and legal services at the RCN, said in a statement: “There is no resolution to our dispute yet in sight. “Today’s meeting was bitterly disappointing – nothing for the current year and repeating that ‘the budget is already set’ for next year. “This intransigence is letting patients down. Ministers have a distance to travel to avert next week’s nurse strike.” The GMB union said ambulance strikes would go ahead as planned on Wednesday after the talks “fell short”. Rachel Harrison, GMB’s national secretary, said: “There was some engagement on pay – but not a concrete offer that could help resolve this dispute and make significant progress on the recruitment and retention crisis.” Physiotherapists also said they would be announcing strike dates later this week despite the talks.

It follows recent articles on inflation, energy, food and the cost of living. Canada: assertive unions getting results Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Canada’s trade union movement is among the more resilient in the OECD, the club of developed countries. This is related to laws that prevent “free riding”, which is where workers can benefit from collective agreements without being union members. Union density in Canada has been around 30% of workers since the turn of the century, although membership in the private sector is barely half that and slowly falling. In contrast, unionisation is high in public services (over 75%) and growing. This relatively stability has left Canadian workers better prepared to confront the impact of inflation on their wages. Unions made higher wage demands than in recent decades, and more frequently went on strike (continuing a trend from 2021). From January to October 2022, there were 145 strikes, and the final year tally will likely exceed the 161 in 2021 – itself a marked increase. A total of 1.9 million person-days of work were lost in strikes up to October (the highest in 15 years). Unlike in recent years, the majority were in the private sector. A spring wave of strikes in construction in Ontario (Canada’s most populous province) symbolised the increased militancy. At peak, over 40,000 workers downed tools for higher wages, including carpenters, dry-wallers and engineers. Tentative agreements reached by officials were sometimes rejected by members, prolonging the strikes. A second historic flash point came later in the year when Ontario’s right-wing government invoked a rarely used constitutional clause to override the right to strike for 55,000 education support workers. After unions in the public and private sector threatened a province-wide general strike, the government backed down. Meanwhile, employer lockouts have virtually disappeared. This tactic, in which employers suspend operations until workers agree to terms being offered, had only been used eight times by October, compared to 60 per year a decade ago. Annual wage growth increased modestly to an average of 5% by late in the year. That still lagged the 6.8% inflation, but closed the gap from 2021. It remains to be seen whether this union pressure can be sustained in the face of rapid interest rate increases, a likely recession in 2023, and continued government suppression of union rights in some provinces. United Kingdom: an olive branch for the health service? Phil Tomlinson, Professor of Industrial Strategy, University of Bath The UK’s latest winter of discontent is extending into 2023 as the country endures its largest wave of strikes in over 30 years. Most are in the public sector, where pay offers are well below inflation and significantly lag private companies. The sense of grievance is high following the austerity and real-terms pay cuts of the 2010s. Strikes – estimated to have cost the UK economy £1.7 billion in 2022 – are being co-ordinated across different unions, adding to the public inconvenience. The UK government has steadfastly refused to yield, however. It has hidden behind independent recommendations by public-sector pay review bodies, despite not always following them. They have also claimed that inflation matching public sector pay rises would cost each UK household an extra £1,000 a year, though this figure has been debunked. The Treasury also echoes Bank of England concerns about setting off a wage-price spiral. Yet this is unlikely, given the current inflation is largely down to supply shocks (from COVID and the war in Ukraine), while average wage growth is well below inflation. There is an economic case for a generous deal, especially in the National Health Service (NHS): with over 133,000 unfilled vacancies, better wages might help improve staff retention and recruitment. Of course, funding this in a recession involves tough choices. Higher taxes would be politically difficult with the tax burden at a 70-year high. Higher government borrowing could aggravate inflation if accommodated by the Bank of England increasing the money supply through more quantitative easing. Public opinion appears largely sympathetic to the strikes, especially in the NHS. But if the government relents in one sector, it sets a precedent for others, with potentially wider economic consequences. For the NHS, it may instead bring forward public sector pay review body negotiations for 2023 to allow for an improved deal – possibly alongside a one-off hardship payment. Elsewhere it will probably hold firm and hope the trade unions lose their resolve. Australia and New Zealand: strikes remain rare despite inflation Jim Stanford, Economist and Director, Centre for Future Work, Australia Institute Strikes in Australia have become very rare in recent decades, thanks to restrictive labour laws passed since the 1990s. Despite historically low unemployment and wages lagging far behind inflation, these laws continue to short-circuit most industrial action. In 2022, union density fell to 12.5% of employees, an all-time low. As recently as 1990, union density was over 50% of workers. Union members can legally strike only after negotiations, ballots and specific plans for action have been publicly divulged (thus fully revealing union strategy to the employer). Even when there are strikes, they tend to be short. A total of 182 industrial disputes occurred in the year to September. (The statistics don’t distinguish between strikes and employer lockouts, which have become common in Australia.) This is similar to the pre-COVID years, following a drop in 2020, and only a fraction of 1970s and 1980s industrial action. The only visible increase in strike action in 2022 was a series of one-day protest strikes organised by teachers and health care workers in New South Wales, the country’s most populous state. Having put up with a decade of austere wage caps by the conservative state government, they decided they had had enough as inflation picked up. Most other workers have been passive despite Australia experiencing among the slowest wage growth of any major industrial country. Nominal wages grew just 2% per year over the decade to 2021. That rose to 3.1% by late 2022, but it’s still less than half the 7.3% inflation rate. Australia’s newly elected Labor government did pass a series of important labour law reforms at the end of 2022, aimed at strengthening collective bargaining and wage growth. That might herald incremental improvement in workers’ bargaining power in the years ahead. The industrial relations outlook in New Zealand is somewhat more hospitable for workers and their unions. Union density increased in 2021, to 17% of employees (from 14% in 2020). Average ordinary hourly earnings grew an impressive 7.4% in the latest 12-month period – helped by a 6% boost in the minimum wage by New Zealand’s Labour government. Industrial action remains rare – perhaps in part because workers are successfully lifting wages via other means. No official strike data is available for 2022, but in 2021, just 20 work stoppages occurred, down sharply from an average of 140 per year in the previous three years. Indonesia: anger against labour law reforms Nabiyla Risfa Izzati, Lecturer of Labour Law, Universitas Gadjah Mada A few weeks ago, the government replaced its controversial “omnibus law” with new emergency regulation. This was in response to the Indonesian constitutional court finding it unconstitutional in 2021. Passed in late 2020, the omnibus law embodies President Joko Widodo’s ambition to attract foreign investors by slashing red tape at the cost of employees’ rights. It made it easier for businesses to lay off employees without prior notice. It also lowered statutory severance pay and extended the maximum length of temporary contracts, while ignoring worker safety. In 2022, its new formula to determine the minimum wage also resulted in the lowest annual increase ever. The law attracted much criticism from workers, activists and civil society organisations. The new emergency regulation is arguably even more problematic. The majority of its provision simply copies the omnibus law. Several changes and additional provisions are confusing and overlap with previous regulations, as well as leaving many loopholes that could be exploited in future. Yet despite complaints from workers and trade unions that the new rules were passed suddenly and without consultation, strike action is out of the question. Strikes are not popular because they can only be organised with permission from the company in question. If labourers hold informal strikes, employers also entitled to get rid of them. Public protests are the obvious alternative, though pandemic rules restricting mobility and mass gatherings have made these difficult. Nevetheless, thousands or perhaps even millions of workers staged protests in their respective cities in the second half of 2022. The workers wanted the omnibus law revoked, and for the government to not use the minimum wage formulations stipulated in the law. The demonstrations got more intense as the government raised subsidised fuel prices in September, which boosted already high inflation due to rising food prices. The government has since issued a separate regulation to determine the 2023 minimum wage, so the demands were successful, although both workers and employers are furious that the minimum wage rules have changed again under the emergency regulation. Clearly the protesters did not see the rest of the rules in the omnibus law removed. Some workers have been protesting on social media. This might not induce the government to change the law, but a few viral tweets have pushed several businesses to change abusive practices. The controversy is likely to continue in 2023 and into the election year of 2024, especially amid possible massive layoffs in the midst of a global recession. United States: worker protest showing signs of life Marick Masters, Professor of Business and Adjunct Professor of Political Science, Wayne State University US workers organised and took to the picket line in increased numbers in 2022 to demand better pay and working conditions, leading to optimism among labour leaders and advocates that they’re witnessing a turnaround in labour’s sagging fortunes. Teachers, journalists and baristas were among tens of thousands of workers who went on strike. And it took an act of Congress to prevent 115,000 railroad employees from walking out as well. In total, there have been at least 20 major work stoppages involving upwards of 1,000 workers each in 2022, up from 16 in 2021, plus hundreds more that were smaller. Workers at Starbucks, Amazon, Apple and dozens of other companies also filed over 2,000 petitions to form unions during the year – the most since 2015. Workers won 76% of the 1,363 elections that were held. Historically, however, these figures are tepid. The number of major work stoppages has been plunging for decades, from nearly 200 as recently as 1980. As of 2021, union membership was at about the lowest level on record, at 10.3%. In the 1950s, over one in three workers belonged to a union. The deck is still heavily stacked against unions, with unsupportive labour laws and very few employers showing real receptivity to having a unionised workforce. Unions are limited in how much they can change public policy. Reforming labour law through legislation has remained elusive, and the results of the 2022 midterms are not likely to make it easier. Nonetheless, public support for labour is at its highest since 1965, with 71% saying they approve of unions, according to a Gallup poll in August. And workers themselves are increasingly showing an interest in joining them. In 2017, 48% of workers polled said they would vote for union representation, up from 32% in 1995, the last time the question was asked. Future success may depend on unions’ ability to tap into their growing popularity and emulate the recent wins in establishing union representation at Starbucks and Amazon, as well as the successful “Fight for $15” campaign, which since 2012 has helped pass US$15 minimum wage laws in a dozen states and Washington DC. The odds may be steep, but the seeds of opportunity are there if labour can exploit them. This is an excerpt from an article published on January 5 2023. France: militant unions risk going too far Stéphanie Matteudi-Lecocq, Chercheuse au LEREDS, Directrice practice Chez Alixio, Université de Lille France in 2022 saw new industrial protests, from blockades of oil refineries, to unprecedented strikes at EDF’s nuclear power plants, to rail workers staying at home on public holidays. TotalEnergies announced “super profits” in the second quarter of 2022 and increased CEO Patrick Pouyanné’s salary by 52% to €5,944,129. In September the militant CGT union demanded a 10% salary increase for workers and called for a strike at the group’s refineries. Five of Total’s refineries went on strike, joined by two owned by ExxonMobil subsidiary Esso. Esso was already talking to its unions about a pay deal, but Total had only planned to open negotiations in November. The strikes in the refineries threatened to bring France to a standstill, and the CGT used its power over this key resource to demand that discussions begin more quickly with Total (in the end, the company negotiated earlier and pay deals were done, ending the strikes by early November). The strike at EDF’s nuclear power stations similarly gave the company’s workers the balance of power because it made it impossible for France to build up energy reserves (since fossil fuels had to be burned to make up for the lack of nuclear power). In the end, the company signed deals with the unions in October. Unions may have succeeded in both cases, but they are arguably endangered by these kinds of practices. Too many trades union leaders remain stuck in their old militant ways. There’s a fragile balance between negotiation and protest, and such ransom tactics might damage unions’ public image, making dialogue more difficult in future. In 50 years, the rate of unionisation in France has already halved from over 20% to around 10%. It’s telling that two of the major strikes at the end of 2022, first by train workers and then by general practitioners, were initiated by groups independent from the unions. They both started spontaneously through social media and the unions found out very late. In 2023 the unions have an opportunity to improve their influence if they manage to prevent the government from passing its unpopular bill on pensions, which seeks to raise the full pensionable retirement age from 62 to 64 or 65. The unions have already announced their strong opposition to the bill. With major demonstrations due to take place after the full bill is presented today, January 10, it will be interesting to see their tactics. This is based on an excerpt from an article published in October 2022. Spain: unequal support measures could cause trouble Rubén Garrido-Yserte, Director del Instituto Universitario de Análisis Económico y Social, Universidad de Alcalá Global inflation is triggering a global economic slowdown and interest rates raised to levels not seen since before 2008. Interest rates will continue to rise in 2023, especially affecting economies as indebted as Spain. It will undermine both families’ disposable income and the profitability of companies (especially small ones), while making public debt repayments more expensive. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to cause a sustained increase in the cost of the shopping basket in the medium term. Government measures have partially mitigated this loss of purchasing power so far. Spain capped power prices, subsidised fuel and made public transport free for urbanites and commuters. There were agreements with banks to refinance mortgages for the most vulnerable families. Plus there have been increases in pensions and public salaries and there are plans to raise the minimum wage. However, many of these measures must necessarily be temporary. The danger is that they come to be seen as rights that should not be renounced. They also distort the economy and create problems with fairness by excluding or insufficiently supporting some groups. Private salaries will not rise enough to cover inflation, for instance. The government’s measures have been such that there has been very little industrial action in response to the cost of living crisis. The danger is that they create a scenario where today’s calm may be the harbinger of a social storm tomorrow.

Ms Somerville said there is still “some distance” between the two sides in the pay dispute. On Tuesday, primary schools around the country closed after last-ditch talks failed to prevent strike action, with secondary school staff set to walk out on Wednesday. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. A meeting of the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers (SNCT), which brings together unions, local authorities and the Scottish Government, took place on Monday in an attempt to avert the strike action. As the Scottish Parliament resumed following the winter recess, Conservative Stephen Kerr spoke about the SNCT meeting. He said: “Teachers are on strike for the first time in 40 years, because this SNP Government has repeatedly let them down.” Ms Somerville said it had been “constructive”, adding that she could not give further details while negotiations are ongoing. Referring to “anti-trade union” legislation at Westminster, she continued: “I will take no lectures from Mr Kerr or any other Conservative member of this parliament, saying that we should be doing more to actually settle disputes.” The Lib Dems’ Willie Rennie asked if there would be a new offer for teachers, saying: “The Education Secretary does seem to be very chilled out and relaxed.” Ms Somerville said both sides in the dispute would have to compromise in order to reach a resolution, adding: “We will, of course, leave no stone unturned to try and do that as quickly as possible. “No one wants to see strike action in our schools.” Speaking on BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland programme earlier, Ms Somerville described the union pay demands as “simply unaffordable”. After talks ended in failure, members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), NASUWT, Scottish Secondary Teachers’ Association (SSTA) and the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS) are taking strike action. It follows SSTA and NASUWT members taking two days of action in December while EIS members walked out on November 24. Asked whether she expected a new offer to be on the table before the end of the week, Ms Somerville said: “We’ll continue discussions with the unions. “I think the challenge that we have is we remain some distance apart on what the Scottish Government and local government can afford and can put on the table from the union demand which is, of course, a 10% increase in pay. “If that had been accepted, if the 5% had been accepted, you would’ve actually seen teachers have a 21.8% cumulative rise since 2018. “So we’re trying very hard to have a fair and affordable package on the table but we do remain unfortunately some distance apart.” She added: “The pay demands we’re having from our trade union colleagues are simply unaffordable for the Scottish Government working on a fixed budget, already allocated, also eroded by inflation and that does make it a very difficult and challenging process to come to a conclusion and resolution on.” Earlier in the programme, Mike Corbett, NASUWT Scotland national official, echoed the concerns that unions and Government were still far away from agreement on pay. He said the last offer made in November was “dressed up as an improved offer” but did not improve pay for the “vast majority of teachers”. He added: “There’s still no formal revised offer on the table and that is the reason why our members and others feel they’ve got no alternative but to be out on strike again today and tomorrow.” Nicola Sturgeon also spoke to journalists about the strike on Tuesday. The First Minister said: “I deeply regret that we have industrial action in our schools. “I don’t think that’s in the interest of young people at all. “That said, I understand the strength of feeling of teachers and we highly value the teaching profession.” However, she said: “I can’t create additional funding that we don’t have and I’ve tried to be really honest with unions across the public sector. “We’re trying to be as fair as possible while maximising pay increases.”",Somerville: No stone will be left unturned in bid to resolve school strikes,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/scottish-government-teachers-education-secretary-scottish-parliament-conservative-b1052061.html

Gareth Davies, the auditor and comptroller general at the NAO, said keeping on top of conflicts of interest was a “crucial part of public stewardship” that was not always followed during the VIP fast lane process. He said the government had given detailed responses on how it would improve its processes after reports from the NAO and others highlighting a failure to adhere to basic standards of procurement when awarding some contracts during the pandemic. But the auditor general said the NAO was watching closely to make sure its recommendations on procurement and pandemic preparedness “do not get lost” as the government deals with other crises such as Ukraine and high energy prices. “We are always careful to recognise the exceptional circumstances but despite the intense pressure it is always necessary to cover basic areas of transparency,” Davies said. “Publishing what you’ve done within the normal timescales is still possible even in an emergency and the whole process around conflicts of interest. “You may well need a speeded up system for referring plausible suppliers of PPE into the system but you should absolutely insist that people should declare it if they have a private interest in that supplier, particularly if they are holding a position of authority or responsibility like a peer or an MP or a senior civil servant. That just couldn’t be demonstrated. “There were clearly people attempting to do that at different stages but there wasn’t a clear trail of how that had been handled. The reason was the sheer pressure of the emergency but you can see now where that leads you if you are not careful.” His comments come after the scandal over Mone, on a leave of absence as a Conservative peer, who is the subject of an inquiry over her alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro during the pandemic. She has vowed to clear her name. Davies gave his assessment after the NAO carried out 36 detailed reports on the £300bn of government’s spending during the Covid pandemic. In an interview with the Guardian, he said the NAO was looking carefully at resilience to help the UK become better financially prepared for events that may require big public spending, guarding against the “collective failure of imagination” to prepare adequately for a major pandemic. He said there would be better “stress testing” of emergency responses, and the NAO would look at preparedness across the board, asking: “How do you avoid being caught out by this?” “You could argue it has happened on more than just Covid. What’s happening on energy is pretty unprecedented and needs another emergency scheme developed at high speed from scratch. We don’t want to have to do that every time,” he said. Davies also warned about the effects of inflation on public sector budgets, especially major infrastructure projects such as HS2 and roads, as well as highlighting the risks that the NHS will not meet its targets on eliminating waits of longer than a year by 2025. Davies said the NAO has been pointing out the “headwinds that the NHS is facing in implementing the planned approach” to waiting lists as well as highlighting the “numbers that the plan was based on assumed the best case scenario … not a severe winter in cases of flu and … [without] the industrial action that is currently under way”. He said the NAO’s report from November highlighted “serious risks” in meeting the 2025 target on eliminating waits of longer than 12 months and its job was now to monitor progress and “help identify barriers to getting through the backlog faster”. “Clearly, a lot of those risks that we identified are still present,” he added. Rishi Sunak recommitted to the NHS waiting list targets last week as one of his major priorities. Davies said inflation was a major risk to the NHS budget as well as departments with exposure to construction costs such as “HS2 and the other rail and road improvement schemes”. Warning that the government has “difficult decisions” ahead on major infrastructure projects, he said it was possible to reduce the scope of some projects or make the case for more money but on others said: “You either do it or you don’t: you have a have binary choice there. So there are some very difficult decisions for government.” Davies said HS2 was a “good example where the legs that have currently been committed to are going to cost more than when the most recent decision to recommit to the schemes was taken, so that’s going to have to be taken into account in one way or another, either through additional funding or through looking at the future scope of the scheme”.","MPs and peers should declare links to firms they back for contracts, says NAO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/mps-and-peers-should-declare-links-to-firms-they-back-for-contracts-says-nao

Régis Schultz, the chief executive of JD, said young shoppers had more cash in their pockets than a year ago thanks to the reopening of retail and hospitality which had provided jobs, while inflation had prompted people to go out and buy instead of waiting for bargains.

Heathrow says this is the highest passenger increase of any airport in Europe, “and possibly worldwide”.But it warns:We are concerned that the recovery of the aviation sector, which is critical to the economy, could be set back by the reintroduction of testing for travellers in the UK and elsewhere in response to increasing COVID levels in China, even though governments acknowledge there is no scientific basis for doing so.UK prime minister Rishi Sunak decided to introduce tests on arrivals from China at the end of December, after other countries including the US and Italy brought in similar measures.But scientists told the Observer that screening people coming from China would make little difference, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the UK was already very high, while airport checks had been shown to be unreliable in pinpointing disease carriers.Sunak’s U-turn on China Covid tests is a political move, say scientistsRead moreIf there is to be a correction in UK house prices, it will be driven by the homeowners whose fixed rate mortgage deals are set to expire over the next 12 months, says Zainab Atiyyah, analyst at Third Bridge.Mortgage and Bank of England interest rates started to increase during 2022 – and at least 1.4 millionUK households face the prospect of interest rate rises when they renew their fixed rate mortgages this year.➡️ https://t.co/HwWjla2Iwl pic.twitter.com/QKvIRIYbOU— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) January 9, 2023 But the UK’s “massive undersupply of new-build and second-hand houses.” will cushion that effect, Atiyyah points out.“Overall, our experts expect a slowdown in sales to continue in 2023 despite new stamp duty thresholds, as supply continues to dwindle.” “Those on Help to Buy deals will be crossing their fingers and hoping their deals don’t fall apart as new homes are delayed or not completed by the end of the year. Looking forward, housebuilders may have to offer their own shared equity schemes to make their homes more affordable to first-time buyers.” “With first-time buyers facing a very challenging environment, Barratt is likely to focus on the middle market, changing its product mix to increase the volume of detached and 3-4-bedroom homes.”Many City economists and housing economists predict house prices will drop this year, as this table shows:Soothsayers compete for the 2023 House Price Prediction top spot.

These claims, combined with further increases in motor inflation, have had a significant impact on our underwriting result for 2022.Direct Line says it expects around £90m of claims from the ‘freeze event’ in December. It has helped three thousand customers deal with burst pipes, water tanks and other related damage.Direct Line says:This, together with the freeze event from January 2022 and subsidence related claims over the summer means that we currently expect total weather claims to be in the region of £140 million for 2022, well above our 2022 expectation of £73 million.Direct Line’s motor insurance division also saw an increase in third party claims inflation during the fourth quarter of last year, and more claims in the quarter --partly due to adverse weather conditions.Shares in Direct Line have tumbled 28%, to 166p.JD Sports has also predicted its profits will be towards the top end of expectations, following a jump in sales over Christmas.JD Sports’ revenues grew by over 10% in the 22 weeks to 31 December 2022, accelerating to more than 20% in the six-weeks to 31 December 2022.It now expects pre-tax profits for the year to 28 January to be “towards the top end” of market expectations (£933m to £985m), although the final performance depends how the post-Christmas sales go.Shares in JD Sports have jumped 4.6% in early trading, to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard.Record sales of Champagne and prosecco have helped to push profits at Sainsbury’s to the upper end of forecasts.The supermarket chain has reported that profits this year are expected to be towards the upper end of its guidance range of £630m to £690m, although still below last year’s profits of £730m.J Sainsbury’s retail sales, excluding fuel, rose by 5.2% year-on-year in its third quarter (to 7th January). Grocery sales were 5.6% higher – and 12.5% ahead of pre-pandemic levels.And in the Christmas period, sales rose 7.1%, with grocery sales up 7.1%, general merchandise sales up 7.4% and clothing sales up 5.1%.That included a 22% jump in Taste the Difference Mince Pies, and a 49% rise in Taste the Difference Panettone, while there was “record sales for Champagne and prosecco”.But Simon Roberts, chief executive of J Sainsbury, flags that 2023 will be tough for households.“We understand money will be exceptionally tight this year particularly as many people wait for Christmas bills to land.

Rishi Sunak had previously refused to say whether he uses private healthcare, insisting it was ""not really relevant"". It followed a press report that Mr Sunak is registered with a private GP practice which charges £250 per consultation. At PMQs, Mr Sunak praised his local hospital ""for the fantastic care they have given my family"". ""That's why I'm passionately committed to protecting it with more funding, more doctors and nurses, and a clear plan to cut the waiting lists,"" he added. Mr Sunak had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that his healthcare was ""a personal choice"". ""As a general policy I wouldn't ever talk about me or my family's healthcare situation … it's not really relevant,"" he told the programme. Registering with an NHS GP does not exclude someone from using private healthcare. The prime minister's spokeswoman said Mr Sunak did not currently have private cover but declined to say when he registered with the NHS. ""In principle, he believes that the personal health details of individuals should remain private, but given the level of interest and in the interests of transparency he has set out that he is registered with a NHS GP,"" she said. A newspaper report in November suggested Mr Sunak was registered with a private GP practice that offers on-the-day appointments and home visits. Latest NHS figures show that in November last year, 58% of NHS patients were not seen on the day they made an appointment. At the same time, a record high of more than seven million people are waiting for hospital treatment. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in response to Mr Sunak's comments that the prime minister ""will find out what it's like to wait on hold at 08:00 as you call for an appointment"". Sir Keir's spokesman confirmed the Labour leader had never used private healthcare. He said he was ""not going to comment on individual health choices"" and Labour was focused on ""ensuring we have the best possible NHS"" for everyone in the country. Sir Keir also clashed with Mr Sunak over the government's plan for new legislation to enforce minimum service levels in the NHS and other key sectors. The Tories had gone ""from clapping nurses to sacking nurses"", Sir Keir said, adding that nurses and ambulance workers would not be on strike if the prime minister had negotiated. The prime minister said Sir Keir would not agree to minimum service levels in the NHS ""because he's on the side of his union paymasters, not patients"". Mr Sunak added that he wanted ""to have constructive dialogue with the unions"" and had accepted the recommendations of independent pay review bodies. Earlier, health unions announced they are pulling out of the NHS Pay Review Body process to determine pay for next year. The 14 unions - representing more than one million ambulance staff, nurses and other NHS workers in England - have called for direct negotiations with ministers about pay. Mr Sunak's comments followed Health Secretary Steve Barclay confirming he used an NHS doctor. Pressed on whether he has NHS care during an interview on LBC, Mr Barclay replied: ""Yes, I don't subscribe to private provision. ""But I don't have a problem with people, with their own money, who wish to spend that money on private healthcare. ""I think that is a perfectly reasonable thing for people to want to do."" Some of Mr Sunak's predecessors have made a point of drawing attention to their use of the NHS when they were prime minister. David Cameron often spoke about how the NHS cared for his disabled son, while Boris Johnson said the health service saved his life after he fell seriously ill with Covid. But when Mrs Thatcher was prime minister she was candid about her use of private health insurance, which she said was vital for her to ""go into hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want"".",PMQs: Rishi Sunak says he is registered with NHS doctor,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-64237830?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Mr Kerr slammed the SNP for treating experienced workers as being easily replaceable after the report stated “the age profile of oil and gas workers means a significant proportion are expected to retire” during the First Minister’s acceleration of closing the industry. The energy strategy added it is positive that fewer young people were entering the sector, stating 12 per cent of the oil and gas workforce is under 30. This is despite warnings from the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board that more workers are required to meet future levels of labour demand. But the SNP’s aim of closing down the sector is at odds with what their Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn, believes after he said last year that investment in North Sea oil and gas was vital for jobs in Aberdeen. Mr Kerr, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for net zero, energy and transport, said: “The SNP is threatening to destroy the lives of oil and gas workers with its uninformed intention of closing down the sector at its earliest point. “The assertion that the majority of these workers will be retiring is utterly reckless and a slap in the face to those who have dedicated years of service to such a valuable industry to our north-east economy. “This report implies it is a good thing fewer young people are entering the sector when all the evidence points to the very opposite as more people are needed to cope with labour demand. “The negative narrative of this is putting our younger generation off from having a long, productive career in an industry which supports countries worldwide. “Oil and gas is essential to securing our energy supply while also protecting tens of thousands of Scottish jobs. Yet this SNP energy strategy completely undermines the sector which will result in us relying on more expensive imports which do more damage to the environment. “This last week, many north-east residents watched in horror as a baleful, unnatural force threatened to hamper the livelihoods of North Sea workers. “After Nicola Sturgeon’s bid to toss more than 70,000 oil and gas jobs in the skip and wreck the energy transition, they should probably give it another week before trying to watch The Rig as well.” Do you want to respond to this article?

This is as true of climate chaos as anything else. We are hemmed in by stories that prevent us from seeing, or believing in, or acting on the possibilities for change. Some are habits of mind, some are industry propaganda. Sometimes, the situation has changed but the stories haven’t, and people follow the old versions, like outdated maps, into dead ends. We need to leave the age of fossil fuel behind, swiftly and decisively. But what drives our machines won’t change until we change what drives our ideas. The visionary organiser adrienne maree brown wrote not long ago that there is an element of science fiction in climate action: “We are shaping the future we long for and have not yet experienced. I believe that we are in an imagination battle.” In order to do what the climate crisis demands of us, we have to find stories of a livable future, stories of popular power, stories that motivate people to do what it takes to make the world we need. Perhaps we also need to become better critics and listeners, more careful about what we take in and who’s telling it, and what we believe and repeat, because stories can give power – or they can take it away. To change our relationship to the physical world – to end an era of profligate consumption by the few that has consequences for the many – means changing how we think about pretty much everything: wealth, power, joy, time, space, nature, value, what constitutes a good life, what matters, how change itself happens. As the climate journalist Mary Heglar writes, we are not short on innovation. “We’ve got loads of ideas for solar panels and microgrids. While we have all of these pieces, we don’t have a picture of how they come together to build a new world. For too long, the climate fight has been limited to scientists and policy experts. While we need their skills, we also need so much more. When I survey the field, it’s clear that what we desperately need is more artists.” What the climate crisis is, what we can do about it, and what kind of a world we can have is all about what stories we tell and whose stories are heard. Climate change was a story that fell on mostly indifferent ears when it was first discussed in the mainstream more than 30 years ago. Even a dozen years ago, it was supposed to be happening very slowly and in the distant future. There were a lot of references to “our grandchildren’s time”. It was a problem that was difficult to grasp – this dispersed, incremental, atmospheric, invisible, global problem with many causes and manifestations, whose solutions are also dispersed and manifold. That voices from the climate movement have finally succeeded in making the vast majority understand it, and many care passionately about it, might be the biggest single victory the movement will have. Because once you’ve won the popular imagination, you’ve changed the game and its possible outcomes. But this was a long, slow, arduous process, and misconceptions still abound. A lot of people don’t know that we’ve largely won the battle to make people aware and concerned. The LA Times ran a well-intentioned editorial last year about how most Americans don’t care about climate breakdown. That was true once, but no longer is. A Pew Research poll in 2020 concluded that two-thirds of Americans wanted to see more government action on climate, but last summer the scientific journal Nature published a study concluding that most Americans believe that only a minority (37-43%) support climate action, when in reality a large majority (66-80%) does. That gap between perceived and actual support undermines motivation and confidence. We need better stories – and sometimes better means more up to date. Outright climate denial – the old story that climate change isn’t real – has been rendered largely obsolete (outside social media) by climate-driven catastrophes around the globe and good work by climate activists and journalists. But other stories still stop us from seeing clearly. Greenwashing – the schemes created by fossil fuel corporations and others to portray themselves as on the environment’s side while they continue their profitable destruction – is rampant. It’s harder to recognise a false friend than an honest enemy, and their false solutions, delaying tactics and empty promises can be confusing for non-experts. Fortunately, as the climate movement has diversified, one new organisation, Clean Creatives, focuses specifically on pressuring advertising and PR agencies to stop doing the industry’s dirty work. Likewise, climate journalists are exposing how fossil fuel money is funding pseudo-environmental opposition to offshore wind turbines. (As the climate activist and oil policy analyst Antonia Juhasz recently told me, the climate movement is now going after every aspect of the fossil fuel industry, including funding by banks and, via the divestment movement, shares held by investors; donations to politicians; insurers; permits for extraction; transport; refinement; emissions, notably through lawsuits concerning their impact; shutting coal-fired power plants; and pushing for a rapid transition to electrification.) But we still lack stories that give context. For example, I see people excoriate the mining, principally for lithium and cobalt, that will be an inevitable part of building renewables – turbines, batteries, solar panels, electric machinery – apparently oblivious to the far vaster scale and impact of fossil fuel mining. If you’re concerned about mining on indigenous land, about local impacts or labour conditions, I give you the biggest mining operations ever undertaken: for oil, gas, and coal, and the hungry machines that must constantly consume them. Extracting material that will be burned up creates the incessant cycle of consumption on which the fossil fuel industry has grown fabulously rich. It creates climate chaos as well as destruction and contamination at every stage of the process. Globally, burning fossil fuels kills almost 9 million people annually, a death toll larger than any recent war. But that death toll is largely invisible for lack of compelling stories about it. All mining needs to be done with respect for the land and people in the vicinity, but the impact of mining for renewables needs to be weighed against the far more devastating impact of mining for and burning fossil fuel. The race is on to find battery materials that are more commonly available and less impactful than lithium and cobalt, and some of the results look promising. Last summer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced an aluminium-sulphur battery is in the works, while a US company is developing one that stores electricity using iron – the so-called “iron-air” battery. Efforts to extract battery materials from longterm coal waste in West Virginia are among the many others under way. And the Inflation Reduction Act includes funding to research better battery materials and domestic US sources. Other stories of premature defeat are all too common. In the 400,000-strong 2014 climate march in New York City, one section marched behind a huge banner declaring “WE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS” – but many people still believe we do not. We have the solutions we need in solar and wind; we just need to build them out and make the transition, fast. Looking to wildly ineffectual carbon sequestration and other undeveloped technologies as a relevant solution is like ignoring the lifeboats at hand in the hope that fancy new ones are coming when the ship is sinking and speed is of the essence. One story I frequently encounter frames the possibilities in absolutes: if we can’t win everything, then we lose everything. There are so many doom-soaked stories out there – about how civilisation, humanity, even life itself, are scheduled to die out. This apocalyptic thinking is due to another narrative failure: the inability to imagine a world different than the one we currently inhabit. People without much sense of history imagine the world as static. They assume that if the present order is failing, the system is collapsing, and there is no alternative. A historical imagination equips you to understand that change is ceaseless. You only have to look to the past to see such a world, dramatically different half a century ago, stunningly so a century ago. The UK, for example, ran almost entirely on coal power until the 1960s, and if you had said then that it would have to quit coal, many would have imagined this meant an utter collapse of the energy system, not its transformation. Even in 2008, the organisation Carbon Brief noted, “four-fifths of the UK’s electricity came from fossil fuels. Since then, the UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy. Coal-fired power has virtually disappeared and even gas use is down by a quarter. Instead, the country now gets more than half of its electricity from low-carbon sources, such as solar, wind and nuclear.” Scotland already generates nearly all the electricity it needs from renewables. While I often hear people casually assert that our world is doomed, no reputable scientist makes such claims. Most are deeply worried, but far from hopeless. There are already profound losses, but our action or inaction determine how much more loss will occur, and whose it will be, and some repair is possible. Efforts sufficient to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could lower temperatures and reverse some aspects of climate breakdown. Even the journalist David Wallace-Wells, who rose to fame with a deeply pessimistic book about climate a few years ago, has shifted his view. He currently describes a future somewhere between the best and worst case scenarios, a future “with the most terrifying predictions made improbable by decarbonisation and the most hopeful ones practically foreclosed by tragic delay. The window of possible climate futures is narrowing, and as a result, we are getting a clearer sense of what’s to come: a new world, full of disruption … yet mercifully short of true climate apocalypse.” A climate story we urgently need is one that exposes who is actually responsible for climate chaos. It’s been popular to say that we are all responsible, but Oxfam reports that over the past 25 years, the carbon impact of the top 1% of the wealthiest human beings was twice that of the bottom 50%, so responsibility for the impact and the capacity to make change is currently distributed very unevenly. By saying “we are all responsible”, we avoid the fact that the global majority of us don’t need to change much, but a minority needs to change a lot. This is also a reminder that the idea that we need to renounce our luxuries and live more simply doesn’t really apply to the majority of human beings outside what we could perhaps call the overdeveloped world. What is true of Beverly Hills is not true of the majority from Bangladesh to Bolivia. When it comes to who’s harming the climate, it’s also been popular to focus on individual contributions. The fossil fuel industry likes the narrative of personal responsibility as a way to keep us scrutinising ourselves and one another, rather than them. They’ve promoted the concept of climate footprints as a way to keep the focus on us and not them, and it’s worked. Usually if I ask people what they’re doing about the climate emergency, most will talk about what they’re not consuming or doing – but these will never add up to the speed and scale of change needed to change the system. One of the goals of system change is to supersede individual virtue. Just as you no longer have to opt in to buying a car with seatbelts or ask for the no-smoking section on the train or restaurant, at some point in the near future you won’t have to opt into travelling in an electric car or bus, or living or working in all-electric buildings. Electrification will have happened because of the collective action that takes shape as policy and regulation. Last year, the veteran environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote a brilliant analysis pointing out that if you have money in one of the banks funding fossil fuels – especially, in the US, Wells Fargo, Chase, Citi, and Bank of America – your retirement funds or savings account may have a much larger climate footprint than you do. The impact of your diet and how you get to work may pale in comparison to the impact of your money in the bank. The vegan on the bicycle may still be contributing to climate chaos if her life savings are in a bank lending her money to the fossil fuel industry. Individual impact, leaving the ultra-wealthy aside, matters mostly in the aggregate. And in aggregate we can change that. On 21 March, McKibben, via his new climate group Third Act (on whose advisory board I sit), and dozens of other climate groups will be organising actions by people with money in, or credit cards from, the key US banks, to try to force those institutions to stop funding fossil fuels. Our greatest power lies in our roles as citizens, not consumers, when we can band together to collectively change how our world works. Various campaigns around the world have focused on fossil finance, with significant successes behind them, and much more to achieve ahead. The climate movement has become far more sophisticated and precise in its targets in recent years. It’s doing a brilliant job; it just needs enough people and resources behind it to be more powerful than the status quo. Last year, I took three activists who were formerly part of the Sunrise Movement, a youth group campaigning to address climate breakdown, to see the 1991 film Terminator 2 at a cinema. The film was as great as I remembered, not least because the lead character, Linda Hamilton playing a ferocious young mother, chooses as her motto “no fate but what we make”. In that movie, the future has come back to meddle with the present through the sci-fi technologies of time travel and robot-warrior terminators. We see how actions in the present shape the future through tremendous battles over what that future will be. This is, of course, just as true in real life. We don’t get terminators and other time-travellers to tell us what the consequences of our actions are, but they still have consequences. You ban the insecticide DDT, and a lot of bird species stop dying out. You ban chlorofluorocarbons, and the hole in the ozone layer stops growing. In another way, Terminator 2 is less useful as a lens for thinking about the climate crisis. It’s part of the conventions of storytelling in film – and comics, fiction, graphic novels and too many news narratives – that tells us that the world can only be saved by exceptional individuals, often loners, whose gifts are often the capacity to inflict and endure extreme violence. Linda Hamilton and co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot, clobber, crush, outrun and outfight everything thrown at them, and that’s their celebrated skillset, along with a bit of dry humour. Humour aside, this has little to do with how the world really gets changed most of the time. The skills of real-world superheroes are solidarity, strategy, patience, persistence, vision and the ability to inspire hope in others. The rescuers we need are mostly not individuals, they are collectives – movements, coalitions, campaigns, civil society. Within those groups there may be someone with an exceptional gift for motivating others, but even the world’s greatest conductor needs an orchestra. One person cannot do much; a movement can topple a regime. We are sadly lacking stories in which collective actions or the patient determination of organisers is what changes the world. Another thing we get from our films and fictions is the expectation of a single solution and a clear resolution to our problems: a sudden victory, a celebration, and the trouble is over. The climate crisis does not fit easily into this format. Ceasing to extract and burn fossil fuel is central, but there is no single solution. Protecting carbon-sequestering peat bogs, forests and grasslands also matters; so does transforming high-impact materials such as cement; implementing better design for buildings, transport and cities, and addressing soil conservation, farming and food production and consumption. There are milestones and important goals, but the familiar Hollywood ending – crossing the finish line to wrap up the story – doesn’t describe this reality. Change often functions more like a relay race, with new protagonists picking up where the last left off. In 2019, a Berkeley city councilwoman decided to propose banning fossil-gas connections in new construction, and it was passed by the council unanimously. This small city’s commitment to all-electric new buildings could seem insignificant, but more than 50 other California municipalities picked it up, as did the city of New York. The state of New York failed to pass a similar measure, but Washington state succeeded, and the idea that new construction should not include gas has spread internationally. Such relay races have long been how human rights campaigns work: a good protest, campaign, or even piece of legislation can introduce new ideas that do their own work in the world at large. Even failed campaigns may succeed in opening the path for later change. The Green New Deal did not pass in the US Senate, but it became a template for the Biden administration’s climate legislation, and shifted the conversation about what is possible. It led the way to the Inflation Reduction Act, the biggest climate bill the US has ever passed. Opponents of environmental action often say it is killing jobs; the Green New Deal did a lot to change that story by portraying climate action as a job creator. Recognising the reality of climate breakdown means recognising the interconnectedness of all things. That connection brings obligation: to respect nature, to build domestic regulation and international treaties that protect what’s needed, to limit the freedom of the individual in the name of the wellbeing of the collective. This is, of course, a worldview in direct contrast with free-market fundamentalism and libertarianism. Even the facts of climate science are ideologically offensive to people committed to individual freedom without accountability, let alone the demands created by treaties and regulations. Responsibility and obligation are dismal words in mainstream culture, so perhaps there will be other stories that recognise this process as reciprocity and relationship, in which we give back, in gratitude and respect for all the Earth does for us. Even short of that, we can recognise our self-interest in maintaining the system on which life depends. If news is the daily report on what’s just happened, we need a way of pulling back from individual events, to see the broad context of how it happened. If you only tell short-term stories, it all becomes kind of meaningless. Martin Luther King Jr said: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” We’ve seen it bend a lot of ways in recent years, toward and away from justice, but it takes time just to see it bend at all. You need benchmarks or memories of how things used to be even to see change of any kind, including climate change. The South Pacific climate activist and poet Julian Aguon recently declared that Indigenous peoples “have a unique capacity to resist despair through connection to collective memory, and just might be our best hope to build a new world rooted in reciprocity and mutual respect – for the Earth and for each other”. That emphasis on collective memory suggests that a strong sense of the past allows for a strong sense of the future, that remembering difficulty and transformation equips us to face them again. One of the things that buoys me up is the long arc of change in renewable technology. Mostly what you see in the news about renewables is short-term: stories on the latest drop in price, or proliferation of solar and wind over the past year or two. If you enlarge your time frame, you see that those annual changes have amounted to an astonishing plummet in prices and rise in efficiency and global use, compounded by innovations in materials and storage. Twenty years ago we did not have constructive ways to leave the age of fossil fuel behind. Now we do. And the solutions keep getting better. In 2021, the organisation Carbon Tracker put out a report that showed current technology could produce 100 times as much electricity from solar and wind than current global demand. The report concludes: “The technical and economic barriers have been crossed and the only impediment to change is political.” At the end of the last millennium, those barriers seemed insurmountable. The change is revolutionary, but the revolution was too slow to be visible to most. The report continues: “At the current 15-20% growth rates of solar and wind, fossil fuels will be pushed out of the electricity sector by the mid-2030s and out of total energy supply by 2050. The unlocking of energy reserves 100 times our current demand creates new possibilities for cheaper energy and more local jobs in a more equitable world, with far less environmental stress.” We tend to think utopias are unbelievable, but this is a sober-minded thinktank focused on climate and energy politics. The report made little impact on the general public. Because the energy revolution has been incremental, there’s been no single breakthrough moment. Yet it adds up to an encouraging, and even astonishing narrative. On the other hand, people find grim narratives all too believable, whether or not they are grounded in fact. We are still inundated by harmful, as well as untrue, stories about climate and the future. Prophecies can be self-fulfilling: if you insist that we cannot possibly win, you pit yourself against the possibility of victory and the people trying to achieve it. There’s yet another narrative that’s persisted at least since the invention of compact fluorescent lightbulbs and the Toyota Prius: that we must renounce abundance and enter an age of austerity. It’s all in the telling. To consider our age an age of abundance, you have to be counting sheer accumulated stuff and ignoring how it is distributed. That is, we live in an age of extreme wealth for some, and desperation for the many. But there’s another way to count wealth and abundance – as hope for the future, safety and public confidence, emotional wellbeing, love and friendship and strong social networks, meaningful work and purposeful lives, equality and justice and inclusion. Early on, we heard that renewables were very expensive – this was part of the austerity narrative, or an excuse for not making the transition. But improvements in design and economies of scale are among the factors making them the cheapest form of electricity almost everywhere on earth. There’s no reason to think the innovations of design and economic improvements are all behind us; I suspect they’re mostly ahead of us. Engineer and energy expert Saul Griffith recently wrote: “Most people believe a clean-energy future will require everyone to make do with less, but it actually means we can have better things.” The old story was that we couldn’t afford to do what the climate emergency required. The new one is that it would not only be ecologically devastating, but more expensive not to. Renewables are on the way to being cheaper than fossil fuel; in many places, they already are. Texas and Iowa get a huge amount of their electricity from wind because it makes economic sense, not because these red states are passionate about addressing the climate crisis. Over their lifetime, electric cars work out to be cheaper than internal combustion cars because charging and maintaining them is cheaper. And of course these two examples don’t include the indirect effects of burning fossil fuels on human health and the climate. A lot of people tend to measure climate action in terms of huge national or international news events, but the change that matters is often happening at local and regional and other levels. A university divests; a state sets a date for ending the sale of new petrol cars; a city passes a measure mandating all-electric new buildings; ground is broken on a major solar installation; a state or country sets a new record for percentage of wind power in its energy mix; a pipeline or gas terminal or drilling site gets cancelled; a carbon-sequestering forest or peat bog gets protected status; a coal plant closes. This does not erase all the bad news, about continuing breakdown of natural systems and its toll on human lives and impact on a livable future, but it does contextualise them as crises we can respond to if we choose to. So much is happening, both wonderful and terrible, and it adds up to more stories than almost anyone can take in. But the overarching frameworks in which we receive them matter, and so do the critical skills to recognise, choose, and change stories. The climate crisis is a problem with no single solution, but many, just as there is no one saviour, but many protagonists in the struggle. In 2019, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg said we must embrace “cathedral thinking”, adding: “We must lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling.” The speculative fiction writer Octavia Butler included this passage in one of her essays: “OK,” the young man challenged. “So what’s the answer?” “There isn’t one,” I told him. “No answer? You mean we’re just doomed?” He smiled as though he thought this might be a joke. “No,” I said. “I mean there’s no single answer that will solve all of our future problems. There’s no magic bullet. Instead there are thousands of answers – at least. You can be one of them if you choose to be.” This is an edited version of a speech given at Princeton University in November 2022","‘If you win the popular imagination, you change the game’: why we need new stories on climate",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/12/rebecca-solnit-climate-crisis-popular-imagination-why-we-need-new-stories

If its construction goes to plan, a €2.5 billion (£2.18 billion) undersea pipeline will convey “green hydrogen” from Spain to France from 2030. In the US, some power stations are being upgraded to allow hydrogen to be blended with fossil gas, and the Norwegian oil company Equinor is teaming up with Thermal SSE to build a 1,800 megawatt (MW) “blue hydrogen” power plant in Britain. Meanwhile, China unveiled a plan in March which includes deploying 50,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2025 and early December saw the first hydrogen-fuelled tractors and forklifts leave the assembly line at a new plant in Guangdong province. Hydrogen is produced in multiple ways. A colour spectrum is used to render it simple. “Grey” and “brown/black” hydrogen come from fossil gas (methane) and coal (brown or black coal) respectively – a process that, for every tonne of hydrogen, emits between ten and 12 tonnes of CO₂ for grey hydrogen and 18 to 20 for brown. “Blue” is the same process except the carbon dioxide is supposed to be captured and stored underground. And “green” hydrogen is conventionally defined as generated from splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity. But only 0.04% of hydrogen is green, and blue hydrogen is less than 1%. The rest is grey or brown, most of which is used in oil refineries and for manufacturing ammonia and methanol. It’s an enormous industry which emits more CO₂ than all of Britain and France combined. It is widely hoped that a silver lining of today’s high gas prices will be green hydrogen becoming a cost-competitive alternative to dirty fuels in boilers, shipping tankers and steelworks furnaces. Unfortunately, without electricity market reform, this opportunity is likely to be squandered. And while the buzz around the hydrogen economy intensifies, a closer look suggests the fuel is less a spearhead for a green transition and more the subject of an elaborate bait-and-switch operation by oil companies. Hydrogen’s true colours Green hydrogen is essential for decarbonisation: to replace fossil fuels in steelmaking, ammonia production for fertilisers and possibly shipping and trucking – processes which are difficult to electrify. Some green hydrogen is crosshatched with dirtier hues. So it’s not simply that in its production a lot of energy is wasted in the double transformation from electricity to gas and then fuel. But burning hydrogen also emits nitrogen oxides, air pollutants linked to respiratory illnesses and acid rain. If green hydrogen production is scaled up to play a significant economic role by 2050, its freshwater demand will exceed one-quarter of today’s global annual consumption, risking water scarcity in some regions. Above all, hydrogen is meaningfully green only if the renewable energy that generates it cannot be fed into the grid to replace power from gas or coal plants. Blue hydrogen relies on a similar – but much more harmful – trick of the light. For hydrogen to be true blue, the emissions must be captured and securely stored. In theory, carbon capture and storage works but nearly all plants use the captured carbon to pump more oil and many have been shut down as failures. Only a handful store carbon indefinitely and even these consume lots of energy and capture only some of the CO₂, which can leak. Blue hydrogen’s main source is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is notorious for escaping drilling wells and pipelines. Research suggests that these issues make blue hydrogen worse for the climate than fossil gas. In the EU, as in many economies, electricity pricing is based on the principle of marginal costs, which means that the most expensive source (typically fossil gas) sets the wholesale power price. During sunny or windy spells, a glut of renewable energy generation can slash electricity prices, freeing them from the grip of natural gas prices for a few hours at a time. This is often not enough to justify investments in the electrolysers which produce green hydrogen. Green hydrogen won’t gain the necessary price advantage over blue hydrogen and fossil gas until electricity markets are restructured. Meanwhile, the high price of oil and gas has turbocharged the industry’s expansion. The US government is exhorting oil and fracking firms to “drill baby drill”. Britain’s government is to award more than 100 licenses to drill for oil and gas and colossal new fossil fuel investments have been announced across the Middle East and Africa. In a few years when these new sources come onstream, and particularly if economic growth continues to slow and depress energy demand, gas and oil will become cheaper again – until the next price spike prompts new rounds of investment, and the infernal cycle continues. The owners of newly-built wells, pipelines and terminals will fight to defend those assets and stall decarbonisation. Now fossil-fuel firms are rebranding themselves as agents of “carbon management.” The aim is to prevent their assets from getting stranded by repurposing them, presenting a largely fictional substance, blue hydrogen, as a low-carbon “bridge” to an unspecified green future. Other sectors have joined the oil-led coalition. As the engineer Tom Baxter observes, gas network operators and boiler manufacturers see their survival in this ploy. Utilities are similarly keen, as hydrogen’s inefficiencies allow them to sell more power. Tackling this stalling operation requires public policy. Governments will need to regulate or tax carbon out of the market while simultaneously ramping up renewables. The approach to electricity pricing also needs to shift, to decouple the prices of electricity generated from renewables and fossil gas. The marginal pricing system hugely benefits renewable project owners, since they profit from high electricity prices and effectively zero input costs. An alternative market structure would set rewards for generators according to their average costs plus a slight surplus which could be reinvested into deploying more renewables and other green technologies, providing consumers with cheap electricity. This can only be achieved through a robustly regulated market or by nationalising energy companies and setting prices and production. These interventions would give green hydrogen a competitive advantage over blue or grey variants, one that could be furthered with other subsidies, such as tax credits on the model of the US Inflation Reduction Act. Above all, energy demand must be reduced to ease upward pressure on price. In any future energy system, hydrogen will have a role. But its expansion must be carefully designed, to prevent the promise of green hydrogen disguising the risks of its blue and grey cousins.

The company, which is part of Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance, will begin consultations over 440 redundancies and said it will idle its plant at West Bromwich and convert another in Newport, Wales, into a storage facility. Jobs are also likely to be lost at its Rotherham plant after Liberty said it became “unviable” to produce cheaper steel products, “due to high energy costs and imports from countries without the same environmental standards”. The firm will now focus on steel for defence, energy and aircraft-making clients in a bid to regain profitability. Jeffrey Kabel, Chief Transformation Officer for Liberty Steel Group said: “While our action is expected to regrettably impact the roles of some of our workforce we will provide a level of guaranteed salary and placement opportunities.” He added: “We remain committed to our longer-term growth plans in the UK including our plan to grow Rotherham into a 2 million tonne green steel hub.” Cheap imports from China, where European producers say lax pollution regulations make the material cheaper to make, are squeezing margins on cheaper steel products such as the thick rebar staves used to reinforce concrete in the construction industry. But Britain is also at a disadvantage to European producers, according to UK Steel, the industry group. It estimates that German producers will pay £107 per megawatt hour of electricity in the coming financial year compared to £174 for UK steel mills. Electric furnaces are seen as the future of many UK steel mills as wind power becomes an increasing part of power supply. The steel sector employs 34,500 people directly in the UK and supports a further 43,000 in supply chains. The jobs are often in areas with few other skilled careers and they offer a salary averaging £37,629, 45pc higher than the UK national average. Alun Davies, Community steelworkers' union national officer, said: “This announcement is a body blow to Liberty Steel’s loyal UK workforce, who couldn’t have done more to get the company through an exceptionally challenging period.” Liberty Steel, the UK’s third-largest steel maker after Tata and British Steel, employs 1,900 people in the UK as well as 5,000 contractors. It said Rotherham could lose 185 jobs, while 121 were at risk in Newport, where the company makes thin plates of steel known as hot rolled coil. West Bromwich could lose 99 jobs, and 35 could be lost in Tredegar in South Wales. Both sites make steel tubes. Liberty was hit by the collapse of Greensill Capital from which it borrowed $5bn (£4.1bn). Mr Gupta’s businesses had borrowed from ventures founded by Australian entrepreneur Lex Greensill, which loaned money to companies short term. It collapsed after one of its insurers refused to renew cover. In November, Liberty reached an understanding with creditors to Lex Greensill’s former lending empire including Swiss bank Credit Suisse, in what it called a major step in refinancing the troubled businesses.",Liberty Steel to make over 400 staff redundant as energy costs hammer industry,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/12/liberty-steel-make-400-staff-redundant-energy-costs-hammer-industry/

Thursday saw several developments in Britain’s many industrial disputes as it emerged the ambulance union will meet next week to consider six more strike days. Staff at more than 150 universities across the country are demanding that employers push up their offer of a 3 per cent pay rise after more than a decade of below-inflation increases, the union said. “The clock is now ticking for the sector to produce a deal or be hit with widespread disruption throughout spring,” UCU general secretary Jo Grady said. Meanwhile, around 100,000 civil servants have also decided to go ahead with a walkout next month after failed talks with the government were dismissed as a “total farce”. Doctors’ unions told health secretary Steve Barclay that he must address the “workforce crisis” at a meeting on Thursday, during which there was no movement on pay demands, while a ballot of a teacher’s union failed to meet the threshold for strike action. Talks aimed at resolving the long-running rail dispute were also set to continue following meetings between unions and employers on Thursday. Further ambulance strikes loom as figures showed emergency response times had fallen to their worst on record, with more than one in 10 people left waiting for paramedics for more than three-and-a-half hours after calling, including with serious illnesses such as heart attacks, strokes and sepsis. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of damaging the NHS. Speaking in Belfast, he said: “The most important thing is that these strikes are ended. They will only be ended if the government gets in the room and negotiates and so instead of grandstanding, they need to govern.” Mr Barclay was given a “very clear message” that it would not be enough to focus on next year’s NHS settlement with doctors without a shift on current wages, union leaders said. Representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA), hospital doctors’ union the HCSA, and the British Dental Association (BDA) all met Mr Barclay on Thursday at what was described by both sides as a “constructive” meeting. A strike by 100,000 civil servants will go ahead next month after talks with the government aimed at resolving a bitter dispute over pay, jobs and conditions broke down. Cabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin met with union leaders to discuss growing industrial unrest after weeks of stoppages across the country, including by Border Force staff over Christmas. Unions had made it clear more money would have to be offered to head off an escalation of stoppages. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS), said: “This meeting was a total farce. Despite being well-trailed by the government as a chance to resolve the crisis, it was nothing of the sort because the minister had nothing to offer. “He didn’t deny our members were being offered less than anyone else, he didn’t deny tens of thousands of our members only get a pay rise because of the rise in the national minimum wage but he refused to give us a pay rise now.” Nine out of 10 members of the Nasuwt teachers union in England and Wales voted for strikes over pay but the turnout was 42 per cent, falling short of the 50 per cent legal requirement. Nasuwt general secretary Patrick Roach said the union remains “in formal disputes with ministers and employers and will be continuing to take forward our campaigning for a Better Deal for Teachers. He said: “The readiness of our members to support industrial action demonstrates the anger of the profession and the need for governments in England and Wales to engage in meaningful negotiations to address the deep concerns of our members. “Our campaign to fight for the real-terms pay awards that teachers and headteachers deserve continues.” Leaders of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) met separately with the Rail Delivery Group on Thursday. Both sides said detailed discussions were held and they were working towards a revised offer. Strikes have been held since last summer in the row over pay, jobs and conditions, causing huge disruption to services. No more strikes have been called. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Mick Lynch, RMT general secretary, said: “We have been in detailed discussions with the Rail Delivery Group for the train operating companies. We are working jointly towards a revised offer for their section of the dispute. “We’ve agreed that over the next couple of days we’ll continue to work on that through discussions, and we’ll see what comes of it.” Additional reporting by Press Association.",University staff to walk out for 18 days as ambulance workers consider further strikes,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/strikes-ambulance-trains-nhs-teachers-b2261200.html

The James Hutton Institute has signed construction contracts with McLaughlin & Harvey worth £28.7m for the next stage of the ongoing redevelopment of its Invergowrie estate. This new contract comprises the construction of a combined Advanced Plant Growth Centre (APGC) and international barley hub (IBH). The new building – with the APGC downstairs and the IBH above – will be full of the latest state-of-the-art scientific equipment. This will include computing facilities, imaging technology, sensor-based systems, robotics and controlled environmental cabinets for growing plants. The project, funded by £62m from the Tay Cities Deal, is part of a masterplan to create two institute-led innovation centres at Invergowrie. It will help establish Scotland as a leader in global food security and crop resilience. Enabling works are ongoing on-site. A number of older buildings are being demolished to make way for the new facility. It will be built in the heart of the Invergowrie Campus and is due to be completed in early 2024. A ‘significant milestone’ for £62m project James Hutton Institute chief executive Colin Campbell hailed a “significant milestone” for the project. He added: “It aims to futureproof the barley sector across Scotland and the UK. “This new facility will serve as the key research hub. “It is set to bring around £60 million benefit and over 1,200 jobs to Scotland over the next 10 years.” UK Government Minister for Scotland Malcolm Offord said the facility will support “the future prosperity of our farming industry”. He also welcomed the creation of jobs in the region. Mr Offord said: “The UK Government is investing £45m at the James Hutton Institute through the Tay Cities Deal. “These new facilities will undertake vital research that will support food security and the future prosperity of our farming industry, while also creating new jobs for the region. McLaughlin & Harvey’s operations director Robbie Clark said the firm was delighted to be working on the project. He said: “Having recently completed the state-of-the-art Barley Field Centre facilities, our highly experienced project team will now move seamlessly on to the delivery of the new Advanced Plant Growth Centre and International Barley Hub.” Newly filed accounts for its commercial arm, James Hutton Limited, show it made pre-tax profits of over £600,000 for the year to March 2022.

At first, there is often outrage that the usual supremacy of bosses over workers has been suspended. Preserving such hierarchies is one of Conservatism’s main aims. But then there is sometimes a sense of opportunity: a belief that the strikers and their supporters may fall into a familiar trap, set by decades of anti-union legislation and press propaganda. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have believed that strikes can be used to make Tory governments look tough, and to discredit Labour and the wider left. The succession of aggressive, deliberately provocative anti-strike measures announced over the last six months by the governments of Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and now Rishi Sunak all reflect an assumption that taking on the unions is one of the few remaining strategies that might get the Conservatives re-elected. Yet there is also a third, almost forgotten Tory approach to strikes. Before the Thatcher government, her predecessor as Conservative premier, Edward Heath, faced with strikes that, like today’s, were highly disruptive and yet had considerable public support, was sometimes forced to negotiate and make concessions. As the leader of an unpopular government presiding over a fragile economy that the strikes were weakening further, Heath reluctantly accepted that the unions could not all be beaten. The briefly more constructive tone of some of this week’s talks between ministers and union leaders could be a sign that Sunak, too, will ultimately have to concede at least partial victories to some of the strikers. Like Heath, he is not a dominant or charismatic enough prime minister to change the national conversation about strikes and unions, as Thatcher did. His administration could finally mark the beginning of the end for the version of union-bashing Conservatism she invented, which seems increasingly irrelevant to today’s world of poverty wages and modest union memberships. Alternatively, the industrial relations of Sunak’s premiership could be much messier. Like the party he leads – for now, at least – the prime minister’s political thinking is an unstable, quite possibly unsustainable mix, including a desire to be pragmatic and “reasonable”, a dogmatic belief in markets as the best distributors of economic rewards, and an elite remoteness from ordinary working lives. His government’s attitude to the strikes is to be more conciliatory and more confrontational at the same time. Some strikers may be offered one-off bonuses and better pay rises; others, if they refuse to provide so-far-undefined “minimum service” in sectors from health to education may in future be sacked – despite being participants in walkouts that were democratically agreed and wholly legal when launched. For days now, the government has presented this minimum service legislation as an even-handed measure, to “restore the balance between those seeking to strike and protecting the public from disproportionate disruption”. But claiming that a better “balance” between trade unionists and the public is required – rather than acknowledging that in millions of cases trade unionists and the public are the same people – has been a partisan Tory ploy for decades. British life has been tilted against unions since the 80s. And the Tories have never shown any interest in balancing the relationship between the public and other, more powerful and disruptive, but right-leaning, economic protagonists, such as the City of London. The disingenuous and vaguely worded minimum service bill also echoes recent draconian legislation aimed partly at road-blocking climate activists, “to balance the rights of protesters against the rights of others to go about their daily business”. Sunak may present himself as a centre-right technocrat, but partly out of panic at the mounting opposition to his government and Conservatism in general, he is increasingly ruling as an authoritarian. The government insists it supports the right to strike. The business secretary, Grant Shapps – often selected to try to make extreme policies sound moderate – said on the BBC’s Today programme earlier this week that the “ideal outcome” of the bill would be for the government “to have the power” to set minimum service levels “and never have to use it”, because unions would voluntarily set their own. But this scenario is less reassuring than it was meant to sound. If strikes in much of the economy are required to come with their own strike-breaking operations, of a size dictated directly or indirectly by the government, something fundamental to workplace politics has been altered. It’s possible that the bill may never become law, since it seems to contravene protections for unions in the European convention on human rights. And even if the legislation survives challenges in the courts, the Commons and the Lords, and on the streets (the TUC has announced a “national right to strike day” on 1 February) it may be hard to implement. Minimum service levels will have to be defined for a vast range of different workplaces, and then enforced without sacking too many essential staff or creating too many union martyrs. Yet to focus on such difficulties, enormous though they are, is to miss part of the point of this latest attack on strikers. Like many Tory policies since and including Brexit, the bill is meant to be symbolic and divisive as much as practical, to create bogeymen and energise Tory supporters. If inflation falls as expected between now and the election, and the strikers’ pay claims therefore seem less justified to many voters, then a continuing anti-union culture war might be timely. Without a Thatcher, fresh rightwing ideas or much remaining administrative energy, today’s Tories probably can’t run a reforming government that really hurts the left – but they can pretend. The problem with this impersonation of radicalism, though, is that it requires enough voters to be taken in. And Johnson’s drifting premiership, Truss’s shambolic tenure and now Sunak’s tone-deaf performance in 10 Downing Street have removed the Conservatives’ credibility as a governing party. Even the union-hating press hasn’t given the minimum service bill as much coverage as you might expect, which suggests uncertainty about its significance. Half a century ago, as well as negotiating with unions, Heath’s government also tried to weaken them through legislation. The 1970 industrial relations bill eventually became law despite huge protests. But it was widely flouted, and he lost the next election. If you’re a struggling Tory prime minister, victories on paper over the workers probably won’t save you.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded an increase of 0.1% as the services sector remained in growth despite the soaring cost of living. Experts at the ONS said the slight rise was supported by the technology sector and a strong showing by pubs and bars amid a boost from the winter World Cup in Qatar. It nevertheless represented a slowdown in growth after GDP increased by 0.5% in October. Analysts had predicted the economy would shrink by 0.3% for November. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said: “The economy grew a little in November, with increases in telecommunications and computer programming helping to push the economy forward. “Pubs and bars also did well as people went out to watch World Cup games. “This was partially offset by further falls in some manufacturing industries, including the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, as well as falls in transport and postal, partially due to the impact of strikes. “Over the last three months, however, the economy still shrank – mainly due to the impact of the extra bank holiday for the funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in September.” Consumer-facing industries were the biggest growth driver of the month, witnessing a 0.4% increase amid a lift from higher food and drink sales during the World Cup. The service sector also grew by 0.2% as more punters visited pubs and other venues, although this still reflected a slowdown from a 0.7% rise a month earlier. In November, the construction sector saw growth fall away as it stayed flat for the month following a 0.4% rise in October. Elsewhere, manufacturing was the main cause of a 0.2% decline in the production sector for the period. The ONS added that GDP still contracted by 0.3% over the three months to November despite the latest growth. The economy also declined by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2022 and would therefore enter a technical recession if a further fall is recorded for the final quarter of the year. Economists have suggested that the latest data makes it less clear whether the UK will have entered a recession at the end of last year. Kitty Usher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “This is stronger activity than was expected for November and so will further contribute to the improvement in market sentiment we have seen in the last few weeks. “Given we know the economy also grew in October – albeit driven by a rebound from the period of state mourning – it is no longer certain that the economy will meet the technical definition of a recession when the final data for 2022 is in.” It comes as inflation started to cool down in November, dropping to 10.7% from a 41-year-high of 11.1% a month earlier, and it is expected to drop further through 2023. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said: “We have a clear plan to halve inflation this year – an insidious hidden tax which has led to hikes in interest rates and mortgage costs, holding back growth here and around the world. “To support families through this tough patch, we will provide an average of £3,500 support for every household over this year and next – but the most important help we can give is to stick to the plan to halve inflation this year so we get the economy growing again.” Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow Chancellor, said: “Today’s results are just another page in the book of failure that is the Tory record on growth. “The news of further economic pain will be deeply concerning to families already struggling with the soaring cost of living.”",UK economy unexpectedly grows in November,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/gdp-jeremy-hunt-rachel-reeves-institute-of-directors-b2261459.html

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said pubs and restaurants contributed to growth as people went out to watch World Cup games. However, in the three months to November, the economy shrank by 0.3%. The UK economy had been widely expected to contract in November. But the services sector, which includes a wide-range of industries from hospitality to shopping, was the biggest driver of growth that month. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, told the BBC: ""Business involved in telecoms and computer programmers did okay in November. ""Also interestingly employment agencies did reasonably well and perhaps that reflects those businesses seeking support to fill the vacancies they have which we know from our labour market figures has been an issue in certain sectors.""

They want senior managers at tech firms to face two years in jail if they breach new duties over acceptable content, which includes posts promoting self-harm, depicting sexual violence or facilitating suicide. Labour is expected to support the amendment. Currently the proposed laws would only make bosses criminally liable for failing to give information to media regulator Ofcom and firms would face higher fines. Culture secretary Michelle Donelan has said she is “not ruling out” changes to legislation in the face of the major backbench rebellion. Dame Andrea said in its current form the bill is just asking companies “nicely” to protect children online. She told BBC Radio 4: “There should be this backstop that if you, as a senior tech director, or manager, knowingly allow harm to be caused that results in suicide, pornography, child abuse online and so on. “If you let that happen, there should be a backstop that you can be criminally prosecuted.” Dame Andrea added that in many other businesses, including in the financial and construction sectors, directors will face prosecution if their practices cause significant harm to someone.

The winning bids were revealed in a joint announcement by the UK and Scottish governments. The special economic zones north of the border are being created under a scheme agreed by the two governments. The successful applicants will be able to offer tax incentives and lower tariffs in the zones. A total of five bids for green freeport status were submitted, with North East Scotland, Orkney and Clyde missing out. Each had to set out how they would regenerate their area, create high-quality jobs and support transition to a net-zero economy. The Forth Green Freeport bid was led by Forth Ports, which owns and operates seven ports on the east coast of Scotland. In submitting its bid, Forth Ports said it had the potential to create up to 50,000 new, high-quality jobs in renewable energy, manufacturing, sustainable fuels and construction. Its activities will focus on renewables, advanced manufacturing, alternative fuels, carbon capture utilisation and storage, shipbuilding, logistics and the creative industries. The Opportunity Cromarty Firth consortium - backed by Port of Cromarty Firth, Global Energy Group, Highland Resources and Port of Inverness - said it could create 25,000 jobs. The Inverness and Cromarty Firth bid aims to build a ""world-beating"" floating offshore wind manufacturing sector, with sites in the Cromarty Firth, Invergordon, Nigg and Inverness. Also called free trade zones, freeports are designated areas where the normal tax and tariff rules of the country in which they are based do not apply. They allow goods to be imported, manufactured and re-exported without being subject to checks, paperwork, or import taxes, known as tariffs. This means raw materials can be imported, then engineered into whole products for export. Typically, companies operating in a zone receive tax waivers or tax breaks on National Insurance contributions, Land and Buildings Transactions Tax, business rates and capital allowances. The Scottish ""green freeport"" model includes commitments to meeting net zero targets and supporting fair work practices. The UK government has committed funding of £52m to the project and bidders had to pledge to reach net zero by 2045. Scotland's deputy first minister, John Swinney, described the creation of green freeports as a ""milestone achievement"". He said: ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport and Forth Green Freeport will support businesses to create high-quality, well-paid new jobs, promote growth and regeneration, and make a significant contribution to achieving our net zero ambitions. ""The successful applicants showed a strong determination to embed fair work practices, including payment of the Real Living Wage, and to enshrine net zero initiatives in their work. ""We look forward to working closely with them to ensure they deliver maximum positive impact and become operational as soon as possible."" The UK government's Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said the green freeports would ""undoubtedly be transformative for future generations"". He added: ""Scotland has areas of outstanding opportunity but there are also places that can benefit from more investment to truly level up communities that have been overlooked. ""Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Firth of Forth are fantastic areas for these new green freeports to set up, ensuring the benefits are felt right across Scotland. ""This will help to create exciting new jobs, boost business and encourage investment in the local areas and beyond."" Scottish Renewables said it was pleased that the freeports would have green energy as a focus. Its head of energy transition and supply chain, Emma Harrick, said they would ""help Scotland compete on the international stage as offshore wind develops to become the mainstay of electricity generation in the UK"". The Scottish and UK governments were previously unable to agree plans to establish freeports north of the border, after a number of sites were announced for England. Scottish ministers later said they would pursue an alternative ""green freeport"" model, with additional standards around jobs and climate targets. The SNP's partners in government - the Scottish Greens - do not support the freeports, arguing they are likely to result in ""greenwashing"" rather than genuine action on sustainability. Greens MSP Ross Greer described freeports as a ""Thatcherite gimmick"" and voiced concern about potential abuse by criminals. He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""We've consistently across the world seen freeports attract a lot of criminal activity, particularly money laundering and smuggling, because of the customs arrangements that are in place for them, because they are about deregulation, they are about making it 'easier', particularly for international trade."" Paul Swinney, director of policy research for think tank Centre for Cities, said it remained to be seen how much impact the new freeports would have. He said: ""With freeports, the government has dressed it up as saying we are going to make them into centres of innovation and hotbeds of new ideas. ""But the reality is that the tools that are that on offer make these schemes very attractive to low-skilled businesses rather than high-skilled businesses.""",Cromarty Firth and Forth to host first green freeports,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64248082?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA

Green freeport status for the Cromarty Firth will be a huge asset, driving collaboration between industry, academia and the public sector to stimulate transformational regeneration through economic activity, investment, innovation and skills development. “It will attract large-scale manufacturing and create thousands of green jobs that complement the skills of the local workforce and accelerate Scotland’s and the UK’s progress to achieving net zero targets. “A green freeport will also build on recent significant investments made in ports and harbours across the region and the historic and ongoing strengths here in energy, engineering and life sciences. “It will be a key enabler for supply chains of the future, rapidly accelerating domestic manufacturing capacity in an area with a long-standing industrial heritage. “We very much look forward to our region working in partnership with OCF, as we seek to secure maximum socio-economic impact, not just around the Cromarty Firth and Inverness but throughout many parts of the Highlands and Islands.” Sheelagh Cooley, real estate partner in the Edinburgh office of law firm Shoosmiths, also welcomed the successful bid. She said: “The confirmation of two green freeports in Inverness and Cromarty Firth and the Forth represents an opportunity to drive forward new development, regeneration and economic growth in Scotland. “The potential impact of these projects, however, must not be limited to the immediate vicinity of the green freeports. Rather, true success hinges on the ability to also revitalise surrounding towns and cities, many of which are economically deprived. “In Inverness and Cromarty Firth, the introduction of a green freeport is said to have the potential to unlock £2.5bn of new private sector investment – creating up to 25,000 jobs. This is alongside developing wind power technology, with its port facilities already supporting offshore wind projects. “While the introduction of green freeports is governed by UK legislation, the model’s legislative structure is subject to devolved and reserved powers. The sites are intended to be secure custom zones where business can be carried out inside a land border, but where different custom and tax rules apply - offering various regulatory and financial incentives. “From a planning perspective, the green freeports are likely to operate under extended permitted development rights. Combined with a streamlining of the consenting process for development, this type of relaxed planning regime could, in theory, allow schemes – residential, commercial and infrastructure - to be brought forward at speed and avoiding certain barriers. “Unlike the UK government’s freeport model, and investment zone proposals, Scottish green freeports are subject to additional requirements, including on carbon neutrality and paying the real Living Wage. “The Forth green freeport could act as a catalyst for the manufacture of offshore wind turbines, shipbuilding and energy systems. It encompasses several ports, industrial and logistics sites, as well as Edinburgh Airport, with the consortium behind the bid outlining that it could lead to a boom in job creation and economic growth that is rooted in renewable energy and decarbonisation. “The successful bidders will now work with the Scottish and UK Government to determine a governance structure for each site. A process that must balance deregulation and economic growth with protecting the environment and assisting the transition to net zero. “Subject to compliance with the regulatory controls, green freeports should provide a welcome opportunity for growth in the Scottish economy, especially in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors.” Dr Liz Cameron CBE, Chief Executive, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, also welcomed the award. She said: “It is great news for Scottish business that the UK and Scottish Governments have finally confirmed the sites of the two winning bids. It’s important now that both governments act swiftly to ensure that the successful sites are operational at the earliest opportunity, we are all competing to attract investment and trade. “Whilst it will be very disappointing for those areas who were not successful, we would urge both governments to now consider, in partnership with the business community, other incentives and initiatives which could be developed from the innovation demonstrated by the other bidders.” Professor Chris O’Neil, principal and chief executive of UHI Inverness, said: “The awarding of Green Freeport status to Inverness and Cromarty Firth will have a transformative impact on the economic fortunes of the community we serve. ""We are poised, together with our UHI partners, to meet the subsequent skills and knowledge demand. “We have the expertise in engineering, research, technology, design and construction to provide a highly-skilled and aspirational workforce, including trainees, apprentices, graduates and researchers. “As well as being well-placed to meet the associated need for talent, we also have the established industry links and capacity for knowledge exchange to make valuable collaborative contributions to the creation of a global green hub. “Our talented and committed students have proved their resilience by studying while coping with the consequences of a pandemic and then a cost-of-living crisis, and this announcement is significant in that it represents an improved future and enhanced opportunities for many of them. “Current and upcoming students will complete their learning journey knowing there is the potential for attractive employment on our doorstep in an expanding industry. These prospects will help retain local talent and will also appeal to a generation of students who are environmentally conscious and willing to embrace a sector that supports their values.” Do you want to respond to this article?

Josh Self,87322068,https://www.politics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PA-68183790.jpg,en,2023-01-13 16:13:37,-0.024,GB,"Rishi Sunak is a hyper-aware, even self-conscious prime minister. Since taking post in October, he has worked assiduously to present a “slick” image to the media, undertaken multiple U-turns to halt backbench rebellions and tried at every turn to position himself positively against Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer. The tricky technocrat in No 10 is obsessed with good press. It is an approach that bares stark contrast to the days of Liz Truss, who showed little concern for how her policies might be received amid her deeply misguided ideological crusade. Unlike his predecessor, therefore, you can take for granted that when Sunak announces a new policy, there will be a hefty amount of calculated politicking involved. In this way, November’s Autumn Statement was strategically orientated to exploit traditional Conservative strengths and traditional Labour weaknesses. Sir Keir, ever-keen to present Labour as a responsible party after the Cobrynite experiment, was challenged to disagree with Sunak’s proposals. In the end, Labour’s inability to sign up wholeheartedly to the new fiscal orthodoxy exposed, in chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s analysis, a deficit of common sense in Labour ranks. When it comes to the government’s new anti-strike bill, the political thinking is essentially the same. Setting a trap… The new anti-strike legislation was introduced to the House on Tuesday by business secretary Grant Shapps. Citing risks posed to NHS patients, Shapps outlined that the new bill would require public sector services to run minimum levels of provision on strike days — essentially forcing a certain proportion of an industry to work or face the sack. The move harks back to a “golden age” of Conservative power over industrial relations. Ever since Margaret Thatcher defeated the miners and other unions in the 1980s, Conservatives have viewed strikes as a way to make their party look tough and discredit the Labour Party alongside the wider left. To be sure, we have already seen Starmer encounter some political difficulty in this latest wave of industrial action. In the summer, he chose to sack one-time frontbencher Sam Tarry for standing alongside picketing workers. For the Labour leader — intent on distancing his party from the unions — Tarry had crossed a very literal red line. But even if Starmer wants to downplay the connection, there is no escaping the fact that the Labour party is associated politically and financially with the trade union movement. With the new anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak hopes to implicate Labour in an upsurge of union militancy, thus slowing Starmer’s inexorable march towards Downing Street. It was telling that ministers chose to announce the new strike legislation within hours of the Labour leader’s “New year, New Vision” speech last week. Shapps’ pledge stole Starmer’s limelight and Labour’s newly announced “take back control bill” secured a grand total of zero newspaper front pages the following day. The politics of the new legislation also dominated Starmer’s post-speech press conference. Under a barrage of questioning, the Labour leader confirmed that his party will vote against the plans and repeal the Act if he takes power at the next election. It was all going to plan for Sunak. He had goaded Starmer out of hiding and forced the Labour leader to share an ideological platform with that favourite Conservative bogeyman: the so-called union “baron”. The PMQs’ attack lines wrote themselves. However, few would deny that the prime minister is playing a high-stakes political game with his new anti-strike bill. Although Starmer’s reaction could be accounted for, the government risks running into a hostile public backlash. Now a week on from when the legislation was announced, and many view the new proposals as needlessly and deliberately obstructive. Risk 1: The government is viewed as needlessly obstructive Although Conservative MPs imagine Mick Lynch as the new Arthur Scargill, the infamous union “baron” who led opposition to Margaret Thatcher, the general public is not so convinced. Instead, the political posturing around the new anti-strike bill may be viewed as deepening the industrial relations crisis and prolonging our winter of discontent. Furthermore, the new bills’ parliamentary progress is set to be slow, with a difficult House of Lords stage beckoning. And when/if the bill does eventually pass, its key provisions will unquestionably be tested in the courts before they can take effect, just as is the case with deportations to Rwanda. So with the proposed legislation unlikely to do anything to solve urgent disputes, the public may well wonder want the point is at all — if not to be deliberately coercive and punitive. Risk 2: Labour exploits support for striking nurses Another risk for Sunak is that by focussing on risks posed to NHS patients during the strikes, he ventures onto territory where the Labour Party is traditionally at its strongest. It is telling that Starmer has focused his attacks on the part of the bill which would allow employers to sack workers who defy a “work notice” by striking. At PMQs on Wednesday, Starmer accused the government of going from “clapping the nurses to sacking the nurses”. On Thursday came a new widely-shared graphic by order of Labour Party HQ, which accused Sunak of planning to give striking nurses “the finger”, Alan Sugar-style. This attack line works because it is not very far from the truth. As a result of the proposed law, individual nurses could be prosecuted and even jailed. These are the same people Sunak was pictured clapping for, as chancellor, throughout the pandemic. Risk 3: Sunak is viewed as a rigid, uncompromising ideologue Sunak’s desire to be seen as pragmatic and “reasonable” may be fundamentally undermined by the passage of this bill. In pursuing the new legislation, Sunak has abandoned his “managerialism” and political prudence, territory where the risk-averse Starmer is comfortable, in order to set up a battle over principles, territory where Starmer is not. Honing in on fundamental Labour-Conservative differences in a bid to exploiting the Labour leader’s risk-averse nature, Sunak hence risks exposing the worst aspects of Conservative ideology. While the prime minister may point to a more conciliatory tone in negotiations, there is no hiding that the new law is an act of explicitly Thatcherite homage. It is as provocative and divisive as much as practically possible, drawing on Conservatism’s collective memory of disputes in the 1980s. However, you cannot help but think that in picking a fight with NHS nurses, Sunak has chosen the wrong moment to abandon his “problem-solving” priorities and get dug in with Conservative dogma. One recent YouGov poll found that 64% of the public support the striking nurses. Rather than introducing anti-strike legislation, therefore, Sunak’s political future may be better served by getting around the negotiating table and constructively ending the industrial dispute once and for all. So with imagery of nurses in handcuffs circling — and with ordinary Britons desperate for some degree of normalcy to return, Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes looks destined to fail.",Week-in-Review: Sunak’s attempt to trap Starmer on strikes is destined to fail,https://www.politics.co.uk/week-in-review/2023/01/13/week-in-review-sunaks-attempt-to-trap-starmer-on-strikes-is-destined-to-fail/

As energy experts focused on how data can be used in the transition to a low-carbon economy, we have closely followed how this volatility has played out in Britain. Full data for the year 2022 is now available and here are a few things we have noticed. Britain (we talk about Britain and not the UK, as Northern Ireland is part of an integrated Irish electricity grid) saw a 4% drop in electricity demand from 2021 – that’s the third largest year-on-year reduction after 2008 (caused by the shock of the global financial crash) and pandemic-affected 2020. It takes Britain’s overall electricity demand back to values last seen in the 1980s, an 18% reduction from its peak in 2005. This time two years ago, we stated that COVID lockdowns meant electricity demand would never be so low again. We got it wrong. In fact, 2022 was the lowest year by some margin (2% lower than 2020). We believe the main factors for this drop were the significant increase in prices, the wider media attention on this, and the wider cost of living crisis. From importer to exporter The earliest undersea high-voltage direct current cable (known as an interconnector) from Britain to another country’s power grid was laid in 1961 across the Strait of Dover to France. In the years since, another seven have been constructed: two to Ireland, one to Belgium, one to the Netherlands, one to Norway and a further two to France. More interconnectors are under construction or proposed, including a connection with Denmark due to go live at the end of 2023. Since 1978, Britain has always used these cables to import more electricity than it exported over a given year. Over the past decade, an average of 5% of the country’s electricity has been imported, helping to reduce the amount it needed to generate itself. However, net imports swung to net exports in 2022 for the first time in 44 years. Looking at the individual interconnectors, it was the link to France that caused this significant change. In 2021, there were 14 terawatt-hours (TWh) of net imports from France whereas in 2022, there were 10 TWh to France. This is an enormous swing of 24 TWh from a single point of connection, and represents the largest annual change in a single electricity source since the shift from coal to gas in 2015/16. To put 24 TWh in context, this is broadly similar to the amount of electricity Scotland uses each year, or the annual output from Britain’s onshore wind generation. So what happened? Over the past year, French nuclear power stations had many maintenance problems which led to significant reductions in their output. In August, 57% of the country’s generation capacity was not being used. Despite a modest recovery, as of January 2023, 15 of its 56 reactors were closed for repairs. All this meant nuclear-reliant France had to import electricity from neighbouring countries. This led to more electricity being generated in Britain than would otherwise have been the case, to satisfy the additional demand from France. So while Britain’s renewable generation was at a record level, its fossil fuel generation was also higher than in the previous year. Without the problems in France, 2022 could have been the first year that Britain’s wind, solar and hydro combined generated more electricity than its fossil fuels – a milestone that will happen anyway over the next couple of years. Wind is cheap, but your electricity isn’t Wind generation also recovered from its relatively poor output in 2021 to reach a record generation of 77 TWh. That’s a 24% increase on the preceding year, when capacity increased by just 11%. This sudden increase highlights the year-to-year variations that need to be planned for to have a robust and resilient decarbonised power system, including longer duration energy storage. Renewables (including generation from biomass) contributed nearly 40% of Britain’s total generation in 2022. This progress, along with the lower demand for electricity within Britain, meant emissions from the power sector were broadly similar to previous years (though would have been lower if imports from France had continued). The rising prices of electricity and gas have contributed to a cost of living crisis, putting millions in fuel poverty. And though renewables and nuclear together provided over half of Britain’s electricity in 2022, the system is still overwhelmingly influenced by prices set by fossil fuel plants. Reforms are urgently needed here to decouple the price of low-carbon electricity from that of fossil fuels.",Britain is a net electricity exporter for first time in 44 years,https://theconversation.com/britain-is-a-net-electricity-exporter-for-first-time-in-44-years-197506

The Bank of England, the Office for Budget Responsibility, the BBC's Today programme and the rest of the doomsters may be convinced that we face some terrible economic apocalypse. But the facts refuse to oblige. Confounding all expectations, output in Britain grew by 0.1pc in November, leading financial analyst across the City to upgrade forecasts. That means we're not in a recession after all. And it could get even better when we see the official December data. In spite of all the doom and gloom about a disastrous seasonal shopping season British consumers did what they do best and opened their wallets. The result? Retail sales soared — right in the midst of the 'cost of living crisis'. Growth in November was driven by the UK's resilient services sector — everything from haircuts and shopping malls to the banks and legal services of the City, as well as entertainment and communications. It accounts for nearly 79 per cent of our national output. (Construction was flat, hindered by rising interest rates, while manufacturing dipped.) So in spite of months of bad news from Downing Street in the form of tax hikes and budget cuts — as well as a seemingly never-ending stream of headlines about soaring energy bills, rampant inflation and relentless strike actions — Christmas 2022 brought excellent economic news. From the high street to the retail park, sales were brisk. Shopping boomed across the country, with almost every category in the sector — be it supermarket groceries, beauty products at Boots, or Nike Air Force trainers — keeping the tills rattling throughout the festive period. Marks & Spencer, far from being the busted flush of popular imagination, saw turkeys and sparkling wine help to deliver a 6.3 per cent gain in sales through its food halls. Mid-market Sainsbury's, thought to be a victim of competition from German value retailers Aldi and Lidl, also defied the odds with a 7.1 per cent rise in sales over Christmas. High street giants Tesco, Next and Lidl have all done impressively, too. as have local favourites Greggs and Boots. Corks were also popping at the UK's biggest wine retailer Majestic, where price cuts brought shoppers through the doors in droves. Stunningly, sales were 21.1 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. JD Sports, meanwhile, recorded a 20 per cent lift in sales over the holiday period, driven by 2.6 million pairs of Nike trainers. But it's not just shops. In aviation, passenger numbers at Heathrow were up 90 per cent on the 2021 festive period — when the Omicron variant of Covid-19 blighted festive getaways — defying industrial action by border staff. Elsewhere, in spite of this week's aborted Virgin Orbit launch in Cornwall, the UK's space sector is booming, with Germany's Rocket Factory Augsburg signing a multi-year partnership for a planned launch on the Shetland Islands. The industry generates £16.5 billion of income. And, in another boost, this week's news of a gas find in the southern North Sea by a Shell-led consortium has been hailed as 'fantastic'. The good tidings continue. The Office for National Statistics reported this week that, in 2021, UK output per hour worked 'had the fastest growth of the G7 countries'. Not something likely to lead BBC headlines. Banking giant JP Morgan Chase says that about three-quarters of its mid-size UK business leaders (the backbone of our economy) plan to grow their enterprises this year — and have no plans to shed jobs. So, when all this is accounted for, and despite all the dire talk from the Bank of England and others about the longest recession in our history, things could be turning out far better than expected. And saying this matters. Because drumbeats of bad economic forecasts can fast become self-perpetuating, ramping up the gloom and helping to delay our recovery. Even Doomster-in-Chief — Chancellor Jeremy Hunt — now believes that the economic slow-down will be milder than forecast. So why isn't he — and, indeed, our glum Prime Minister — leading by example and shouting the positive news from the rooftops? After all, it is the Conservative Party's 'energy price guarantee' on people's bills (established under the Liz Truss debacle and largely embraced by Sunak and Hunt), along with targeted help for the poorest families unveiled by Sunak when he was still at the Treasury, that together have taken the sting out of household gas and electricity costs. And that's in addition to the recent sharp fall in the price of wholesale gas, as a result of the extraordinarily mild European winter — one of the warmest in half a century. This has reduced demand and lowered tariffs, further helping to cut the cost of living. Yet despite these successes, Nos 10 and 11 have echoed the pessimistic economists who were still insisting at the end of last year that consumers as well as retailers were bound to suffer badly this winter. The British Retail Consortium's Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said in early December that 'the cost of living crisis means many families might dial back their festive plans'. She could not have been more wrong. It's clear then that, while cost pressures are real, people have not stopped spending. How is this possible? Amid the purported misery, it seems families are still determined to enjoy themselves. My view is that the soothsayers have underestimated two post-pandemic factors. That big savings balances approaching £200 billion, built-up during the pandemic, have been sitting around ready to be spent. And that, ahead of the holidays, fewer credit cards had been swiped to their limits than in previous years. The British Retail Consortium continues to warn that because of further rises in the cost of living, retailers face headwinds in 2023. Maybe so. But inflation is forecast to fall dramatically, wholesale gas prices have tumbled and the employment market remains strong, with more than 1 million vacancies. The pessimism is being overdone. There is still some way to go, but that should not preclude our leaders hailing the resilience of the British consumer, or the skill with which industries across the board managing their way through difficult times.

The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said the new strike days are in addition to the previously announced 16-day programme of rolling strike action, set to begin in schools across the country next week. The EIS Executive Committee met on Friday and agreed action that will include two days of strikes in all schools and sectors on February 28 and March 1, followed by a rolling programme of strikes for 20 days between March 13 and April 21. Each local authority area will be impacted by three consecutive days of strikes, with one day affecting all schools bookended on either side by one-day strikes in primary and secondary schools. EIS members have previously taken three days of strikes, one in November and two in January, in the continuing campaign for a fair pay settlement for the year 2022. Primary and secondary schools were closed on Tuesday January 10 and Wednesday January 11 after last-ditch talks with the Scottish Government failed. Unions have demanded a 10% pay increase but the Scottish Government has offered 5%, including rises of up to 6.85% for the lowest-paid staff. Speaking after the meeting of EIS Executive Committee, general secretary Andrea Bradley said: “The programme of additional strike action, agreed today, is a direct response to the inaction of the Scottish Government and Cosla (Convention of Scottish Local Authorities) on teacher pay. “After a year of dither, delay and disingenuity from the Scottish Government and Cosla, Scotland’s teachers have simply had enough.” Ms Bradley added: “The recent days of strike action by Scotland’s teachers have succeeded in bringing Cosla and the Scottish Government back to the negotiating table but they have yet to put a single extra penny onto that table. “Scotland’s teachers rejected a sub-inflationary 5% offer six months ago, and little or no progress has been made in negotiations since. “The prospect of 22 additional days of strike action, on top of the 16 days of rolling action set to begin next week, should signal clearly to the Scottish Government and Cosla that they must now act with urgency. “Our members are resolute and determined to secure a fair pay settlement, which both properly reflects their value and also takes account of the soaring cost of living.” Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “Strikes in our schools are in no one’s interest – including for pupils, parents and carers who have already had to deal with significant disruption over the past three years. “It is disappointing that the EIS has proceeded to escalate industrial action – we are continuing to urge teaching unions to reconsider their plans while talks are ongoing. “Recent discussions have been constructive. There has been a shared understanding that talks have been focused on discussing potential areas for compromise – not on tabling a new offer at this stage. “To date we have made four offers, all of which have been rejected, but we remain absolutely committed to reaching an agreement on a pay deal that is fair and sustainable for all concerned.”",Teaching union announces 22 more days of strike action in Scotland,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-government-scotland-children-education-secretary-b2261914.html

Ministers have accused workers of putting lives at risk during strikes. In response, Downing Street said it ""greatly valued"" ambulance workers and the ""door remains open"" for talks. GMB represent more than 10,000 ambulance workers who went on strike on Wednesday across nine ambulance services in England and Wales. Steve Rice, writing on behalf of the GMB Ambulance Committee, said he was ""appalled"" at recent government statements and accused ministers of attempting to remove workers' right to strike . He wrote: ""We feel utterly betrayed by the way your government has singled out ambulance workers as part of a crude attempt to remove our right to strike. ""You and your ministers should be ashamed of the way you have tried to paint us as uncaring about safety standards -nothing could be further from the truth. ""We want a constructive relationship with government - to talk about pay and seriously improve conditions throughout the ambulance service. But you are making us and our ambulance colleagues feel demonised."" Mr Rice concludes: ""please talk to us and stop attacking us."" The letter comes after the prime minister described the industrial action as ""terrifying"". He told the Commons on Wednesday: ""What is terrifying is that right now people do not know whether, when they call 999, they will get the treatment they need."" Business Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs that ""a lack of timely co-operation"" from unions was ""putting their constituents' lives at risk."" Responding to the GMB letter, Downing Street said the health secretary's door remains open to talks with unions and it has accepted the independent pay review body's recommendation to give one million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year.

Mr Sunak said he hoped to ""find a way through"" the deadlock with unions to avert further industrial action and touted the minimum service level legislation. The Bill is due to considered by MPs again on Monday.

Astrologists predict it will be a year of hope as the rabbit is a symbol of longevity, peace and prosperity in Chinese culture. The prospect of a better year ahead is certainly something investors in the region will be hoping for. China had a difficult 2022 with tightening tech sector regulations, a property building crisis that curbed investment, and strict Covid-19 restrictions that dampened consumption. As a result, growth levels achieved in the year will likely be significantly below the annual target of 5.5%. At the end of last year Chinese authorities offered some “hope” for growth by terminating its three years of zero-Covid restrictions and lifting almost all constraints that damaged the property sector. These coordinated policy responses led economists to increase their GDP forecasts for the year ahead, with China likely to be the only major economy to grow faster in 2023 than in 2022 (the forecasted growth rate is 4.8 per cent in 2023, against 3% for last year). At the upcoming National People’s Congress in March the government may decide to set a growth target of 5% for 2023. The target needs to be ambitious enough to boost confidence, particularly when growth is deteriorating in many regions. But it must also remain realistic to avoid two consecutive years of growth disappointment. One area of concern is a surge in Covid-19 cases. Since restrictions have been lifted there has been an exponential rise in infections. While accurate data is hard to source, a number of local governments have estimated 60-85% of their population contracted Covid-19 in December. As this wave of infections escalates – with people moving around the country for the Lunar New Year – it will put enormous strain on already pressured hospitals, particularly as medical shortages continue across major cities. The faster-than-expected easing of restrictions will therefore initially be disruptive to the recovery, as shown by recent economic indicators. Nevertheless, with Covid-19 restrictions removed and with continued support for the property market, the Chinese economy should accelerate in the second quarter of the year, especially if the current wave of infections subsides, allowing activity to pick up. That said, a repeat of the V-shaped recovery seen in 2021 after the initial Covid-19 shock should not be expected as the property market will take longer to recover and gain investor confidence. What about inflation? Many economies around the world have had to deal with spiralling inflation throughout 2022, albeit China is the outlier with the most recent consumer price index in December rising at 1.8% (year-on-year). As China advances the easing of Covid restrictions, inflation will potentially accelerate due to pent-up demand and government growth policies. It could easily accelerate beyond the official target of 3% in 2023, similar to what happened in other major economies after reopening. Chinese households are cash rich, demand will be tilted towards consumption, and a decent rebound in retail sales is likely, given the last print in November was a decline of 5.9% (year-on-year). There are already signs of this pent-up demand as bookings for international travel have surged. China re-opening will undoubtedly cause higher inflation, and many western central bankers will be wary of this. However, the impact of that re-opening should have limited impact on global inflation. Whilst there will also be a need for more energy from China; Chinese imports of crude oil and liquefied natural gas are already back to pre-pandemic levels. China is a large consumer of commodities and there has already been a surge in iron ore, up more than 40% since bottoming in late October 2022. Any further resurgence in commodities will depend heavily on how China stimulates the economy, and it is somehow difficult to envisage a resurgence in construction in the short term, which should limit commodity upside. Ultimately the speed of easing of coronavirus restrictions has surprised many, and it seems China is prioritising growth above all else. In terms of prosperity at least, the Year of the Rabbit may well bring some welcome respite.

In an open letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the GMB union urges the Government to “talk to us and stop attacking us”. It comes after Mr Sunak described the widespread industrial action as “terrifying” as the Government introduced the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill to Parliament, which would set minimum service levels for health, fire, education, transport, nuclear decommissioning and border security services. He told the Commons on Wednesday: “What is terrifying is that right now people do not know whether, when they call 999, they will get the treatment they need.” Writing to Mr Sunak on behalf of the GMB Ambulance Committee, Steven Rice accused ministers of trying to “remove our right to strike”. “We feel utterly betrayed by the way your Government has singled out ambulance workers as part of a crude attempt to remove our right to strike,” he wrote. “You and your ministers should be ashamed of the way you have tried to paint us as uncaring about safety standards – nothing could be further from the truth. “We want a constructive relationship with government – to talk about pay and seriously improve conditions throughout the ambulance service. But you are making us and our ambulance colleagues feel demonised.” Downing St told the BBC the Health Secretary is open to talks with unions and it has accepted the independent pay review body’s recommendation to give one million NHS workers a pay rise of at least £1,400 this year. A spokesperson added: “However, we must keep the public safe, which is why we are introducing minimum service and safety levels across a range of sectors to ensure that lives and livelihoods are not lost.” On Friday, Mr Sunak said he hopes to “find a way through” the deadlock with unions to avert further industrial action. He told broadcasters during a trip to Scotland: “I think with strikes it’s important that we remain in strong dialogue with the unions, that’s why the Government invited all union leaders in to have those discussions. “The discussions are ongoing and hopefully we can find a way through.”",Ambulance staff say they feel ‘demonised’ by Government,https://www.independent.co.uk/business/ambulance-staff-say-they-feel-demonised-by-government-b2262090.html
