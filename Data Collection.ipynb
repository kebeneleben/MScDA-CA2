       "  'title': 'Property-sector deals to retreat from near-record €5.5bn levels of last year',\n",
       "  'text': 'Property experts are expecting the level of investment sales in 2023 to fall short of the near record €5.5bn seen in 2022. Adrian Trueickof Knight Frank expects that the value could fall back to between €3.5 and €4bn.“The first quarter and into the second quarter will be quiet as there will be a reluctance to put properties on the market in case it may not sell and as investors wait and see when interest rates will stabilise and where prices will bottom out. Most of the sales will be in the second half of next year,” he said.Kevin Donohue of Cushman & Wakefield concurs: “The first few months of the year will likely see investment volumes fall as ongoing price discovery takes place, however, with the weight of equity seeking deployment we expect to see activity increase in the latter half of the year.”Key factors which are likely to curtail the value of deals are that investors are not expecting the larger deals that were seen in 2022, especially not on the scale of Brookfield’s purchase of Hibernia Reit with its portfolio of prime Dublin offices and development properties for €1.089bn There may also be few deals at around the €500m level which Blackstone paid in 2022 for Spencer Place, in Dublin’s north docklands, developed by Johnny Ronan and sold by Fortress Capital.Other factors, according to Mr Donohue include ongoing uncertainty around the war in Ukraine, inflation, persistent supply chain issues, rising interest rates and occupier market concerns.All are “impacting investor sentiment”, he said. “No more so than in the office investment sector and whilst significant capital continues to exist for deployment, a period of price discovery is underway as both buyers and sellers reassess their expectations.”Another factor which will curtail 2023 activity will be a stand-off between sellers and buyers.The former will be hoping to achieve prices closer to peaks while the latter will be aiming to beat them down to achieve bargains.Savills agree that equity capital is actively “seeking to be deployed into property assets. Furthermore, debt is still also available, albeit more expensive and difficult to access. This means that pricing is the only inhibitor to transactions, as opposed to a lack of investor demand.”Developers with energy-efficient newer buildings will be looking for a green premium according to Niall Gargan of JLL as he expects investors and occupiers to participate in a flight to quality. A JLL survey shows 90pc of the top 10 Dublin office occupiers have made a commitment to upgrade the properties they occupy.“On the other hand, prices for older less energy-efficient properties are expected to sell at a brown discount.”The term takes its name from brownfield sites and they could well include late ‘noughties’ office blocks which may present opportunities for refurbishment or redevelopment. As the purchasers will have to offset construction cost inflation and higher interest rates as well as the risks relating to the uncertainty in the occupier markets, they will haggle for prices that are well below what energy efficient properties sell for.Some investors may look at an older office in a prime location and consider that should they achieve a 30pc discount on prime office prices, then the brown property would look attractive as a development play.“I would prefer to buy the worst building on a prime location than the best building in the worst location,” explains Michele Jackson of TWM.While there were examples of a couple of west Dublin offices being earmarked for conversion to flats, she doesn’t expect that to happen except for a small number in suburbia which are outside established business parks.Iain Sayer, director HWBC, expects demand for residential and large logistics properties to continue to be backed by rental growth in those sectors and the agent is active in filling the funding gap to develop schemes “to feed the strong investor and occupier demand for standing assets”.However, he points out that “equity raising markets have become more challenging as investors seek greater reward for their capital”. \"This will have the effect of reducing appetite for development projects as target returns can be met from less risky activities,” he said. “Investors have no motivation to take on the expense and risk of the dysfunctional planning system and rising construction costs when good returns can be made from standing assets.”Price reductions will be reflected in the extension of yields and Mr Gargan expects these to increase by 25 basis points for both prime offices, out to 4.5pc, and prime residential investments out to 4pc by December 2023.But Colm Lauder, analyst with Goodbody stockbrokers, expects sharper re-pricing moves for Dublin over the next year, with prime yields moving toward 5pc, which would imply a further 18-20pc to come off capital values as the new rates environment is gradually priced in.“However, this is at the prime, Grade A, and most energy-efficient end of the Dublin office market, and moves are likely to be wider for older stock with weaker sustainability credentials. In fact, with a declining new stock pipeline, we are generally comfortable with rents for the newest, greenest Dublin offices, and even see capacity for growth in 2024 – once the current tech sector woes are stabilised – which will help offset some of the yield-driven valuation declines.” He also points out that the residential investment market has the best operational fundamentals. “Ireland remains woefully undersupplied of rental stock, and accelerated Government interference through 2022 has dampened supply, as reflected in figures for the declines in apartment commencements and completions,” he said.He also points to issues which are curtailing new supply such as planning uncertainty, introduction of an eviction ban, tightening of rent controls and regulatory changes for funds and says these will add to pressure on market rents.“This all means that for those with standing assets, operational, and thus income, performance is strong. Letting-up periods are a fraction of underwrite expectations, vacancy is negligible and rents continue to grow in line with rental pressure zone caps. However, challenges are growing on the capital side of the investment equation. The inability to lift rents as input costs rise, particularly financing costs, means developers are often unable to maintain viability. This means entry yields, which are currently around 4pc in Dublin, need to rise, resulting in an inevitable dampening in capital values.”In contrast a shortage of prime stock is curtailing opportunities in the industrial and logistics sector.However, Mr Lauder believes industrial yields will be susceptible to international trends. Irish logistics yields continued to trend lower despite rising rates, a trend he attributes to the improving quality of stock.“Looking forward, we expect prime Dublin industrial and logistics yields to move over 5.75pc as rate moves are priced in, and developers look to maintain margins as input costs rise. This would imply capital values softening by 18-20pc over the next year, though again this can be buffered by market rents rising for the best assets.”But Mr Gargan disagrees, saying that prime industrial at 4.25pc and prime retail investments at 4.5pc will see yields holding steady. An exception may be shopping centres where they could move out to 6pc.Mr Donohue says that the retail market appears for now to have bucked the trend as this year’s concerns have not impacted it to the same degree as they affected offices.“There are a number of reasons which include the occupier market performing strongly across the high street, shopping centres and retail parks sectors, as well as the investment market showing strong activity during 2022, with a number of shopping centre and retail parks transacting.“The rise in debt costs has not impacted yields as severely as in the office sector primarily due to yields for assets already having gone through a period of softening during Covid-19. However, with the current high inflation, consumer spending is declining and could lead to a slowdown in occupier demand.”Among the major properties expected to sell in 2023 are Fibonacci Square, the 34,838 sqm (375,000sqft) office space which Johnny Ronan’s RGRE is developing in Ballsbridge, Dublin 4. reported that Pontegadea, the family firm of Amancio Ortega, founder of the Zara fashion retail chain, had agreed to pay Fortress Capital about €525m for the property. That’s a reduction of €25m on previous reports.It is let to Mark Zuckerberg’s social media giant Meta which has indicated that it will seek to sub-let the space which it will not need due to cutbacks on staff recruitment.Also expected to sell in 2023 is One Warrington Place, a landmark six-storey office block near Mount Street Bridge and overlooking the Grand Canal in Dublin city.Irish Life Investment Managers has asked JLL to fetch €55m for the 56,000 sqft offices. It is fully let to Bord Gáis at a rent which would equate to a net initial yield of about 5pc.Irish Life bought it in 2014 for €42m from Northwood Investors who are reported to have purchased it in 2012 for €27m.Another office block, The Hive, in Sandyford Business district is being sold by Colony Capital and agents HWBC are quoting €34.4m. Occupiers include NTR PLC and Cubic Telecom.Also Credit Suisse is seeking around €24m for the Chancery Building, a modern office premises near Dublin Castle and a separate block providing four apartments.The 3,185 sqm of offices are let under long-term leases to OPW, Wella and Data Analytics producing a rental income of €1,505,621. Mr Trueick of Knight Frank says this would equate to a 5.50pc NIY. It also comes with planning permission for a further office floor.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Ireland’s property market proved to be resilient to cost-of-living fears and external pressures throughout last year, a new report has said. The MyHome.ie quarterly house price report found the market had held up better than evidence had suggested in 2022.The number of vendors cutting asking prices remained at low levels, while house prices were being settled above asking prices.However, the report warned that the resilience of the housing marking is set to be tested this year. The report found annual asking price inflation slowed to 6% nationwide, and was 3.6% in Dublin and 7.6% elsewhere around the country.Meanwhile, the report found quarterly asking price inflation dropped by 0.4% nationally, by 0.8% in Dublin, and by 0.2% elsewhere around the country.Asking prices for the average home in the Republic rose almost 11 per cent to 320,000 euro in the 12 months to June, it says.It means the asking prices for the average home in Ireland is now 330,000 euro, while the price in Dublin is 436,000 euro and elsewhere around the country it is 283,000 euro.There were 15,000 available properties for sale on MyHome.ie in the fourth quarter of the year – an improvement on the same time last year but still below pre-pandemic levels.Average time to sale agreed was 2.7 months nationwide which the report said is indicative of a very tight housing market.Average mortgage approval in October was 280,600 euro – up 4.3% on the year.Residential property market transactions are set to exceed 21 billion euro in 2022, a rise of 7.5% in volume terms compared with 2021.The average residential transaction in the third quarter of last year was 370,000 euro, almost eight times the average income of 48,000 euro which is the highest multiple in over a decade.The report said it expects to see 28,400 houses completions in 2022, exceeding its previous forecast of 26,500 units completed.The author of the report, Conall MacCoille, chief economist at stockbrokers Davy, said it appeared the market had held up better than evidence had suggested.“The number of vendors cutting their asking prices is still at low levels. Also, transactions in Q4 were still being settled above asking prices, indicative of a tight market,” he said.“There are 15,000 properties listed for sale on MyHome.ie, an improvement from the beginning of 2022 but below pre-pandemic levels exceeding 20,000.“The average time to sale agreed in Q4 was just 2.7 months, still close to historic lows.”He added that even if mortgage interest rates rise to 4%, debt service ratios are unlikely to become stretched and there will be only a limited headwind to house prices.Mr MacCoille noted that already stretched valuations in Ireland could be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times income.He said this gave an upside risk to the 4% house price inflation prediction for next year.He added that recent months had seen worrying trends in the homebuilding sector, with housing starts slowing, and the construction PMI survey pointing to the flow of new development drying up.“We still expect housing completions will pick up to 28,400 in 2022 and 27,000 in 2023. However, the outlook for 2024 is far more uncertain. The government’s ambitious plans to expedite planning processes are welcome although, as ever, the proof will be in the pudding,” he added.Joanne Geary, managing director of MyHome.ie, said that vendor sentiment had been somewhat affected by rising costs and interest rates.“Over 3% of all properties on MyHome.ie saw asking price reductions in Q4, a low rate but even still the highest figure since Q3 2020,” she said.“However, asking prices tend to fall toward the end of the year, for example, declining by 1.1% on average in the last quarter pre-pandemic. While asking price increases have cooled, the market has still remained remarkably resilient despite the uncertain environment.”She said that stock levels were still a cause for concern.“Stock levels are improving but are still not running at the levels we need to see in order to satisfy demand. As such, we hope to see inflationary pressures ease in the construction sector over the coming months.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'House prices have stretched to almost eight times the average salary, the largest gap for more than a decade. The figures come from the latest MyHome.ie/Davy Q4 Property Price Report, which predicts that residential prices will rise by 4pc this year, down from 6pc last year.It says that prices rose by 3.6pc in Dublin over the last 12 months and by 7.6pc outside the capital. However, all regions experienced price falls in the last quarter of the year, with Dublin falling the most, at 0.8pc.The report comes as property prices in the UK have fallen for four consecutive months, the longest negative run since the height of the previous property boom in 2008.House prices in most major western markets are expected to decline this year, according to a recent Reuters poll, after increases of up to 50pc since the start of the pandemic in 2020.Since 2013, average house prices in Ireland have risen by over 130pc, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). However, the MyHome.ie/Davy report claims that it is still cheaper to own a house than to rent, comparing CSO private rent rises of 11pc last year to average mortgage rates of under 3pc.The report predicts that the final figure for housing completions last year will be 28,400, above the Government’s previously stated target of 24,600. However, it warns that this year will be an “especially uncertain outlook” due to external pressures, despite the “resilience” of the property market last year amid high energy prices, inflation, interest rates and the war on Ukraine.Nationally, the median asking price for a house is €330,000, down 0.4pc for the quarter but up 6pc for the year, according to the report.In Dublin, the median price is €436,000, down 0.8pc for the quarter but up 3.6pc for the year. Outside Dublin, the media price is €283,000, down 0.2pc for the quarter but up 7.6pc for the year.The report says there were 15,000 available properties for sale on MyHome.ie in the fourth quarter, more than the same period a year ago but still below pre-pandemic levels. The average mortgage approval rose to €280,600 in October, up 4.3pc on the previous year, while the average time in reaching a “sale agreed” status in the last quarter was 2.7 months nationwide which the report claims is indicative of “a very tight housing market”.Overall, residential property market transactions will settle at over €21bn for 2022, according to the report, up 7.5pc in volume on 2021.The author of the report, Davy chief economist Conall Mac Coille, warned that buyers were stretched to a degree not seen since 2009.“The average residential transaction in Q3 2022 was €370,000, now 7.7 times the average income of €48,000,” he said. “This is a similar valuation multiple to the UK, where house prices are now falling due to a surge in mortgage rates above 6pc.”He said that “already stretched valuations” in Ireland could be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times’ income. He said this gives an “upside risk” to the 4pc house price inflation prediction for next year.He added that recent months had seen worrying trends in the home-building sector, with housing starts slowing and the construction PMI survey pointing to the flow of new development drying up.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The latest quarterly housing report for MyHome.ie found inflation in asking prices for homes dropped in the last three months of 2022, as is typical for Q4 of a year, but 3% of homes listed for sale actually dropped their price. Over the year, asking prices rose by 6% to a national median of €330,000. In Dublin, median asking prices rose 3.6% to €436,000, while they rose 7.6% outside of Dublin to €283,000. The median asking price in Cork City rose 5.3% in the year to €279,000. A typical two-bed apartment in Cork, meanwhile, rose 5% to €205,000. Davy chief economist Conall MacCoille, who authored the MyHome.ie report, warned the figures show buyers are being stretched to a degree not seen since 2009. “The average residential transaction in Q3 2022 was €370,000, now 7.7x the average income of €48,000,” he said. “This is a similar valuation multiple to the UK, where house prices are now falling due to a surge in mortgage rates above 6%.” Mr MacCoille said already stretched valuations of homes in Ireland could be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times’ income. Describing it both as a “key development” and a “surprise decision”, the economist said the Central Bank estimates it will eventually add 8% to Irish house prices over three years. But he said this 8% could all come in just one year. “It is quite possible that first-time buyers could act more quickly to take on more leverage on their borrowing as they compete for the limited pool of homes listed for sale,” Mr MacCoille said. “This poses an upside risk to our forecast for 4% house price inflation in 2023.” Elsewhere in the latest MyHome.ie report, it says 15,000 properties were available for sale on the platform in Q4, which is still below pre-pandemic levels. The average time to sale agreed in Q4 was 2.7 months, indicative of a “very tight” housing market. The average mortgage approval in October was €280,600, up 4.3% on last year, while the statistics show that, “for those who can get on the ladder, there is an incentive to buy over renting”. Recent trends in the homebuilding sector, however, are described as worrying, with the construction PMI indicator pointing to the flow of new development potentially drying up. Mr MacCoille said the Government’s new First Home scheme “will help overcome viability concerns on housing developments arising from build cost inflation”. But the pick-up in funding costs could well impede apartment development, he added, which has been reliant on institutional investment into the private rental sector. He said it remained the case the market for apartment blocks built for ordinary home buyers just is not there. He said an opinion remains apartments cannot be built and just sold off to ordinary home buyers, as they are expensive to build and difficult to secure finance for. “We still expect housing completions will pick up to 28,400 in 2022 and 27,000 in 2023,” he said. “However, the outlook for 2024 is far more uncertain. The Government’s ambitious plans to expedite planning processes are welcome although, as ever, the proof will be in the pudding.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Teacher shortages: it will get worse before getting better Schools struggled to find substitution cover at primary last year, while at second level qualified teachers in key subjects were in short supply. The issue calmed down in December due, mainly, to the availability of thousands of student teachers. These subs are back in college and the issue will come back into focus once again. Norma Foley has pointed to a host of initiatives aimed at boosting teacher supply such as easing employment restrictions for teachers on career breaks, job shares, etc – but, at its heart, this is an issue tied up with the housing crisis. Many teachers have relocated to cheaper parts of the country or abroad. If meaningful progress is to be made, expect more radical moves such as funding teacher education, more permanent contracts or fast-tracking recognition for teachers abroad. Otherwise, it will rumble on. Leaving Cert reform: battles ahead Most senior cycle reform plans will take years to realise – but the rubber hits the road this year with plans for students entering senior cycle in September 2023 to sit paper one in English and Irish at the end of fifth year. Standing in the way are teachers’ unions. English and Irish teachers’ groups feel especially aggrieved over changes that they say will hurt students. Others see this as a proxy fight over wider plans to introduce teacher-based assessment for up to 40 per cent of marks. Foley insists the changes will ease the burden on students. The future of senior-cycle reform may well hinge on getting this over the line. Free schoolbooks: jostling over costs to parents Funding of almost €50 million was announced in last September’s Budget to provide free schoolbooks and “related classroom resources” to all 540,000 pupils attending primary schools. However, education publishers and independent booksellers believe there are not enough resources to fulfil this pledge and they plan to join forces to highlight these issues in the new year. Some in the sector estimate the allocated funding is in the region of between €80-90 per pupil, yet research by the Irish League of Credit Unions puts the average cost of books at primary level at €110. Expect jostling over whether there is sufficient money to deliver the announcement or whether parents will be expected to fund the difference. Abuse inquiry: ensuring accountability A Government inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse by priests at some of the country’s leading private fee-paying schools looks set to be announced later this month. The calls for an inquiry followed, in particular, recent revelations of historical child sexual abuse in schools run by the Spiritan congregation, particularly at their Willow Park school and Blackrock College in South Dublin. The inquiry will need to be carefully constituted to ensure it enables survivors to have their voices heard and does not impede any Garda investigation. It is a complex task which, based on experience, may take years to complete. Learning loss: the shadow of Covid-19 Incredibly, there is no Department of Education report yet into the extent of any learning loss linked to Covid school closures. Yet, many other jurisdictions have long since quantified the degree to which students have fallen behind. Research from the Netherlands, which had a shorter period of school closures, indicates that primary children performed on average 20 per cent worse on standardised tests and some disadvantaged pupil scored up to 60 per cent worse. Anecdotally, school leaders in Ireland point to a range of deficits – yet, funding has been pulled for Covid catch-up learning programmes. We may see shortly the first indications of any learning gaps in international surveys. The Pirls (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) was conducted in autumn 2021 among student in fifth class. Those results, due soon, will be revealing. School funding: ‘one-off’ measures to continue The Government announced “once-off” funding of €90 million for schools to cope with higher energy bills, equivalent to a 40 per cent increase in school capitation, last October. But few observers expect the cost of energy to dip significantly in 2023. Similar levels of funding, then, are likely to be needed to help school make ends meet later this year. As any politician will tell you, it’s always difficult to end once-off measures which, inevitably, appear as spending cuts. As a result, we may well see a new era of better-resourced schools where fewer are forced to constantly seek parental contributions. Lifelong learning: making college more affordable While we are star pupils across a number of education metrics, we’re nowhere near top of the class when it comes to lifelong learning. Latest Eurostat figures show just under 14 per cent of workers aged 25 to 65 in Ireland participate in upskilling to bolster their professional development, well below participation rates in Sweden (34 per cent) and Finland (30 per cent). The EU’s lifelong learning target is for at least 60 per cent of the adult population to participate in some form of training every year by 2030. So, expect to see moves to make college more affordable and accessible for lifelong learners such as Susi grants for part-time students, greater prior recognition of learning and moves towards more micro-credentials for time-pressed upskillers. Primary curriculum: biggest changes in 20 years A shake-up in how teaching and learning takes place in primary schools – the most dramatic in 20 years – is on the way. A new framework for the primary curriculum, currently under consideration by Norma Foley, could see a reduction in time allocated to religious faith formation and other core subjects. Instead schools would be given much more “flexible time” to decide which areas of learning they want to prioritise. The draft changes could see an increased emphasis on areas such as PE, digital learning and the introduction of foreign languages, education about world religion and ethics, and a broader arts education. Anxious generation: what’s bothering our schoolkids? School principals have expressed concern over rising levels of emotional ill-health, anxiety and mental health problems in schools since the pandemic. Teachers are not experts, psychologists or mental health professionals - yet this is the type of help many pupils need. A new pilot project to provide in-school counselling is due to begin this year. It will be watched closely to see if it can meet children’s needs and become a model for how to better respond to children’s needs. School meals: move to expand scheme A Government programme provides funding towards the provision of free meals to about 1,600 schools benefiting 260,000 children. A report that will shortly be on the desk of Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys – whose department funds the scheme – has a bold recommendation: expand school meals to all primary children by 2030. It sounds fanciful. On closer inspection, it may well be achievable. School meal companies currently provide hot meals to order across many schools that don’t even have canteens at relatively low cost; and under an EU child guarantee, all children in need should have access to a healthy school meal each day. Skills gaps: more apprenticeships Ireland is facing urgent skills gaps across a range of areas such as construction, retrofitting and renewable energy, to name just a few. Increasingly, policymakers see the further education and training sector as key to providing a pipeline of skilled graduates in these areas and others. A key obstacle has been a status problem: many parents and students see it as a “second best” option after college. This year more students will begin to see the smart option of “earn and learn” options which, in many cases, deliver jobs, degrees and decent earnings. School buildings: delays ahead Soaring construction inflation in the latter half of last year ate into the budget for new school buildings. Basic building costs in the education sector, based on tender outcomes, grew by 21 per cent in the first half of last year. There is no sign of these trends abating. With fewer projects taking up more limited resources, it seems inevitable there will be knock-on effects on the delivery of new school buildings and other major projects. Special needs: assessing children’s needs Education authorities were forced to pause the roll-out of controversial school-based education assessments for children with additional needs following concerns among principals, teachers’ unions and campaigners. Campaign groups warned that principals did not have the expertise to identify children’s support needs and warned that the system was potentially unlawful. The health and education system will need to urgently develop a fit-for-purpose model to ensure vulnerable children do not slip through the net. [ Breda O’Brien: School hiring rules need to be reformed to make it easier to find substitute teachers ] 2022: A good year for ... Norma Foley: she secured a record budget, announced free schoolbooks at primary level and an ambitious education reform plan for senior cycle ... now she just has to deliver them. No pressure, then. Technological universities: Following a decade-long campaign, the southeast Technological University was finally established with the merger of WIT and IT Carlow. The new university has a total student population of 18,500 students across four campuses. SNAs: More than 1,300 who completed a UCD training programme were officially recognised as a level-six awardee, the first step towards securing a new entry qualification for classroom professions beyond 3 grade Ds in the Junior Cert. ... and a bad year for: Schools in need of Irish teachers: ... or maths, home economics, woodwork, language teachers, etc Students seeking beds: A combination of late Leaving Cert results, a dire shortage of accommodation and rising rents posed acute problems for many PhD students: Many who earn below the minimum wage are faced with inflation and a cost-of-living crisis. Will a new review improve matters?',\n",

       "  'title': 'Amazing snapshot of life in Ireland in 2022 released by CSO',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Central Statistics Office has released a snapshot into Irish life in 2022. The release is the first part of an overall release of figures and the initial figures concentrate on Society & Environment. Other statistics will be released shortly. Amongst the many details released in the first batch of information includes the most common Irish name for babies, fraud figures and where Ireland’s most energy efficient homes are. The CSO 2022 Highlights section, based on data published by the CSO throughout 2022 up to 12 December 2022, is divided up under the following topics: Our Lives; Our Working Life; Our Society; Our Lives Online; and Our Environment. Population As of Census night on 03 April, the preliminary population count of Ireland in 2022 is 5.1 million – an increase of 7.6% from Census 2016 and the largest population recorded in a Census since 1841. It also showed that all counties experienced a growth in population. Looking at Population and Migration Estimates, there were 768,900 people aged 65 and over living in Ireland as of April 2022, which was an increase of 139,100 people since 2016. The proportion of the population now living in Dublin has also increased to 28.4% of the total in 2022 and now stands at 1,451,000 people. Ukrainian Arrivals As of the week ending 06 November 2022, there were 62,425 people who had arrived from Ukraine to Ireland, of which 34% were aged 19 or younger. Using Census 2016 figures we can see the impact of the war, as at that time there were 4,624 people who were born in Ukraine but were usually resident in Ireland. Names When it comes to naming our children, we picked a wider variety of names for girls in 2021 (4,741 names registered in 2021) than boys (3,863). Fiadh topped the most popular name for girls in 2021 for the first time, ousting the perennially popular Grace, while Jack remained as the most popular name for boys. The number of babies born in 2021 was 58,443, an increase of 2,484 on 2020. The 2021 total is almost 22% lower than 10 years ago when 74,650 births were registered in 2011. The top 10 surnames for babies in 2021 were Murphy, Kelly, Ryan, Walsh, Byrne, O’Brien, O’Connor, O’Sullivan, McCarthy, and Doyle. Weddings Our brides and grooms are getting older as the average age for brides in 2021 was 35.4 years and 37.4 for grooms in opposite-sex marriages. While the most popular form of ceremony for opposite-sex couples was a Catholic ceremony (40%), it was closely followed by civil ceremonies (34%). Deaths Cancer and circulatory disease were the biggest causes of death in Ireland, according to figures published in November 2022, accounting for 5,152 (or 55.2%) of deaths in April, May, and June (Q2) 2022 compared with 3,848 (or 57.4%) in Q2 2021. There were 1,724 deaths due to dementia in Q2 2022, of which, 1,051 (61%) were female and of the 527 deaths due to Alzheimer’s, 355 (67%) were female. COVID-19 Deaths & Vaccinations The number of deaths where COVID-19 was identified as the Underlying Cause of Death (UCOD) in 2021 was 3,011 (or 9.1% of total deaths). Our COVID-19 Vaccination Series in October revealed that just 14% of employees across all sectors were not fully vaccinated and the Accommodation & Food Services sector had the highest percentage of employees who were not fully vaccinated at 23% as of 31 August 2022. Education When it comes to educational attainment, more than half (53%) of 25–64-year-olds in 2022 have a third level education, the highest level in the EU-27. The release published in November also showed that over the last 10 years, there has been an increase in the proportion of those aged 25-64 years old with a third level education, from 40% in 2012 to 53% in 2022. A release in April showed that 80% of 2019 graduates were in substantial employment in the first year after graduation and their median or mid-point earnings was €555 per week. Our Working Life Employment A record rate of employment was recorded in Q2 2022 of 73.5% – the highest rate since the current series began in 1998. The number of people in employment increased by 3.4% to 2,554,300 in the year to Q3, while the estimated total number of hours worked per week in Q3 2022 was 80.3 million hours, up by 3.2 million hours or 4.2% on Q3 2021. The number of people employed rose by more than 650,000 over the 10 years to Q3 2022, and the number of unemployed people fell from just over 350,000 to 120,000 over the same period. Job Satisfaction According to a survey published in April, the majority of employees were satisfied with their job with more than one quarter (25.9%) saying they were very satisfied, while nearly two-thirds (63%) said they were satisfied. However, one in nine employees were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their job. Remote Working We are also changing how we work, as another survey also published in April showed that almost four in ten employees were remote working at some point during 2021, while only one in twelve (8%) workers had availed of some form of remote working pre-COVID-19. Almost three-quarters (74%) of remote workers surveyed said they felt they had more time on their hands while working remotely. Our Society Our social surveys paint a picture of how we live and how we feel. Wealth The Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2020 published in May showed the median net wealth value of Irish households was €193,100. In 2020, 97% of households had some form of savings, (deposit or savings account or positive balance on a current account) with a median value of €8,700. As of Q3 2022, Irish households were saving 19% of their income, down from 20% in Q2 2022. The release published in December noted this was still significantly higher than pre-pandemic savings levels of around 10%. Deprivation However, our most recent Survey in Income and Living Conditions (SILC) release in November painted a different picture as the proportion of people living in enforced deprivation increased from 13.8% in 2021 to 17.1% in 2022. The number of people unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm increased from 3.2% in 2021 to 7.4% in 2022, and households with at least some difficulty in making ends meet increased from 42.0% in 2021 to 49.3% in 2022. Another SILC Survey in May put the at risk of poverty rate at 11.6% in 2021, compared with 13.2% in 2020. Without COVID-19 income supports, the at risk of poverty rate would have been 19.9%. Child Deprivation A number of surveys captured the situation of lone parents, with an online CSO Pulse Survey indicating that 41% of lone parents reporting feeling lonely all or most of the time. Figures published in October 2022 showed that single-parents were more likely (12%) to be unable to afford two pairs of properly fitting shoes for their children when compared with 1% of two-parent households. Trust In June we learned that of respondents to a Pulse Survey who lived alone, 92% said they felt safe and secure in their home, while 83% said they have someone to count on if they had a serious personal problem. A separate Trust Survey published in March found that almost three in four (74%) respondents aged 65 and over were very comfortable with asking a neighbour to keep a set of keys to their home for emergencies. Renters More than three-quarters (76%) of respondents who lived in shared rented accommodation with non-family members said in a Pulse survey they felt like they would never be able to own their own place. Renters also featured in the child deprivation indicators publication, with almost 10% of households that rent unable to afford new clothes for their children, compared with 1% of owner-occupied households. In a separate Pulse Survey, 43% of those renting would consider emigrating to lower their cost of living while 57% of respondents aged 18 to 29 were considering it. Cost of Living Almost every respondent (94%) to a survey conducted in November and published in December said they had made cutbacks, with 62% cutting back on utilities (electricity, heating, etc.), 51% buying less fuel, and 49% not buying as much food. Younger adults were concerned they could not afford to start a family, with nearly three in ten (29%) 18-29 year olds selecting this option on the survey. It also found that men were more likely than women to ask for a pay rise to counteract cost of living increases. Lifestyle A Pulse survey in May showed that more than 40% of respondents aged 18 to 34 took up new outdoor activities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with 13% of those aged 70 and over. Among the activities proposed in the survey, participants were more likely to take up sea swimming in the West (27%) and Border regions (34%), while hill walking was the most popular activity in the Mid-West (33%), and cycling in the Mid-East (27%). Mental Health More than half of the respondents (55%) to a Pulse survey published in May reported spending more time outdoors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and of those, more than 70% realised that being in natural spaces was important to their well-being and 63% spent more time socialising outside. It found that the three main reasons to spend time outdoors in the previous six months for recreational purposes were: For mental health and well-being (76%); For physical health and exercise (75%); and ‘To get fresh air’ (73%). The majority (87%) of those who lived with a pet who responded to a Pulse survey published in June said it has a positive impact on their mental health and well-being. Crime Fraud crime rose by the highest level, up 43% or by 4,877 to 16,202 incidents in the 12 months to June 2022. Theft & Related offences also rose significantly, up 23% or by 10,559 incidents. However, the number of Homicides fell by 38% between Q2 2021 and Q2 2022, falling from 64 such deaths to 40. This was mainly driven by a fall of 17 (-53%) in Dangerous Driving Leading to Death incidents over this period. Crime detection rates were lower for most crime categories in 2021 when compared with 2020, according to figures published in November. Looking at victims of crime and suspected offenders, in 2021 56% of recorded victims of Sexual offences were aged less than 18 years when the offence occurred. For suspected offenders of sexual violence, 98% were male and 18% were aged under 18 years in 2021. Our Lives Online Digital Consumer Behaviour Our Digital Consumer Behaviour 2022 release published in December found that the most popular online purchase was still clothes, shoes, or accessories at 71%, while the numbers of people ordering ready-made food online rose to 58% in 2022, compared with 50% in 2021. Dubliners were most likely to shop online (87%), followed by persons living in the South-East (84%), while internet users living in the Midland region were the least likely (70%). Household Expenditure on Digital Services In July we learned that Irish households spent €49m on social media and dating sites in 2020, while the total household expenditure on digital services in that year was estimated at €896m. Video streaming services at €211m (24%) was the largest category of paid for digital service followed by online gaming at €137m (15%) and online gambling at €130m (15%). The UK provided more digital services to Irish households than any other country at 34% of the total spend, followed by Ireland at 15%, and The Netherlands at 13%. Information Integrity Despite the increased amount of time we spend online, less than four in ten internet users (37%) read privacy policy statements when providing personal information. Digital Transactions in the Irish Economy In November, we learned that 41% of goods and services produced in the economy were ordered or delivered online, or both, to the tune of €154bn. Some 94% of transactions in the Financial Services sector in 2020 were conducted online, and included transactions such as the provision of insurance, pensions, fund management, and online banking. Our Environment Green Energy CSO figures show the continued growth in the number of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles licensed in Ireland. The number of new electric cars licensed has increased by 82% from 8,414 in the first 11 months of 2021 to 15,291 in the same period in 2022. At the same time, the number of new diesel cars has decreased to 26,889 new diesel cars in the first 11 months of 2022 compared with 34,174 in the same period in 2021. By far the most common type of electric vehicle (EV) in 2021 was the conventional hybrid (45%), while one-third of EV owners had a fully electric EV, and more than one in five (22%) had a plug-in hybrid. However, the most common deterrento buying an EV was the purchase price (63%), 29% cited access to public charging infrastructure, while 21% said that no or limited access to home charging was an issue. Separately, in April we learned that in 2020 energy taxes on petrol were 63 cent per litre compared with 51 cent per litre on autodiesel. Energy Use Looking at electricity consumption by data centres, a release published in May showed it had increased by 32% between 2020 and 2021. The increase between January to March 2015 and October to December 2021 was 265%. A separate release in May also found that large energy users accounted for 23% of metered electricity consumption in 2021. Consumption by large energy users increased by 17% between 2020 and 2021 and by 80% between 2015 and 2021. When it comes to our homes, a detached house in 2021 used 8,039 kWh which was 56% more electricity than an apartment (5,160 kWh). Metered Electricity Consumption data showed that Dublin postal districts had the highest proportion of residential consumption in 2021 at 18%, followed by Cork (12%), Dublin county (7%), Galway (6%) and Kildare (5%). Energy Ratings Data published in September showed that A and B rated dwellings consumed more electricity than F and G rated dwellings in 2021. The lowest mean electricity consumption for F and G-rated dwellings in 2021 may indicate that factors other than energy ratings – such as disposable income, whether the house was adequately heated, and use of secondary heating fuels – may have had an impact. In October, a release showed that more than one-third (36%) of non-domestic buildings constructed between 2020 and 2022 received an A rating compared with 21% built between 2015-2019. The most energy efficient building types audited during 2009-2022 were schools and colleges with 37% awarded an A rating. In October, a release found that electricity was the main space heating fuel used in 84% of domestic dwellings where construction was completed between 2020-2022 and with a Building Energy Rating (BER) audit. Dwellings built between 2015-2019 and between 2020-2022 were considerably more energy efficient than those constructed in earlier periods. Kildare (21%), Dublin County (20%), and Meath (20%) had the highest proportion of A ratings while Leitrim had the lowest at 2%. Emissions In October, the CSO noted that greenhouse gas emissions by resident units fell 17% to 63.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on foreign air travel. However, Environmental Indicators 2022 in November found that Ireland had the second highest emissions of greenhouse gases per capita in the EU27 in 2020 at 11.6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Rivers and Land Environmental Indicators 2022 also noted that the proportion of rivers and streams in Ireland with high water quality declined from 27% between 1987-1990 to 17% in 2017-2020. Three counties each had more than 10% of the total length of rivers; Donegal (7,867km), Cork (7,584km), and Mayo (7,464km). Dublin, Longford, and Louth had the shortest total length of rivers, Separately, grasslands accounted for almost 56% of the land cover in Ireland, much higher than the EU average of 10%. Donegal was the county with the lowest coverage of grasslands and croplands, at less than 40%, while Meath and Monaghan had more than 90%. Looking at land protection, herbicides were the main type of plant protection product sold in Ireland in 2020. A release published in July showed that total fertiliser sales increased by 6% in 2021 to 1.7 million tonnes, while sales of lime sales increased by 6% in 2021 to 1.7 million tonnes, while sales of lime sales increased by 50% in 2021 to 1.3 million tonnes.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Varadkar predicts tech sector will continue to grow in medium term',\n",
       "  'text': 'The tech sector will continue to grow in the medium term despite job losses being announced last year, the Taoiseach has predicted. In a briefing for political journalists Leo Varadkar said that a “slightly more positive picture” emerged around the sector in the run-in to Christmas after announcements that Meta, Stripe, Twitter, Intel and others had signalled layoffs or temporary furloughing of workers in the autumn. He said after a difficult autumn period there were no “early warnings at the moment of digital job losses”. “The tech sector is downsizing internationally; we’re not going to be immune from that here,” Mr Varadkar said. “A slightly more positive picture (has emerged) perhaps (in) the last few weeks than would have been the case six or 12 weeks ago,” he said, adding that a lot of tech companies were still recruiting. “It’s a situation that we’ll obviously be keeping under review, I’m certain, though, that in the medium to long term we’re going to see further growth in the tech sector. The future is digital. All of those technologies we’re going to see more of in the future, not less,” he said, arguing that Leaving Cert students and school-leavers should strongly consider science, technology, maths and engineering “because there’s going to be more jobs in those areas, not less”. Last month Mr Varadkar conceded that the housing crisis was a “drag” on inward investment, which is regularly raised with him by executives in multinationals during meetings when discussing potential investments in Ireland. Last week The Irish Times reported that officials in inward investment agency IDA Ireland have expressed anxiety about the impact of the housing crisis on big business, saying the lack of accommodation was “not positive” for Ireland. With building commencements slowing down in 2022 despite increased construction targets for 2023, internal records from the State’s inward investment agency show how companies raising housing issues had described an “unfavourable” situation. IDA Ireland ranks among the most powerful public agencies because of links with 1,700 international companies that employ some 300,000 people, which equates to almost 12 per cent of the State’s 2.55 million workforce. “As you can guess IDA’s clients are worried about the housing and in particular the rental situation across the country, and I [would] just like to get an update from you on where you feel our rental policy is at and any new developments,” said one email to the Department of Housing from Tommy Fanning, IDA head of strategic policy.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Many tenants overholding on properties as they can find nowhere else to go',\n",
       "  'text': 'A tenant who had been served an eviction notice for the Co Clare property in which he lived with his family said he had no place to go. Appearing before a tenancy tribunal via Microsoft Teams, the man, who had been accused of overholding by the landlord, said there were “many things wrong” with the house, such as the heating system. The family did not like the dwelling, he said, adding they were not going to stay but “cannot find anywhere” else to live. The tenant was facing a tribunal of three decision-makers in one of the final steps in the dispute-resolution process between landlords and tenants, held by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). The determination of the tribunal is binding, and can be appealed only on a point of law via the High Court. When a determination order is issued by the tribunal, it can be enforced if a party involved in the case makes an application to the District Court to make the RTB decision a court order. This, barristers working in the sector have said, is not unusual and does happen, though is not required in the majority of cases as most people comply. In the Co Clare case, heard in March 2022, the tribunal determined that the tenant and his family must vacate the dwelling within 28 days of the date of issue of the determination order. There is desperation in many of the cases heard by the tribunals, with the disputes often laying bare the extent of the housing and homelessness crisis. In May 2022, one appellant in Dublin had his appeal heard by a tribunal after he was served an eviction notice. Despite viewing 10 properties, he said he could not find alternative accommodation. The tenant, who was accused of overholding, said he believed he was competing with about 800 other people for each property he attempted to rent. He had two young children who were attending a school near the dwelling, he said, adding that a move to alternative accommodation would involve a change of school which would cause upset to his children. The tribunal determined that the tenant must vacate and give up possession of the dwelling within a 42 days of the date of issue of the determination order. The Irish Times analysed the almost 400 RTB tribunal reports and determination orders that were published in 2022. The reports detailed the disputes arising between tenants and landlords, or, in some cases, third parties who claimed to be affected by a tenancy. According to the RTB’s data, rent arrears and overholding were the most frequent dispute types reported in 2021, accounting for 31 per cent of all complaints made that year. The second most common reason reported was deposit retention (19 per cent of cases), followed by validity of notice of termination (17 per cent of cases) and a breach of landlord obligations (17 per cent of cases). A breakdown of figures for 2022 is awaited. Overholding The issue of overholding frequently results from a fear of becoming homeless, according to the evidence provided by tenants during the tribunals. In another case, heard by the tribunal in March, the tenant’s representative said they were making “every effort to find new accommodation and getting in contact with the correct people but that it had not yet succeeded”. The landlord in the same case said he required the dwelling for his own needs. His children shared a bedroom with him following the breakdown of his marriage, he said, and he had difficulties in terms of mortgage arrears. In Mayo, a tenant who lived in a rented home with her three children said if she was evicted she and her family would be homeless. She told the tribunal in February that she was doing her best and was not overholding deliberately. In April 2022, a couple renting a Dublin home, who had been served a notice of termination, told the tribunal they were in the process of purchasing their own house. They had paid a deposit for the property in February 2021, but “due to the imposition of Covid restrictions, labour shortages and supply issues the construction of the house was delayed” but would be completed in about three months. The tenant said “due to the current housing crisis, when they received the notice of termination, their options were limited and they had to choose between being homeless or overholding”. The couple wanted to move out, he said, but “they were in an impossible situation, and it was difficult to find a short-term solution to their problem”. Sources working in the sector said while overholding is a common dispute type brought to the RTB, it can sometimes be agreed between parties that it is beneficial to take this course of action. In some cases, landlords bring the case to the RTB “out of kindness” as tenants require a determination order to get on various housing support lists, such as social housing or homeless lists, legal sources said. Meanwhile, other tenants stated they accepted and moved into dwellings with insufficient heating, mould or damp, as they had been homeless and just wanted a roof over their heads. sources working in the sector said. Later, these issues became bigger, resulting in some of them having to take a case to the RTB, complaining that their landlords had breached their obligations. Mould and damp were common issues raised by tenants to the tribunal, with at least 17 and nine complaints respectively relating to these concerns. Heating problems also featured regularly, as did broken or damaged furniture or appliances. Ann-Marie O’Reilly, national advocacy manager at Threshold, a charity advocating for rental rights, said it can be quite difficult for a renter to go to a landlord asking for repairs. Heating and boiler repairs are common issues that arise, she added. “There’s a bit of a sense among people who just want to keep their head down. What happens is people don’t say anything and they put up with things that are not okay,” she said, attributing this to the shortage of alternative accommodation options. However, these problems can then worsen as they’ve been left untreated, resulting in a bigger dispute between the two parties. Mary Conway, chairwoman of the Irish Property Owners’ Association, said the current legislation and tax on rental income are the reasons behind landlords leaving the sector Many tenants taking appeals were immigrants, the analysis of the tribunal filings show. Ms O’Reilly said there is potential for migrants to be more vulnerable in this regard, as they may not understand their rights under tenancy laws. “Maybe they’re more likely to challenge things or they don’t have a choice. While it is very difficult to find alternative accommodation for everyone, if you’re not from here and maybe don’t have family or friends with their ear to the ground, maybe you’re left with no choice but to challenge things and hold on to what you have,” she added. One significant change in recent years, Ms O’Reilly said, is the number of cases in which a notice of termination is served because of a landlord’s intention to sell the property. Previously, she said, a lot of these notices would have been deemed invalid. Now, however, the majority of landlords who issue a notice for this reason are found to have a genuine intention to sell. This is reflected in RTB figures, which show 43,000 landlords left the private rental market over the past five years. Adding to this, a quarter of small landlords are likely or very likely to sell their rental properties in the next five years, according to research done by the board. Tom Dunne, chairman of the RTB, recently told a meeting of the Oireachtas housing committee that this shift could be attributed to people who bought properties during the Celtic Tiger, rented them out when they upsized, but have now sold them on as they are no longer in negative equity. However, Mary Conway, chairwoman of the Irish Property Owners’ Association, said the current legislation and tax on rental income are the reasons behind landlords leaving the sector. “For the most part, tenants are absolutely fine. Generally, the reason is the legislation, the RTB and the tax and how long it takes to get in and get things sorted out with regards to overholding,” she said. “Before you actually get to the RTB at all, it could be six months. So you’re already down six months [rent payments] at that stage. I don’t think tenants want to default on their rent. People can fall on hardship.” Under law, if rent arrears arise, a landlord must present the tenant with a written arrears warning notice of a minimum of 28 days. If the arrears are not being paid off during that time, a notice of termination can then be issued, equalling an additional 28 days. If one of the parties decides to then take a case to the RTB, that results in things being delayed further. The average processing time for an initial hearing of a complaint was 19.5 weeks in 2021, while the processing time for tribunals, the next step if the case is appealed, was 33.4 weeks. A spokesman for the RTB said while the body “adapted speedily and implemented changes to processes to maintain services during the pandemic, the impact of Covid-19 inevitably created a backlog of cases”. In 2022, the body has also seen an increase in the volume of applications for dispute resolution, the spokesman said, which will also have an impact on processing times. Most small landlords, 94 per cent, are part-time and do not manage properties as their primary occupation, a 2022 survey by the RTB found. According to Ms Conway, this means margins are small, with many renting out the property only to cover their mortgage. This creates difficult financial situations when tenants stop paying, she said, adding that mortgage arrears become a real concern. Many tenants who fell into rent arrears and who appeared before a tenancy tribunal spoke about falling into financial hardship, with a significant proportion attributing this hardship to job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic. The extent of arrears varied significantly, according to the tribunal reports. Some landlords were owed one month’s rent, while others had accumulated arrears in excess of €25,000. The highest level of arrears recorded in the reports was €60,000. Ms Conway said 99.9 per cent of the time when a tribunal determines that a landlord is due the rent arrears, they do not receive it. She said: “If they didn’t have the money to pay initially, where are they going to get it to backpay? Landlords tend to just accept the losses. How can they pay for it, if they don’t have it?”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Cost of building hundreds of schools soars amid construction inflation',\n",
       "  'text': 'Soaring inflation in the construction sector is making it difficult for contractors to stand over tendered costs for delivering hundreds of school-building projects. Department of Education records show there are more than 300 school building-projects under construction, along with a continuous stream of other projects at or near tendering stage. Internal records released under the Freedom of Information Act flag concerns over project delays and construction inflation linked to the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and “challenging market conditions”. During the first half of last year the Department of Education was forced to increase its basic building costs by 21 per cent based on reviews of actual tender outcomes. This forced the department to seek an additional capital allocation of €300 million during 2022 to meet “significant budgetary pressures” linked to the rising cost of construction, as well as the need to accelerate school accommodation for children with special needs and young people from Ukraine. Of the hundreds of school-construction projects under way they include in excess of 50 new or replacement school buildings and 300 extensions to existing schools, the majority of which are due to be completed by the end of 2023. When asked if projects will be delayed due to rising construction costs and other factors, a spokesman for the department said a €860 million capital allocation in 2023 provided a platform for “strong roll-out” of school-building projects. He said this investment would also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050. “The Department of Education has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school-building programme. There are currently in excess of 300 school-building projects at construction, with other projects in design and at or near the tendering stage.” The spokesman said inflation has created challenges in the construction sector, and the schools sector was no different. “There are central arrangements in place for dealing with inflation which are reflected in the co-operation framework for inflation which was announced by Government earlier this year. This framework provides clarity for contractors when tendering for public works contracts.” He added that the status of all projects were listed on a county by county basis at www.gov.ie. and was updated on a regular basis to reflect their progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction. Special education, meanwhile, was a driver of increased school-construction costs last year. Moves to ensure 900 children with special education needs had access to an appropriate school place required additional investment of €100 million. This was achieved through 83 projects involving mainly modular accommodation. There are also big pressures on the special education front at post-primary level and in large urban centres at primary level, with assessments of needs backlogs and increased evidence of autism. While most Ukrainian pupils are being accommodated within existing schools, the greatest pressure on capacity is at post-primary level where student numbers are rising and there remain significant special needs capacity deficits. A total of €55 million was required for 45 projects at second level to cater to these additional Ukrainian enrolments.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Nearly 700 forestry road licences issued in Ireland',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) has issued an estimated 695 forestry road licences to date, latest figures indicate. Construction of forest roads is exempt from the planning system unless it connects to a public road. According to DAFM, all forest road construction “must be built in a manner that protects water quality and in accordance with the National Council for Forest Research and Development (COFORD) Forest Road Manual (2006) “. This outlines that roadside drainage “must not be allowed to discharge directly into natural watercourses and should be allowed to run out through buffer strips”. All forest road construction projects must secure a licence and the written consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. These regulations apply to the entire forest road project and also govern access to and from public roads. The government is currently in the process of “considering and integrating feedback from stakeholders and the public” following the public consultation on the proposed new €1.3 billion Forestry Programme for 2023-2027. The new programme intends to increase premiums for planting trees by between 46% and 66% and to extend the premium period from 15 to 20 years for farmers. DAFM has outlined that the programme “will cover all costs to establish a forest”, and depending on the type of forest, could pay landowners more than €1,100/ha for up to 20 years. The programme will be 100% exchequer funded but is subject to state-aid approval by the European Commission. According to DAFM, the programme “will come into force in early 2023” once approval is secured from the commission. State aid guidelines in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas expired on December 31, 2022 and are scheduled to be replaced with a revised version this month. The Irish government cannot submit a formal application for state aid in relation to the new forestry programme until the revised guidelines are in place. Interim forestry scheme Agriculture minister, Charlie McConalogue has confirmed that his department is “engaged” with the commission wich has “facilitated the submission of a pre-notification for this state aid in November ahead of the formal submission for January 2023”. The minister said that DAFM continues to engage bilaterally with the relevant directorate generals in the commission “in order to advance the state aid approval”. In the meantime Minister McConalogue has approved an interim afforestation scheme and an interim forest road scheme based on the De Minimis rule which effectively makes them exempt from state aid rules. In a letter to all registered foresters and other stakeholders, DAFM said that these schemes are being offered to applicants who held “a valid technical approval for afforestation or roads” on December, 31 2022 – but had not commenced work on planting or road construction in 2022, and did not wish to wait until the launch of the Forestry Programme 2023–2027. However the department has stressed that if anyone opts to take part in the interim schemes they will not be permitted to “revert” to the new forestry programme once it is in place. For landowners who may already have a valid technical approval in place for afforestation or a road scheme but who had not commenced work in 2022, they now, according to DAFM, have the option of: Postponing planting or road construction until the launch of the new Forestry Programme 2023-2027 and opting into the new programme;Opting into the interim afforestation/forest road schemes (on the De Minimis basis) with the grants and premiums payable for these schemes outlined in the proposed grants and premiums detailed in the Forestry Programme 2023–2027. However, if someone with a valid approval wants to wait until the launch of new forestry programme, then the department has said they do not have to take any further action at this time.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Construction and Farming sectors account for almost three quarters of all work-related fatalities Provisional data from the Health & Safety Authority (HAS) shows that 26 people lost their lives in work-related incidents in 2022 compared to 38 in 2021, representing the lowest figure recorded since the Authority was established over thirty years ago. Summary of statistics reported by HSA are as follows: Fatal incidents happened to victims from all age groups, the highest number involved people between 55-64 years with 10 fatalities The age groups 55-64 and 65 years and over represents 69% of all fatalities in 2022, with these age groups representing 19% of employees in Ireland (CSO figures up to end of Q3 2022) Falling from height (9 fatalities) and loss of control of a vehicle or its attachments (7 fatalities) were the leading causes of work-related fatalities in 2022 Farming saw 12 fatalities recorded in 2022 compared to 10 in 2021, with it remaining the sector with the highest number of fatalities Dublin, Galway and Wexford recorded the highest level of fatalities with three in each county No fatalities were recorded in 2022 in counties Carlow, Clare, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Sligo and Wicklow Of the 26 fatalities in 2022, 10 were employees, 13 were self-employed and 3 were non-workers Of the 26 fatalities in 2022, 25 were Male and 1 was Female The transport and storage sector recorded a decline of 83% with one fatality in 2022, compared to six in 2021 Manufacturing recorded no fatalities in 2022, compared to five in 2021 Releasing provisional annual statistics for 2022, the Health and Safety Authority welcomed a decline of over 30% to 26 work-related fatalities in 2022 from 38 in 2021, the lowest figure recorded since the Authority was established. This decline comes against a 3.4% increase in employment figures (Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021). While the confirmed number of work-related fatalities this year is the lowest recorded, it is important to point out that there are ongoing investigations that may see the reported/recorded number of fatalities increase. Commenting on the HSA’s provisional data on fatalities in Irish workplaces, Mark Cullen, Interim Chief Executive at the Health and Safety Authority said, “It is positive to see such a substantial decline in work-related fatalities in 2022. However, our view is that every work-related death is preventable and vigilance around health and safety in Irish workplaces is still imperative. Christmas this year for the families and friends of all those killed in workplace incidents will have been a difficult one and our thoughts are with them”. The HSA reports show that falling from height (9 fatalities) and loss of control of a vehicle or its attachments (7 fatalities) were the leading causes of work-related fatalities in 2022. Mark added: “We see a large number of fatalities relating to working at height and vehicle handling. We also know from the data that the age groups 55 and over represents 69% of all fatalities in 2022, with these age groups representing 19% of employees in Ireland. As Ireland’s labour force is aging, we must all look to our work place practices, and ensure that health and safety is being prioritised across all workforce age groups.” Farming continues to be one of the most dangerous sectors in which to work, and sees an increase with 12 fatalities recorded in 2022 compared to 10 in 2021. “We are urging employers and their workers to think about the task you’re asking others to carry out, or that you are about to undertake. Complete a risk assessment and make sure the right precautions are in place and nobody is putting themselves or others in danger. As evident in our records for 2022, if working with heavy machinery or at a height, be particularly vigilant and take the appropriate care”. In relation to the construction sector which saw a decline in fatalities in 2022, Mark said, “The construction sector saw a decline of 30% with 7 fatalities in 2022 compared to ten in 2021. We welcome this lower number, but are all too aware of this industry being one of the most dangerous. We would ask that smaller sites and contractors in particular continue to ensure that their own and their workers’ safety is a priority every day.” The Health and Safety Authority has guidance and supports available across industry sectors in Ireland and the www.BeSMART.ie tool is freely available to employers and employees.

       "  'title': 'Homelessness record broken again as 11,542 people in emergency accommodation in November',\n",
       "  'text': 'THE NUMBER OF people experiencing homelessness in Ireland has once again hit a record high with latest government figures showing that 11,542 people were living in emergency accommodation in November. It is the fifth consecutive month that the record number has been broken. A total of 5,423 single adults, 1,371 young people and 3,494 children were living in emergency accommodation between 21 and 27 November. It means that 145 more people were living in emergency accommodation in November of last year than the previous month. The figures also represent a 26.85% increase in homelessness compared to the same time period last year. There was also a record high number of young people, aged 18-24, in emergency accommodation in November. Simon Communities of Ireland Executive Director Wayne Stanley said that the government’s decision to introduce a moratorium on evictions over winter was an “important step”, but that unless more secure accommodation can be provided throughout 2023, Ireland may face ongoing extensions and renewals of the eviction ban. Stanley warned that this would not be a “long-term solution”, and added that Ireland needs to see “innovation” in housing provision this year, including driving forward with the focus on rapid build homes. “It is timely to reflect that 11,542 people living in emergency accommodation only a year ago seemed unthinkable,” he said. “2023 needs to be a year of delivery for those at the sharpest end of the ongoing housing crisis or we will see the unthinkable surpassed and redefined each month.” He also called on the government to insert a right to housing into the Irish constitution. ‘Tragedy’ In Dublin, 1,134 families were in emergency accommodation in November, including 2,549 children. The CEO of Dublin Simon Community Catherine Kenny said that they are “dismayed” to see that, for a seventh month in a row, “we have broken the record for the highest number of people ever recorded in homelessness in the capital”. “These spiralling figures convey nothing short of a tragedy,” she added. Kenny further noted that these figures do not include those sleeping rough, staying in domestic violence refuges or the hidden homeless population. She said that it is especially concerning to see an older cohort of people presenting to emergency accommodation services in Dublin. “In the last 12 months, the number of people aged 65 and older entering into emergency accommodation has grown by\\u202f36%. Over the same period, the number of people aged between 45 and 64 entering into emergency accommodation has grown by\\u202f25%. “Their fear is palpable as they try to cope with the stark reality of becoming homeless in older age, and are faced with navigating a very complex system. As we enter into a new year, many will worry what will become of them,” she said. Kenny called on the government to take radical action to tackle the homelessness crisis, adding that it is “simply unacceptable in a first world country with a successful economy”. Focus Ireland CEO Pat Dennigan said that while the charity welcomed commitments to address the homelessness crisis, “we need to see those words turned into urgent action”. “2,706 new build social homes were delivered between January and September 2022, and while final figures for 2022 will not be released until March, Minister O’Brien has said that most newly built social homes were completed towards the end of 2023. “The minister has indicated that last year more social homes were built than for very many years, which would mean that local authorities could be allocating upwards of 3,000 new social homes over the next few months,” he said. Dennigan said that the onus is on the Government to ensure that these homes are allocated in a way that creates a fair balance between the families who have spent years on the waiting list living in unsuitable conditions, and those who are trapped in homelessness, but have not been registered for so long. ‘We can no longer rely on the private sector’ Analysis by Focus Ireland suggests that the current winter eviction ban will have a much more limited impact on homelessness than the Covid-19 eviction ban, which saw figures drop almost 20%. Dennigan explained that this is because during the Covid-19 eviction ban, as well as fewer families becoming homeless, there was an increase in families moving out of homelessness as private rental properties became available on the market. Focus Ireland does not expect that to see an increase in families moving out of homelessness during the winter eviction ban as “we can no longer rely on private sector to provide a route out of homelessness”. Dennigan stressed the importance that this places on new social housing units over the next few months. He also said that it is highly concerning that a large number of families and single families have now been in emergency accommodation for over two years. “This is unacceptable. It’s important to remember that when we discuss these figures we are talking about human beings struggling every day and the trauma of long-term homelessness can leave a lasting trauma long after they finally find a home,” he said. Dennigan said that if the eviction ban is lifted in April, we will face a wave of Spring evictions, “with no emergency accommodation available” for the people affected. He said that the Housing Minister needs to take measures to encourage landlords not to sell up, and that constructive engagement is needed with the over 1,000 landlords who have already issued notice of terminations, and are currently waiting for the eviction ban to lift before they sell up.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Citigroup signs deal for new European HQ in Dublin docklands',\n",
       "  'text': 'Citigroup has signed for a new headquarters in Dublin, in a timely boost for the office market in the capital. The US lender has agreed a €300 million deal for a new office campus in the city’s north docklands. The deal with Johnny Ronan’s RGRE for the delivery of 300,000sq ft (27,870sq m) of office space at the developer’s Waterfront South Central site was concluded in the week leading up to Christmas. Citi is understood to be paying about €100 million to acquire the site with a further €200 million being set aside for the construction of its new base. Due for completion in 2026, the bank’s proposed footprint will equate to roughly 70 per cent of the 430,000sq ft of office accommodation RGRE intends to develop as part of the wider north docklands scheme. News of the agreement should provide something of a fillip for the capital’s commercial property sector coming as it does at a turbulent time for the global tech companies whose requirements have driven much of the demand for office space in the Dublin market over recent years. Facebook’s decision not to occupy the four blocks developed for it by RGRE at its new Ballsbridge campus has, for instance, brought 34,838sq m (375,000sq ft) of office space back to the letting market while LinkedIn’s decision last October to seek an alternative occupier for two blocks under development at its new European headquarters in Wilton Park have added a further 265,000sq ft to the city’s available office stock. Firms took up about 206,000sq m of office space in Dublin during 2022, CBRE said in a statement on Friday. That was an increase of about 35 per cent year on year. Still, it is about two-thirds the amount of space taken up in 2019 before the pandemic struck. It remains to be seen meanwhile, what impact, if any, Salesforce’s announcement earlier this week to cut its global workforce by 10 per cent will have on its office accommodation requirements in Dublin. The company is due to move into its newly developed European headquarters at Spencer Place in the city’s north docklands in March. Developed by RGRE, the campus extends to 40,041sq m (431,000sq ft) and comprises three office buildings along with a 204-bedroom hotel let to Ireland’s largest hotel operator, Dalata Hotel Group. While Salesforce signalled its intention this week to reduce its office footprint globally by setting aside $450 million-$650 million for what it describes as “exit charges associated with office space reductions”, in the case of Dublin, much of the heavy lifting may already have been done. As reported by The Irish Times in December, SMBC Aviation Capital has agreed a deal for all 135,617sq ft of space at Fitzwilliam 28, the newly developed office block which Slack Technologies had signed for in early 2020. That plan was abandoned when Slack was acquired subsequently for €27.7 billion by Salesforce. Slack’s entire operations will now be located at Salesforce’s new European headquarters at Spencer Place.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Glenveagh setback this week may open up opportunity for rival Cairn',\n",
       "  'text': 'Glenveagh Properties, one of the worst performing stocks on the Iseq 20 last year as it lost close to a third of its value, had a stab at a rally in the first days of trading in 2023. It didn’t last long. A trading statement from the home builder on Thursday sent the stock tumbling as much as 10 per cent on the day, as it downgraded its forecast for suburban house completions this year by 20 per cent to about 1,350 units – citing “near-term gridlock” in the planning system at a time when supply is continuing to fall well short of demand in the State and the housing crisis is supposed to be a top Government priority. Back in September, Glenveagh said it had planning in place for 80 per cent of the 1,700 homes it then aimed to complete this year, and that it expected to receive the go-ahead from An Bord Pleanála (ABP) on the remaining 20 per cent during the fourth quarter. None of the anticipated approvals came through. Just days before Christmas, ABP issued an apology for ongoing delays in issuing planning decisions, admitting it was not meeting “statutory objective time frames for decisions for a large number” of cases. The embattled planning body also highlighted that its board, which takes decisions on appeals or applications, was operating with half of its standard complement of 10 members. Glenveagh, led by chief executive Stephen Garvey, used the trading statement to urge planning system reform be “expedited to solve the longer term structural supply issues the sector faces”. The outline of draft legislation published last month has the object of, among other things, recasting ABP under a new name and decision-making structure, and tightening the time frames for judicial reviews of planning decisions, in an effort to avoid projects being bogged down in legal proceedings. The Government aims to enact the planned laws “in early 2023”. But it is no quick fix. While the Government has a target for an average of 33,000 homes to be built every year until 2030, Davy analyst Conall Mac Coille estimates house completions will actually fall this year to 27,000 from 28,400 in 2022. Glenveagh has long set its sights on becoming the biggest housebuilder in the State, and to be churning out 3,000 homes by 2024. Peer Cairn’s aim is to deliver 5,000-5,500 homes in the three years to 2024, which, when factoring in the 1,500 units factored in for last year, points to a more manageable average of 1,750-2,000 for this year and next. Some 2,000 of Glenveagh’s 2024 target is forecast to come from building houses, mainly in the Dublin commuter belt, with the rest coming from building urban apartments for investment firms involved in the private rental sector (PRS) and a new line of business developing social and affordable units in partnership with local authorities and State agencies. Glenveagh has enough to be getting on with, for now, on the urban front – having agreed forward funding deals last year to develop projects in the Citywest, Castleknock, Blackrock and north docklands areas of Dublin, totalling more than €310 million. However, this line of business has become increasingly challenged over the past six months, as overseas money that flooded into the sector in recent years – including German and Dutch pension funds – has all but dried up since the European Central Bank (ECB) started to jack up interest rates. “There is a real viability issue in PRS at the moment,” said Colin Sheridan, an analyst with Davy. “Buyers that were in the market in recent years were buying at rental yields of as low as 3.6 per cent in prime areas... Even if PRS investors come back to the market, they’ll be demanding higher yields than they previously had accepted.” Jonathan Coubrough, an analyst with London brokerage Numis, noted to clients that Glenveagh was struggling to scale up its business as quickly as it would have liked. “We see further timing risk here,” he said, reiterating his reduce recommendation – the equivalent of a sell – on the stock. Barclays analyst Celine Soo-Huynh was more upbeat, saying “fundamentals are expected to remain resilient” this year, with house price inflation expected to amount to 6 per cent, while construction cost inflation, which had hit the construction sector hard last year, should also ease. Irish lenders have largely lagged behind European peers in passing on ECB rate hikes. “The 30 per cent presale on the units completing in 2023 is lower than the year prior, but management expects the recent announcements by the [Central] Bank of Ireland on less restrictive mortgage requirements, as well as a supportive Irish housing policy, to still fuel demand for new homes,” she said. This time last year, Glenveagh had already signed up buyers for almost 45 per cent of the owner occupier homes it ended up completing last year. Some believe that Cairn – which had a head start on accumulating its land bank following the crash and floating on the stock market – should break away from its arch-rival in the eyes of investors. Shares in Cairn, trading at 91 cent in Dublin on Friday afternoon, and Glenveagh, changing hands at under 87c, are well below their respective €1 initial public offering prices. Could a scheduled trading statement from Cairn on Monday morning be a catalyst? “Cairn is in a more advantageous position from a planning perspective – with 90 per cent of its guided unit volumes to 2024 having full planning permission,” said Shane Carberry, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers. The overriding ambition of both housebuilders is to deliver profit returns by 2024 that are the equivalent of 15 per cent of shareholders’ equity. Glenveagh has more work to do, with its estimated return on equity last year of 7 per cent below Cairn’s 11 per cent target. Glenveagh has been relying more heavily on share buy-backs and to get there, having repurchased and cancelled close to €254 million of its stock over the past years (helped by money received from the forward sale of apartment schemes). It announced on Thursday that it planned to repurchase a further 10 per cent of its stock – which equates to €55 million based on its current share price. More buy-backs may be in store if it fails to deliver on hitting ambitious building targets.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Immunologist says stronger advice on mask-wearing needed amid surge in respiratory viruses',\n",
       "  'text': 'AN IMMUNOLOGIST HAS said that the Government “missed a trick” by not strongly advising the public of the importance of wearing masks before the current winter surge that is seeing record hospital overcrowding due to a rise in respiratory illnesses. Professor Christine Loscher told The Journal that while the current public health advice doesn’t need to be changed, there needs to be more communication on the effectiveness of mask-wearing in preventing the spread of Covid-19 and influenza. The health service is coming under an increasing amount of pressure at the moment due to the number of patients presenting with respiratory viruses. While Covid and RSV are significant factors, officials have singled out influenza as being of particular concern, with cases increasing rapidly and no clear indication of when they might peak. On Tuesday, a record 931 patients were without beds in Irish hospitals, the highest figure ever recorded by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO). While that figure has reduced in recent days, the interim CEO of the HSE, Stephen Mulvany, has said that despite this week being the worst on record for hospital overcrowding, he cannot say for certain that “it won’t get worse before it gets better”. Mask wearing Speaking to The Journal, Dr Christine Loscher said: “I think that we missed a trick in that we should have been getting the public on board with the fact that when things surge, we could do something to help the situation, and that this is what we should have been doing all along.” “Now we’re not just dealing with Covid, but we’re dealing with RSV and the flu,” she said, adding that she doesn’t know whether the public “are as on board as we need them to be” with the public health advice because of a lack of messaging and not being used to following the advice since restrictions were lifted. “We have evidence from the last couple of winters that when we do behave differently, we also impact on those viruses. There needs to be very strong advice that we should wear masks on public transport and in crowded indoor, poorly ventilated spaces at the moment, in order to reduce everyone’s risk.” Currently, the public health advice on mask-wearing is that while they are no longer mandatory, masks are still advised on public transport and in healthcare settings such as hospitals and GP surgeries. Call for mask mandate But last week, the INMO called on the Government to “make difficult decisions including the return of mandated mask-wearing in congregated settings” in an effort to reduce the spread of respiratory infections. “We know that one of the main pressure points in our health service is the rise of respiratory infections. Asking people to return to mask-wearing in busy congregated settings is a simple measure,” Phil Ní Sheaghdha, general secretary of the INMO, said. However, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has said that the official advice to Government is that mask mandates are not required. “I don’t anticipate any change coming in terms of the public health advice from the Chief Medical Officer,” Donnelly said. “However, I want to fully acknowledge the INMO’s concerns, I think they are playing a very constructive role. I got a letter in from them today, we had a good chat earlier on today. They’re looking for solutions,” Donnelly said. “The public health advice to Government, to me at the moment, it is not a move to mask mandates, but obviously we will keep the situation under review on a daily and on a weekly basis.” Loscher is not in favour of introducing a mask mandate, and believes that issuing stronger advice is the way to go. “We’ve missed the boat on forming that habit, now we’re in dire straits and we need people to respond. I can totally understand the INMO calling for a mandate because they’re the frontline dealing with the desperate situation that everyone’s in at the moment,” she said. “Mandates come with controversy; it ends up being huge discussions, whereas I think that it needs to be, again, reiterating the benefits to people of infection control using masks, hand washing and sanitising.” At a briefing on Tuesday, the Government said flu cases are much higher than in previous years, with the number of people being hospitalised more than doubled compared to pre-Covid. Flu vaccines Compared to 2019, there were 2,331 lab confirmed cases of flu identified up to Christmas week. This is in contrast to 1,000 cases in 2019. Of the 2,331 cases, a total of 637 people hospitalised which compared to 350 people on past figures. Loscher said the current flu season still hasn’t peaked and that there’s “still an awful lot of people out there who will get the flu”. There is no doubt that when we were wearing masks in the context of Covid, that it did have a huge impact in terms of the incidence of things like flu and other respiratory viruses. She previously told The Journal that she would have liked to have seen flu vaccines free for everyone the way they were in the last few years. The vaccine is currently free for people aged 65 and over, children aged 2-17, healthcare workers and people with long-term health conditions. She said that by making the flu vaccine free for all age cohorts, it is likely to improve the uptake of the vaccine and reduce the spread of the virus. “If you want people to behave a certain way, you’ve got to make it easy for them. When you put barriers in the way like increased costs, I think it really impacts on people engaging with them anymore,” she said. Attitude towards masks While more people have been visibly wearing face masks on public transport and in crowded settings in recent weeks, the vast majority of people are not wearing one. Pete Lunn, the head of behavioural research at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), told The Journal that it is unlikely that there will be a significant increase in mask-wearing under the current guidance. “When the mandate was lifted for masks on public transport and in some other public settings, there was a very rapid fall-off in people wearing them. There is a very big difference between having a rule and something being guidance, however strong that guidance is,” Lunn said. “Part of the reason for this is that because mask-wearing is very much a collective activity, people tend to do it much more when they see that other people are doing it too. The existence of a rule really, really drives up the proportion of people who are wearing masks. And when you take the rule away, even if it remains guidance, as soon as people see that some other people aren’t doing it, the numbers doing it drop. From a behavioural science point of view, essentially you move from an equilibrium where people are cooperating with each other because they can see other people are doing it – to a situation where because a lot of people aren’t doing it, the people who would cooperate don’t, because they can’t see why they should bother if other people aren’t bothering. “You end up with a minority doing it, who are the ones who are perhaps most at risk or ones that believe in it most, or whatever it happens to be, but you get a really big change. “If I’m honest, I think it would be very difficult to get mask-wearing back up to a high level again purely through voluntary guidance. Ultimately, it’s going to take a decision to say: ‘Look, there is a mandate in these circumstances, this is what everyone has to do.’” Lunn said that were a mask mandate to be introduced, it is difficult to know what the public response would be. “In the past, whenever we’ve introduced genuine rules about this, the very large majority of people stuck to it,” he said. “I think it’s pretty clear to everyone at this stage that we have a problem. Given what they’re seeing on the news and given the way people have responded in the past to pressure on the hospitals and rises in case numbers, I would anticipate that if we strengthen the rules surrounding wearing masks, that more people will wear them and we’ll get pretty high compliance, but I can’t be sure about that.” Loscher said that while it is possible that people may not resume wearing masks at the level previously seen, a strong message from Government could still see an increase in the number of people following the public health advice. “One way of changing behaviour is to make it mandatory. We all know that when people have to comply, they will. I think the reason that maybe the uptake on mask wearing won’t be as much as it could have been, is because this is what we should have been doing over the last few cycles of Covid so that people are used to: ‘This is what we do when we get a surge and the healthcare sector is impacted’,” she said. “I do think there’s lots of very small things that we can do, and that will help, but I think it’s about the Government and the HSE coming out and asking people to help support the healthcare sector and the healthcare workers at the moment by doing that range of things where they can. That message is very strong, and I think that’s a message that people respond to very well.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Increase in online shopping prompts spike in demand for warehouse space in Limerick',\n",
       "  'text': 'AN INCREASE in online shopping has resulted in a spike in demand for warehousing space in Limerick. That\\'s according to two leading city auctioneers, who have expressed positivity in the commercial sector as the local and national economy recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic last year. Tom Crosse, GVM Auctioneers and Gordon Kearney, Rooney Auctioneers, have also reported that despite another impact of the coronavirus lockdown - that of working from home - demand for office space in the city remains high. Mr Crosse, who trades in Glentworth Street in the city, said: \"The warehousing market has been the big winner with all historically vacant units now occupied with new suitors either as purchase or investors.\" The demand for this type of space is not just because of a rise in online shopping, but also substantial price increases in Dublin, and the comparative lack of warehousing stock in the regions, he added. [articlepreview id=\"1004814\" link=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/1004814/have-property-prices-peaked-limerick-estate-agents-reflect-on-2022-and-look-at-the-year-ahead.html\"] Contributing to this, Mr Kearney said: \"There has been extremely low levels of construction of new warehouse and industrial space resulting in existing stock being in high demand with competitive biddings on most sales throughout the year.\" One thing which has impacted across the board when it comes to property, both residential and commercial, has been the rise in construction costs - both labour and materials. Mr Kearney, whose auctioneering firm is located in the city centre\\'s O\\'Connell Street, said it led to demand for development land dropping last year. But sales of commercial interest properties were very active in the first six months of 2022, something he puts down to negative interest rates being applied to large deposits held in banks. \"Large depositors sought a better return on their deposits and invested heavily in commercial investment properties and land,\" he explained. \"However, since positive interest rates have now returned, activity levels on commercial investment properties have waned somewhat.\" Mr Crosse says there has been a \"very robust\" local commercial market this year, with rental for office space up around 10% year-on-year. \"Rental levels in business parks is ranging from €15 to €20 per square foot with good grade A space in the city centre averaging €25 per square foot. “There appears to be growing interest in the good quality accommodation,\" he added. [articlepreview id=\"1004917\" link=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/1004917/limerick-people-urged-to-run-or-walk-to-support-work-of-milford-care-centre.html\"] In terms of commercial sales, GVM notably sold development sites in Kildare town centre - which will be used for a school - and land for a shopping arcade in Tullamore, Co Offaly. In October last, the flagship tenant at the city\\'s Opera Centre development, Revenue, admitted it would be reconsidering the number of people it planned to work at the heart of the space due to the rise in the number of people working-from-home.

The number of products unavailable to Irish doctors and pharmacies to treat patients has jumped by more than 15 per cent over the past month. Dominic Coyle has the details. More than 1,000 Irish businesses could go to the wall this year, costing creditors and others €3 billion-€4 billion, a report published on Monday warns. Between one and two businesses fail every day in the Republic, according to some calculations. However, a new PwC report warns that this could rise to more than 1,000 – almost three daily – this year, as the global recession bites more deeply in coming months. Barry O’Halloran reports. Emma Jacobs says it is time we culled the amount of meetings we have to attend.

       "  'title': 'Housebuilding activity contracts sharply for third month running',\n",
       "  'text': '“2022 was a year of two halves for construction,” said BNP Paribas Real Estate Ireland director and head of research, John McCartney. “Strong expansion between January and May gave way to slowing activity from June, and the year petered out with a further pronounced slowdown in December,” he said. The construction sector is in contraction territory due to “challenging economic conditions” which have hit market demand. The headwinds facing the industry include, supply chain delays, and high input prices. The fall in construction activity coincided with a reduction in new orders. New business decreased for the ninth consecutive month, and to the greatest extent since last August. This falling workload led firms to reduce staffing levels. Mr McCartney said: They initially took a wait-and-see approach to shrinking order books, maintaining their staff headcounts and continuing to purchase materials. “But after nine months of new business contraction, panelists have now begun running down stocks and not replacing employees who leave.” The survey recorded a drop in activity across the three construction categories, housing, commercial, and civil engineering. The softest fall in activity was seen on commercial projects, despite the rate of decline quickening from November. Some construction firms remain optimistic and have predicted a rise in development activity for 2023 as many expect the current economic environment to become less volatile. Mr McCartney said: Ireland’s construction firms retain a positive medium-term outlook, with a solid majority expecting to be busier this time next year. “This may reflect recent developments which should assist with current viability challenges. “Input price inflation has moderated to its slowest rate for 21 months,” he said. Mr McCartney also said the State’s Croí Cónaithe scheme will also help increase building activity as it is being implemented to subsidise apartment developments that would otherwise not be profitable to build. However, he said further government action is required if construction activity is to increase. “Relaxing mortgage restrictions and raising the shared equity scheme price ceilings, may also underpin builders’ confidence that they will be able to sell properties at prices that make development viable,” Mr McCartney said.',\n",

       "  'text': 'To put it in Michael Noonan-style parlance: the house is on fire but the lads are wondering how much use they’d get out of a hose the next day. Heartiest congratulations to the Department of Housing and all the local authorities around the country for their fiscal management this year. The gratitude of the nation too must go to 3,494 children who were homeless this Christmas for their contribution to this prudence. There was €66,000 for each one of them just sitting in the bank to build houses that never got spent. In a year when President Michael D Higgins declared a “housing disaster”, with record numbers of people in homelessness, €231m set aside for building houses went unspent. Homes, in other words, for people who are without a place to live. And that’s not an error. It’s not that there was an overspend on housing last year, when the challenges of record rent rises and 70,000 Ukrainian refugees were added into the equation. 2022 was quite the year. Remarkably, the housing budget still came in under the limit. And the kids who went homeless for Christmas because not enough houses were built – helped round up the Exchequer figures and bring in a budget surplus of €5bn. After all, a housing overspend would not have looked good on the balance sheet.And that’s what is important. The interchangeable finance ministers Michael McGrath and Paschal Donohoe were grinning away at their figures last week. The Coalition’s answer to the Kray twins are busy hoarding a pot of gold for a rainy day. The largesse of the Covid era is gone.Coming into 2023, real-world figures show a record 11,500 accommodated by homeless services near the end of 2022 – up over 25pc on the same period a year earlier. Renewed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says there are a number of pressing challenges that will define the rest of this Government’s term in office: “The first is housing.” He says the Government “must apply the same spirit of determination, action and immediacy that we saw during the pandemic to this the greatest challenge of today”.“We must do whatever it takes it solve this social crisis and reverse the trend of rising homelessness and falling homeownership. We will leave no stone unturned. No option taken off the table without due consideration,” he declared on becoming Taoiseach.This has become something of a slogan as he trotted out the same line this week when he met with a housing policy quango during the week. Due to a mix-up, Housing Minister Darragh O’Brien was curiously absent from his meeting with the Housing Commission. Varadkar has come on a bit since having a dispute with Micheál Martin around the Cabinet table about whether housing was the most important issue and whether it preceded protecting the economy. Now Varadkar is poetically promising “hope and housing”.But to “do whatever it takes” clearly doesn’t include telling councils they can go above their allocated budgets to deliver on housing targets at a time of unprecedented demand when unforeseen events occur.The fear of getting a rap across the knuckles from the department seems to outweigh any desire to “do whatever it takes”. It’s doubtful the Dáil Public Accounts Committee is going to haul a local authority chief executive across the coals for going a few million over budget in order to “do whatever it takes” to deliver houses.The warnings were there in the summer of a problem as spending was too slow. A euro in every five that was supposed to have been spent wasn’t. The blame at that point was being placed on “lower than anticipated spend on Local Authority housing due to ongoing economic issues impacting delivery” and on “wider challenges in the construction sector, including supply chain disruption”. The alarm bells were ringing loud.Come the end of the year and Donohoe is explaining that the “very high levels of inflation” had an impact on the delivery of new houses and the ability of local authorities to manage their budgets. The focus though has to be on the spending of every euro. “What myself and Minister Darragh O’Brien are aware of is the need to spend and spend well,” the public expenditure minister says.Inflation does drive prices up, making budgets harder to manage. Contracts have to be renegotiated and tenders put out again. Normally this would result in an overspend, but instead there was an underspend. The local authorities couldn’t get the housing across the line due to a shortage of manpower and supplies.But it also appears the pressure from red tape as costs increased and being afraid to go over budget, meant projects were stalled. Rather than logically going over budget – in the very year where it was most excusable – spending got postponed for another day. It was easier than getting caught over budget.During Covid-19, the coffers were thrown open, but now in the housing crisis we’re talking about watching every cent. So much for applying “the same spirit of determination, action and immediacy that we saw during the pandemic”. Nobody is suggesting the Government start burning money, but there has to be some acknowledgement that construction prices are gone up and the bang for the buck will be lessened.The slowdown in building starts is having knock-on effect for 2023 with O’Brien now admitting it will be a struggle to hit targets again this year. The excuses are already being lined up. The cycle continues. It’s not about a lack of investment. The capital spending on housing is the highest of any area of government, trumping even transport, and is at record levels. At a time when unprecedented resources are available, the Coalition literally can’t spend the money. Varadkar’s argument that delivery on housing will be the test of this Government’s success until the general election is correct. Reform of the health service, the cost of living, climate action and a potential recession shouldn’t go without a mention. The next election though will be about housing and who can show they have the solutions. Not being able to spend the funding allocated is hardly a ringing endorsement of Coalition policy.Putting out the fire can’t wait.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Fish producers welcome change to permit scheme for migrants',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Irish Fish Producers Organisation (IFPO) has welcomed the new permit scheme which will give non-EEA migrant fishers the same rights as EU crew members. IFPO chief executive, Aodh O Donnell says their members lobbied for the change and are delighted it has now finally come into effect. O Donnell says this employment permit system also offers a more streamlined process to crew members and vessel owners alike. The Department of Justice confirmed the new arrangements this week. Under the new scheme, all holders of a current valid permission to work as a non-EEA Crew member under the Atypical Working Scheme (AWS) in the Irish Fishing Fleet expiring on or after 1 January 2023 will be granted a Stamp 4 immigration permission. The new arrangements provide for legislative changes for non-EEA Crew in the Irish Fishing Fleet and to assist in the transition period to the Employment Permit system. O Donnell says this award of Stamp 4 permission is a “critical and much embraced change to the status of Crew employed in the Irish Fishing Fleet under the auspices of the problematic Atypical Working Scheme.” “Our members have worked hard with us, as a representative body, to support the right of all non-EEA migrant fishers to fair treatment and for fit for purpose permitting. This is positive news with the introduction of measures to protect migrant fishers and to grant them the full rights and entitlements under Employment legislation. This legislative change gives qualifying non-EEA crew the same full entitlements as EU crew and the option to avail of the share-based remuneration. Furthermore, the process of permitting is streamlined for both crew and vessel owners. Costs of administration are also radically reduced to the benefit of all stakeholders.” “In this regard we highly commend Minsters Charlie Mc McConalogue at the Department of Agriculture Food, and Marine and Damien English at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. They must be credited for sound leadership and for spearheading this much needed legislative initiative. In addition, we should point out that the seafood sector worked together and engaged proactively with the various government departments over the last year to deliver this outcome. The cooperation and support of the Civil Service is a paradigm for what can be achieved in the process of open, focused, and constructive engagement.” Niall Connolly Chairman of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation adds that ‘’we have been consistent in saying that our crews are the backbone of the traditional fishing activity. Ours is a professionally operated sector, committed to international best practice. These employees have valuable skill sets that are critical to our business and are much prized. We have shared goals, and we strive for continuity and international best practice’’. Barry Faulkner, Director of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation also acknowledged the support of the Minister for Marine and the delivery of an undertaking at a Protest meeting held in Kildare Stret on May 18th last year. ‘’Our vessel owners were joined in solidarity with our migrant crew colleagues to support them in a protest at Leinster House. This initiative was led by crew and skippers alike and aimed to raise awareness of much-needed legislative change to current permit schemes. The protest meeting was addressed by Minister Mc McConalogue. Whilst there are some technical implementation considerations, the Minister has delivered on an undertaking given to vessel owners and crew on that day’’. Aodh O Donnell says the “partnership with the crew members underpins the performance of our vessels to ensure a shared long-term future in a challenging international environment. This fit for purpose permit scheme is a key element of this universally welcomed change’’.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Shoppers must demand longer lasting goods and less packaging, says Fine Gael waste policy paper',\n",
       "  'text': 'Shoppers must be able to buy longer-lasting appliances and have packaging-free areas in supermarkets, a Fine Gael policy document says. The ‘circular economy’ paper also says the construction industry must improve sorting of demolition and building site waste so that materials can be reused.It urges immediate action to prevent the €700 in food waste clocked up by the average household in a year.The document comes from Fine Gael’s ‘Policy Lab’, an internal think-tank of party members and external experts.A survey conducted by the group found most people believed making changes in the goods they bought and how they used them would be difficult.Most of those quizzed had confidence they could find ways to reduce their food waste to zero and a narrow majority felt they could avoid fast fashion.But a minority felt it would be manageable for them to stop using disposable containers, avoid single use plastic, reduce their black bin waste to zero or achieve high energy efficiency in their home.Only small numbers felt they could easily downsize their home reduce energy and running costs and an even smaller proportion felt it would be possible to forgo car ownership in return for a local vehicle sharing scheme.Respondents reported poor options in their local area for the repair or upcycling of consumer goods.By contrast, two-thirds said recycling facilities were good or very good in their area but as recycling rates are not improving, that raises questions as to why those facilities are not being used more.The document, which echoes Green Party policies, comes as Green Minister for the Circular Economy, Oisín Smyth, works on drawing up waste reduction, recycling and reusability targets for business and industry.Most sectors have a mountain to climb.The construction industry in Ireland produces 9 million tonnes of waste per year and has a recycling rate of just 10pc.Around 170,000 tonnes of clothes are thrown out each year here and only 35pc get recycled.Packaging waste remains a major issue too but Richard Bruton, chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, said it was one of the ‘low-hanging fruits’ that government and consumers could tackle.He urged adoption of the model in France where large supermarkets had to dedicate a quarter of their space to unpackaged food items that shoppers could take home in their own reusable containers.He said government should work with businesses to encourage change first but mandatory measures might be needed later on.“You need to promote innovation in the first place but over time you will see these practices that are proven doable embedded in regulation.“You don’t start with the big gun of regulation, which may be inflexible. You start to create the incentives and you set the targets.”The paper calls for development of a ‘national innovation hub’ to build in sustainability at the design stage of goods, and the creation of a system of ‘marks of best practice’ to recognise sustainability in manufacturing.It urges the development of ‘sustainability networks’ to support community repair and upcycling services and it says government must use its influence in public procurement contracts to ensure the most sustainable goods and services were paid for with public money.Mr Bruton said the policy document was not an attempt to muscle in on the Green Party but to help Minister Smyth decide his targets.“This is a concept whose time has come. Hats off to the Greens who perhaps identified that before others but it’s something we definitely need to do now, and we are fully shoulder to the wheel to make this effective,” he said.',\n",

       "  'title': 'From increased spending to tax breaks, can the ideas discussed at summit fix the housing crisis?',\n",
       "  'text': 'Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he wants 2023 to be a “year of inflection” in the housing crisis – having called a housing summit today as a “point of reflection”. But what are the ideas discussed today, can they work, and if so, how quickly? Viability This seems to have been the biggest focus of the day. Sources at the meeting said that there was a major push from some of the property and development companies there to overhaul some Government schemes aimed at making stranded apartment blocks viable. Largely because of changed financing conditions and higher interest rates, some builders cannot complete units with planning permission because the financial models underpinning them no longer stack up. They’re asking for subsidised funding to kick in at the start of the development process, rather than the end, with two of Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien’s flagship schemes, Croí Cónaithe Cities and Project Tosaigh, in their sites. Afterwards, Varadkar also spoke about purchasing large quantities of homes in advance, guaranteeing a certain price for a percentage of a development and hence “derisking” it. With a shortfall in housing commencements, the aim is to convert permissions into units in 2024, when the drop-off is predicted to bite. Spending more There is obviously a relationship between the money available for housing and the level of outputs – O’Brien consistently points to significantly bigger capital budgets for housing compared with previous years, and how the Coalition is recovering from a decade of underinvestment (although the Minister insisted today this isn’t a dig at his Coalition partners). Varadkar today insisted there was no barriers to spending growing “so long as the economy is strong and so long as the public finances can support it”. “Of course we’re willing and want to spend more money resolving the housing crisis.” However, it’s not that straightforward. As the Department of Finance has previously flagged, there are constraints in the economy around sourcing enough workers, materials and the capacity of the planning system which can’t be solved with fistfuls of cash. Sourcing more workers Since 2019, rules governing trades like bricklayer and plasterer have been relaxed – removed from the list of occupations ineligible for employment permits. Many construction sector workers from outside the European Economic Area are eligible for a general employment permit. However, the Economic and Social Research Institute has called for construction trades such as carpentry and plumbing to be added to the State’s critical skills list. There is also an upturn in the number of people taking up apprenticeships, but the legacy of the crash, which tarnished the sector for a generation of young people and saw many tradespeople emigrate, still has a big impact here. The Taoiseach said today that Ireland is facing this challenge at the same time many other countries are competing for skilled labour, meaning the country may struggle to attract people in, no matter what reforms are adopted. Emergency homeless measures The eviction ban hasn’t been successful in stemming the flow of people into homelessness – at least not yet – with record figures released before Christmas. It is due to expire at the end of March – leading to fears that whatever impact it is having on suppressing new homelessness will evaporate and make the situation worse. O’Brien has been slow to call for an extension, mindful that doing anything seen to force small landlords from the market will not help his cause. Varadkar confirmed it was discussed at today’s summit, but he conceded there wasn’t unanimity on the issue. Other steps discussed today included prioritising people in emergency accommodation for social housing, but the Taoiseach again said some had warned of the “negative consequences of unintended consequences” arising from such a step. Expanding measures for renters Budget 2023 saw the introduction of an annual €500 in tax relief for renters. The measure does little to solve the underlying problems in the rental market but it does address, to an extent, some of the affordability issues renters face, even if it is not the step change they need. Politically, it’s seen as a bulwark against losing more and more younger voters, so more measures like this, or an enhanced version, could prove politically popular. Tax breaks Probably the most politically contentious, if only because the Opposition will salivate at the prospect of attacking a Fianna Fáil Housing Minister for introducing tax breaks to encourage property development. Nonetheless, it was discussed today, the Taoiseach saying that “nothing is off the table”. O’Brien has been guarded in his public comments, but behind the scenes proposals have been under development for some time. The theory goes that Michael McGrath may be more open to the idea than his predecessor in the finance brief, Paschal Donohoe. Targeted tax breaks for apartment development in urban areas, capital allowance tax reliefs or a cut in VAT are all under consideration, as are tax breaks for smaller landlords to encourage them to stay in the market.',\n",

A total of 19,660 new jobs were created by Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2022. The jobs growth translates into a net increase of 10,841 jobs created last year. Employment increased across Enterprise Ireland’s three core economic sectors – technology & services (up 8% on 2021), industrial and life sciences (up 5%) and food and sustainability (up 3%). Strong employment growth was reported in specific sub sectors such as climate, sustainability and agritech (up 13%); digital technology (up 9%); high tech construction and housing (up 6%); fintech, financial & business services (up 6%); the life sciences and engineering sectors both saw 5% employment growth. “A real positive of today’s results is the regional balance in terms of both new jobs created and total employment,” said Minister for Enterprise, Trade & Employment, Simon Coveney. “More than 147,000 people in the regions are now employed by Enterprise Ireland client companies, making an enormous contribution to local economies and communities. “The government’s target to have a record 2.5 million people employed by 2024 has already been exceeded. Enterprise Ireland has also exceeded its own employment target for 2022 with these results announced today. “I firmly believe that with a strong focus on innovation, digitalisation, sustainability and regional development, Enterprise Ireland will continue to enhance their significant contribution to growing and maintaining quality jobs in every region and county in Ireland.” Enterprise Ireland CEO Leo Clancy said: “Enterprise Ireland supported companies like Version 1 play a vital role in the Irish economy, employing more than 218,000 people in cities, towns and villages throughout the country and making an enormous contribution to local economies. “Supporting Irish-owned companies to achieve greater scale and expand their global footprint is a priority for Enterprise Ireland in 2023 and we are committed to supporting Irish companies on their journey to become global leaders in their field.

       "  'title': 'Engineering consultancy EDC opens new Galway office',\n",
       "  'text': 'Engineering consultancy EDC, which celebrates 20 years in business this year, has announced the opening of a new Galway office. Gerard Kirwan, Associate Director at EDC, will head up this new office located. The addition of this office will bring EDC’s Irish presence to four Irish offices for the company, complementing their international offices in London and Istanbul. Over the past two years, EDC has experienced impressive growth, expanding its team to one hundred people across six offices in Cork, Dublin, Limerick, London, Istanbul, and most recently, Galway. This growth is reflected in EDC’s increased market share in the UK and Ireland, with staff numbers doubling from the start of 2021 to the end of 2022. EDC estimates that this trend will continue, with an additional 25% increase in staff numbers by the end of 2023 to support the investment and growth in market share. In August 2022, the firm announced the opening of a new office in Istanbul, Turkey, expanding the company’s presence in the MENAT region to accommodate client demand and leverage opportunities within these regions. The Istanbul team continues to grow, allowing them to provide best-in-class MEP Design and BIM services in the region; and to facilitate growth, they have moved to larger premises to facilitate doubling the size of the Istanbul team over the coming 12 – 18 months. Commenting on the opening of the Galway office and the company’s continued growth, Richard O’Farrell, Managing Director of EDC, said “As EDC celebrates 20 years in business in 2023, this expansion into Galway is another exciting step forward for the company, and sets the foundation for future growth across Ireland and beyond. The expansion is testament to the incredible work our whole team delivers, and this is driving us forward to realise new opportunities.” O’Farrell continued “The move into Galway aligns with the EDC’s growth strategy, which in recent years has also included the opening of a Limerick office to service the Mid-West of Ireland, the expansion of the leadership team with the appointment of Associate Directors across all offices; the opening and expansion of our Istanbul office; and significant growth in staffing.” Commenting on the Galway office opening, Gerard Kirwan, Associate Director at EDC, said “I am proud to head up EDC’s fourth Irish office, which marks an exciting chapter in the story of EDC and demonstrates the extent of the company’s growth in recent times. The decision to open an office in Galway strengthens our delivery capabilities and increases our ability to service our current and future clients and sectors.” As a proudly forward-thinking engineering firm, EDC offers services within a range of construction sectors from residential, commercial, industrial, and pharmaceutical, to retail, hospitality and leisure; with a focus on delivering the most innovative and sustainable designs to ensure all projects achieve their net zero carbon and ESG objectives.

       "  'title': 'Minister Harris gives go-ahead for next phase of proposed capital investment for TU Dublin - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris has today announced that Technological University Dublin (TUD) has been given the go-ahead to proceed to the next phase of the project proposal development for a ‘Design & Construct’ Sustainable Building Centre on their Broombridge Campus. The project envisages the refurbishment of a building in TU Dublin’s satellite facility in Broombridge in order to utilise it for core academic space to address capacity. It is anticipated that the proposed state-of-the-art campus would build capacity for the greater Dublin Area and beyond. Minister Harris confirmed that TU Dublin has been successful under the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund (TSSPF) and is now approved to proceed to develop the preliminary business case for a multi-disciplinary teaching and learning facility at Broombridge. It is envisaged that the new building will serve students in the areas of Architecture, Engineering and Construction. Speaking today, Minister Harris said: “Today is a key milestone as we see TU Dublin emerge from the first part of a robust strategic assessment process, and move to the next phase of the project life cycle development, which will see the development of preliminary business case. “This proposed new building would accommodate 1,400 new learners in key skills demand such as retrofit, low carbon technologies, Modern Methods of Construction (MMC), and in energy efficiency. “It is anticipated that its creation would be a Beacon for Sustainability and Climate Action, creating a Retrofit hub in one of the largest residential areas requiring retrofit in the city. “Investment will play an important role in supporting the technological sector as drivers of regional development by allowing them to better meet the needs of learners in their region, to deepen existing and forge new relationships with business and enterprise and to respond in an agile fashion to future developments. “The HEA in advancing these capital proposals, is playing a crucial leading role in rolling out the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund ensuring a pipeline of key strategic projects delivers for our learner, economic and societal needs, and we need to keep these objectives at the heart of all our decision making. The outcomes of the preliminary business case stage will inform the development of a pipeline of projects and future capital investment decisions. “The proposal developments to be advanced under the Technological Strategic Projects Fund, including 5 nationwide already announced, will complement significant investment right across the technological sector and further education and training sector.” Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery, and Reform Paschal Donohoe, who attended TU Dublin with Minister Harris today, said: “Since its inception, the Technological University (TU) agenda has sought to transform the Higher Education landscape and support the delivery of a highly skilled workforce, capable of meeting current as well as future economic and societal challenges at a national and regional level. “This investment in TU Dublin through the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund (TSSPF), in addition to the significant Exchequer resources provided to date, further highlights the Government’s support for the development and delivery of the Government’s TU agenda. “Ensuring these Universities are well equipped to deliver on our national ambitions is key. In total, including the NTF, approximately €4.1bn will be allocated to the Higher Education, Further Education and Training (FET) and Research and Innovation sectors in 2023. This reflects the importance of these sectors to the economy and the Government’s commitment to support learners through them.” President of TU Dublin Professor David FitzPatrick, welcomed the announcement: “TU Dublin is delighted to commence 2023 with this hugely significant announcement for the University, our students and the local community in Dublin 7, which will deliver a world-class multidisciplinary learning and industry engagement environment for students across the faculties of Engineering & Built Environment and Computing, Digital and Data, from apprenticeship to PhD. “Critically, the research, knowledge generation and skills development activities undertaken in Design + Construct will provide creative solutions that will be core to the sector’s efforts in addressing its key sustainability challenges that are contributing to the Climate Crisis, acting as a living construction laboratory encompassing best practices in sustainable design and construction.” Ciarán McCaffrey, Head of Capital Programmes in the HEA, said: “We welcome today’s announcement that TU Dublin are to proceed to the next phase of project proposal development under the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund (TSSPF). “The TSSPF is a key driver in delivering on the ambitions of the technological sector, aiding the sector in meeting the increased demand for education and driving more balanced regional development. The HEA look forward to working with all Higher Education Institutions, whose proposals are moving to the next phase of the TSSPF, in developing their preliminary business cases.” ENDS',\n",

       "  'title': 'Housing Minister rules out introducing regulations on people renting out spare rooms',\n",
       "  'text': 'HOUSING MINISTER DARRAGH O’Brien has ruled out introducing regulations on homeowners who rent a spare room to students, saying that implementing rules would reduce supply. In response to a Parliamentary Question by Fine Gael’s Neale Richmond, who asked if rights available to typical renters would be extended to people living in rented rooms, O’Brien said that the Government had no plans to introduce new regulations. Under current legislation, the Residential Tenancies Board does not have authority over licence agreements for people who are renting a room in a house where the landlord also lives. Rented rooms, or “digs”, are typically used by students while attending college and have been in short supply in recent years, with campaigns by students’ unions being run to boost the number of people offering rooms. Currently, people can rent out a room in their home and make up to €14,000 in rent tax free through the Rent a Room Relief tax credit. There has also been a lack of availability in overall student accommodation in recent years, with the Government now set to part-fund the construction of an additional 667 student beds across an initial three colleges. Despite challenges within the sector, O’Brien says that he does not believe adding regulations to the sector will improve the availability of digs. “I do not consider that there is a need for a legal regulatory framework in this area. Digs accommodation is an integral housing solution that suits both lodgers and home owners, providing an important source of revenue and, in some circumstances, social interaction,” O’Brien said. “Any attempt at regulating ‘digs’ is highly likely to impact negatively on the supply of this traditional and important source of accommodation.” He said that people who live in digs “benefit from the goodwill that exists to ensure that both lodgers and home owners are happy with the arrangement”. “It is possible for the arrangements to be formalised by way of a licence between the parties, but this is a matter of choice for the parties themselves to agree on,” he added. Despite not having plans to introduce regulations, O’Brien added that it would be kept under review.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Are we waiting for an Irish recession which may never arrive?',\n",
       "  'text': 'The economy continues to hold up, despite pressures from the cost-of-living crisis. New Central Statistics Office (CSO) figures give insights into the impact on households of soaring inflation and how they are responding. Huge uncertainty remains and there is no doubt that we are seeing a sharp slowdown in growth. But with the multinational sector still contributing to growth and signs from the euro zone not as bad as anticipated, might 2023 again see the Irish economy hanging in? 1. Standard of living edging down The cost-of-living crisis is, of course, having a big impact. A key insight from the latest CSO figures is the hit on the disposable income of households – a measure of the standard of living. The real (inflation-adjusted) level of disposable income fell in the third quarter by around 0.4 per cent compared to the previous three months – and has declined in three of the last four quarters. It peaked in the third quarter of 2021, when it reached the highest level in the 24-year history of collecting the data. The longer term trend here was a big fall in living standards after the 2008 financial crash followed by a few years of not much change and then a strong recovery. The drop after the crash was around 11 per cent, based on the latest CSO figures looking at household disposable income. There followed a period when living standards bumped along before a rise started in 2015. They did not get back to their pre-financial crash peak until early 2107. By the third quarter of last year, living standards as measured by disposable income had risen by more than 30 per cent from their lowest levels after the financial crash. They have now fallen by 1.4 per cent from this peak. The big question is what happens next. Notably, the latest fall in living standards is due to higher inflation. People’s incomes have, on average, continued to rise – unlike in the wake of the financial crash, job numbers remain strong, unemployment is at a record low and wages, on average, are rising. Household earnings were up in the third quarter of 2022 as more people were in work – but soaring inflation outpaced this growth, leaving real incomes lower. That, if you like, is the bad news. 2. But savings are up and spending is solid The better news is that despite this, consumer spending has been quite resilient and also households – probably largely better-off ones – are continuing to accumulate significant savings. Savings were running at 19.5 per cent of income in the third quarter of last year, as shown by the latest CSO figures. According to a note from Davy economist Conall MacCoille: “This is an enormous buffer for many households to potentially sustain spending through the squeeze in real incomes from energy bills and elevated CPI inflation.” Savings rates here remain among the highest internationally and have transformed from the years before the financial crash – Irish consumers, chastened by the experience of the crash, are much more cautious now, a trend also evident in total borrowing figures, with net savings also boosted by debt being paid down, as well as more cash in the bank. Savings rates now are close to double the 10 per cent average in the years before the pandemic, even if they have fallen back from their pandemic lockdown highs when many normal spending routes – holidays, nights-out and so on – were closed off. Consumer spending also remains surprisingly resilient, despite the squeeze on incomes. Here we need to be careful to understand the impact of inflation. Households are spending more cash because prices are going up, but their money isn’t going as far as it did before. Nonetheless, the latest figures show a slight increase in the volume of consumer goods and services purchased during the third quarter. As this coincides with lower disposable income, it suggest households are dipping into savings a bit to keep up consumption. More recent CSO figures suggest that the squeeze on spending continues to tighten. Retail sales figures for the month, which look at spending on goods, show the total cash spend by consumers was up 3.6 per cent year on year in November, but the actual volume of goods this bought was down 4.2 per cent. The gap is explained by inflation and particularly the need by households to spend around 20 per cent more on energy bills. Excluding volatile car sales, the volume of sales was nonetheless up 3.5 per cent in November on the previous month. So far, household spending, a vital piece of the overall economic picture, while under pressure, is hanging in. Christmas trends will be interesting to watch. 3. What about the rest of the economy? The business sector is the other key part of the economy to watch. While forward-looking purchasing managers’ indices show nervousness and indicate a slowdown, employment remains strong. The latest official figures show a drop to 4.3 per cent in the unemployment rate and jobs website Indeed says the level of postings on its site remain 60 per cent up on pre-pandemic levels. Grant Thornton’s latest survey of Irish business also shows that attracting and retaining labour remains a key issue for Irish companies. So while we know of lay-offs and slowing recruitment in the tech sector – and the latest BNP Paribas index suggests that construction firms have also slowed hiring – there is still strong demand for people in many sectors and this is supporting wages as well as job numbers. Employment tends to be a lagging indicator when a slowdown hits, so these figures bear close watching going into 2023. But so far, given the hit to the economy and to businesses from higher prices, jobs have held up better than would have been expected. Recent figures also show that the export sector remains strong and we know that, driven by multinationals, this continues to lead to strong growth in GDP and even in figures such as Gross National Income which factor out some of the distortions from the multinational sector. The latest data shows that gross value added by industry in the State was 21 per cent – (or €17.8 billion) higher in the third quarter than in the same period in 2021- much of it driven by manufacturing, within which pharma and medtech remains dominant. The ICT sector grew, but at a slower pace – and will likely slow or decline this year. While much of the extra value added flowed back in profit repatriations and royalty payments, multinationals continue to support Ireland’s overall economic figures. Domestic businesses continued their bounceback from Covid-19 lockdowns. However some closures in areas such as the restaurant sector show that the combined impact of Covid and the cost-of-living crisis is taking its toll. 4. The bottom line The resilience of the economy here – and signs that the euro zone may not hit the deep recession which had been anticipated – give some cause for optimism that Irish growth can stay in positive territory this year. This will be supported by multinationals, while the cost-of-living squeeze will continue to put pressure on households and their spending. The consumer sector may thus face its own mini-recession and this will continue to put some domestic firms in trouble, with predictions of a jump in liquidations. But with strong savings in better-off households, overall spending levels will not see the kind of fall seen after the financial crash. The uncertain course of the war in Ukraine – and the implications of this for the world economy – mean the economic outlook for the Republic remains impossible to predict with any confidence. Sentiment has been shaken by the cost-of-living crisis and growth has slowed rapidly after the bounceback from Covid shutdowns in the domestic economy. But what we can say is that, so far, the impact of the cost-of-living crisis has been a good deal less dramatic than would have been expected.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Developer Johnny Ronan in €140m deal for Citi’s Dublin HQ',\n",
       "  'text': 'Johnny Ronan’s Ronan Group Real Estate (RGRE) has acquired Citigroup’s existing European headquarters on Dublin’s North Wall Quay. While the value of the deal has not been disclosed, RGRE is understood to have paid about €140 million to secure ownership of the property in the face of competition from UK-headquartered private equity property manager Henderson Park, and from developer Shane Whelan’s Westridge Real Estate. The offices at 1 North Wall Quay were offered to the market by agent Knight Frank at a guide price of €120 million last March. News of RGRE’s purchase of the property comes just six days after The Irish Times reported its completion of a €300 million deal with Citi to develop a new European headquarters for the US-headquartered banking giant at its Waterfront South Central site in Dublin’s north docklands. Citi is understood to be paying about €100 million to acquire the site, with a further €200 million being set aside for the construction of its new base. Due for completion in 2026, the bank’s proposed footprint will equate to roughly 60 per cent of the 430,000sq ft of office accommodation RGRE intends to develop as part of the wider north docklands scheme. Once Citi’s workforce is ready to move into Waterfront South Central and vacate the company’s current premises at 1 North Wall Quay, RGRE will take ownership of the building, with plans being put in place to transform the property into a 500,000sq ft landmark office capable of accommodating a major corporate occupier. RGRE completed its purchase of Citi’s existing headquarters with funding provided by Landfair, a company headed up by Colony Capital’s former managing director of investment management, Stefan Jaeger. During his tenure at Colony, Mr Jaeger worked in partnership with RGRE on its delivery of Irish and European headquarters for Amazon, Salesforce and Facebook owner, Meta. Commenting on his company’s completion of its two-part deal with Citi, RGRE chief executive Rory Williams said: “The choice of Waterfront South Central (WSC) as the future home of Citi in the European Union represents a major vote of confidence in the continued strength of the Irish economy. This demonstrates the increasing desirability of Dublin as a European base for leading global companies, especially in the financial and banking sectors. “Ronan Group’s expertise in delivering world-class buildings has also received a vote of confidence, as demonstrated by the institutional backing of our transaction to redevelop Citi’s current HQ at North Wall Quay.” Davinia Conlan, interim Citi country head for Ireland, said: “We are thrilled to have finalised the location for our new building in Ireland. Our aim is to develop a state-of-the-art, sustainable workplace with the highest standards of design and technology. This significant investment is a signal of our commitment to Ireland, to Europe and to our people.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Wave of small landlords selling investment properties, claims report',\n",
       "  'text': 'Approximately 40 per cent of property sales in the final three months of last year involved landlords selling their investment properties, according to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). The finding, contained in the SCSI’s latest annual report, appears to buttress the industry narrative that smaller landlords are being squeezed out of the market by stricter rent controls and higher tax burdens. The report found that increasing levels of buy-to-let properties were being put on the market, aggravating supply shortages in the rental sector. Landlord exodus It noted that on average 40 per cent of residential sale instructions to agents in the fourth quarter of 2022 were landlords selling their investment property. The SCSI linked the exodus of smaller landlords to “overly complex” rent legislation; low rental returns; and compliance with “onerous” housing standards. “The trend of private landlords exiting the market has serious implications for the supply of rental properties,” warned John O’Sullivan, chairman of the SCSI’s practice and policy committee. “SCSI agents are reporting that the supply of available units to rent is at one of the lowest levels ever experienced and they don’t believe the situation is set to improve in the short term,” he said, noting that almost eight out of 10 agents surveyed by the SCSI are of the view that individual buy-to-let second-hand rental units being sold at present will not be replaced in the rental market in the next two years. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has promised to introduce incentives to retain smaller landlords amid a pronounced decline in available rental properties. Property website Daft noted recently that there were just 1,087 homes available to rent nationally on its website as of November 1st, including just 345 in Dublin. In its report, the SCSI predicted house prices would continue to rise this year by an average of 2 per cent — 1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023 and a further 1 per cent over the course of the next three quarters — despite the dampening effects of inflation and higher interest rates, which have triggered reversals in other countries most notably the UK. While economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rate hikes have cooled the market, affordability and viability remain key issues, it said. It calculated that new homes remain unaffordable for first-time buyers in several counties. On the basis of a first-time buyer (FTB) couple having a combined annual income of €89,000 and being able to borrow €356,000, equivalent to four times gross salary as per the Central Bank rules, the SCSI estimates counties Kildare and Wicklow would be unaffordable based on average house prices by €27,000 and €74,000 respectively. Meath, Cork and Galway remain affordable to the average FTB couple with available purchasing power exceeding new homes prices by as much as €28,000, €8,000 and €21,000 respectively, it said. Direct impact On the wider issue of supply, the group said while new housing completions in 2022 are expected to be at their highest levels in approximately a decade, about 25,000, there is concern among SCSI agents that commencements and planning permission numbers are declining and that this will have a direct impact on the number of completions this year and possibly into 2024. It said its members had highlighted the cost of construction as a particular concern in relation to the supply of new homes with inflation and labour shortages contributing to higher costs. The SCSI estimated that based on current new housing completion projections there will need to be an increase of almost 8 per cent of new home output each year to 2030 to meet the Government’s Housing for All targets. This means the State would need to be building 27,000 new homes this year, rising to 39,000 in five years and over 45,000 by 2030.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Troy was the capital of a rich and powerful kingdom which fell to the Greeks by deception – the Trojan horse ruse, according to the Iliad. This episode in one of the oldest works of literature still widely read by modern audiences continues to cast a spell, including on hard-line loyalists convinced the Northern Ireland Protocol is another Trojan horse engineered to con them out of the UK. The trope of a plucky people weathering siege, a people who cannot be beaten by fair means but may be betrayed by foul, has enduring appeal to loyalism. Somehow, this endlessly convenient theme has managed to embed itself in the protocol narrative.Jeffrey “Hector” Donaldson has positioned himself as a strong leader protecting his citadel against predators, as Dublin and Brussels are characterised. Eventually, Troy’s Hector was outfought by the Greek warrior Achilles. But it needn’t always be a case of death or glory, a defeated opponent lashed to the victor’s chariot and his remains dragged around the city walls. Compromise is possible if the will is there. A big if, in this case.But nothing else will revive the North’s democratic institutions after a layoff of almost a year. When then-First Minister Paul Givan of the DUP resigned last February it effectively meant Stormont’s collapse. Bulldozing is easier than building, unfortunately. A reluctance to compromise has taken root, and it has been allowed to drift for too long.But there is always cause to hope. Positions can shift, especially if local politicians feel listened to when big-wigs arrive on their turf. Currently, a flurry of activity is happening north of the Border, with senior politicians from Westminster and Leinster House congregating for meetings and side-meetings, handshakes and the odd cold shoulder – stupidity on stilts from James Cleverly’s staff. Britain’s foreign secretary should have notched up an easy score in Belfast by sitting down with all five parties. But the exclusion of Mary Lou McDonald, which led to the SDLP staying away out of solidarity, turned it into a Whitehall bungle.Still, if we’re comparing putdowns, the latest decision by His Majesty’s government on border controls is a bigger snub than leaving the Sinn Féin leader out of a meeting. There’ll be other days and other meetings. But checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain, to ensure they comply with EU regulations, are another matter entirely for loyalism. They show which way the wind is blowing.Yesterday, Britain published legislation on border controls at ports which takes matters out of the Assembly’s hands. There will be a green lane – minimal paperwork and no routine checks – for goods from Britain staying in Northern Ireland, and a red lane for goods moving onwards to the Republic and into the EU. Here we have a sensitive spot for the DUP: in a show of strength, its agriculture minister Edwin Poots had construction of checking areas stopped – but the UK is now signalling intent to complete the facilities as part of its negotiations with the EU. This suggests an administration looking for a solution to the EU’s concerns rather than the DUP’s.A deal acceptable to the UK and the EU is the goal. A deal that also passes the DUP’s stress test naturally is desirable in the interests of harmony, but may not be possible – and at some point Rishi Sunak, who has said he’s working flat out to break the deadlock, will shrug, or pull a sad face. But the DUP’s objections won’t be allowed to block progress. On past form, the DUP will turn to the Conservatives’ ERG wing. Support from that quarter may be forthcoming – or the Tory hard right may be preoccupied with more pressing matters as strikes cripple Britain across multiple sectors.Mr Donaldson is no fool, and needs something he can sell to his base. Yesterday he said some progress was made on “technical issues” but there were “major political issues” not yet addressed. Political issues, of course, are the reason the DUP is anti-protocol – fear of being edged out of the UK’s Elysian Fields. Nothing to do with a trade pact which gives Northern Ireland a less awful Brexit than other parts of the union. Let’s not forget the protocol itself is a compromise and a majority of MLAs favour it. As does a majority of the broader population.The DUP is illogical in complaining trade checks distinguish it from the rest of the union when the party has had no problem with other differences, from an armed police force to abortion law to Sunday trading restrictions. Nor is there any consistency in the DUP boycotting the Assembly, while continuing to sit at Westminster – where the protocol was passed into law. Little wonder people wonder if what’s at issue here is a party unable to manage peaceful transition of power.Politics in Northern Ireland continues to quiver on the verge of collapse, with the region being run yet again by its civil servants, hardly an example of democracy in action because they have no mandate from the people. The cost-of-living and healthcare crises demand local politicians making decisions locally.Talk-talk is preferable to the alternative, but none of what’s happening currently is particularly democratic. The Assembly lying idle represents a fundamental lack of respect for democracy by the DUP, although the party argues its proposed boycott was in its manifesto. What a topsy-turvy world, when an electoral result is interpreted as a vote not to enter government. A generation on from the Good Friday Agreement – a shining example of compromise, but one which the DUP didn’t sign up to – people deserve better of those elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly (or Norlin Airlin Assemblie in Ulster-Scots, in case you’re interested).It’s in the North’s best interests to give the DUP some life jackets to reactivate the Assembly. Must needs. But let’s bear in mind that life’s heroes aren’t the grandstanders rattling their shields and making ostentatious or bellicose speeches. True heroics lie in grafting to deliver improvements for the community. That’s what the art of politics is really about.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin TD, today announced an open call for applications for a new funding scheme aimed at enhancing civic society engagement across the island of Ireland. The Shared Island Civic Society Fund will promote practical North South cooperation and engagement, across a range of sectors and themes, consistent with the objectives and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement. It will encourage and support civic society and community organisations to further strengthen existing partnerships and/or to develop new cross-border links, to build connectivity on issues of concern for the island of Ireland. The scheme, which has been developed as part of the Government’s Shared Island initiative and supported through the Shared Island Fund, will provide €500,000 to cross-border projects in the first year of operation. It is expected that increased funding will be made available in future years. The Fund will support regional, national and sectoral cross-border civic engagement in areas including Climate and Environment; Community development; Heritage and conservation; Social Enterprise; Charity and Voluntary Sector, and Sport. Announcing the launch of the Fund in Armagh, the Tánaiste said: “I am pleased to launch this initiative, which will complement the vital work that is already supported through my Department’s Reconciliation Fund and other funding schemes, to promote North South cooperation and enhance cross-border civic, economic, cultural, and political links across the island. “Civic society often provides a unique dynamic for building understanding and consensus in areas where politics alone cannot. There is already deep and constructive cooperation within civic society and it is encouraging to see so many organisations already collaborating on an all-island basis, combining ideas and capacity to deliver benefits far beyond what can be achieved separately. “However, for civic society to flourish, it requires support. This Fund will reinforce the important civic engagement already taking place and support new and innovative cross-border civic initiatives, with North/South or East/West dimensions. “We are enabling civic society to develop new links, forums, and projects that will help to build a truly shared island. “I strongly encourage civic organisations North and South to apply.” Applications for funding under the Shared Island Civic Society Fund will be accepted from Monday, 16 January 2023 until Monday, 27 February 2023. Further information, including eligibility and application process details, is available at https://www.dfa.ie/about-us/funding/sharedislandcivicsocietyfund/. ENDS',\n",

       "  'title': 'Machinery Focus: Vertical take-off for Tyrone Trailers',\n",
       "  'text': 'Meath Farm Machinery has long set out its stall as being associated with quality equipment, and it has recently added Tyrone Trailers to its list of franchises, a make that it believes fits right in with this philosophy. Tyrone Trailers is a relative newcomer to the machinery business although its founder and managing director, Declan McMoran, has been crafting trailers and other machinery for over 25 years. Manufacturing hotspot Co. Tyrone itself has become an engineering hub over the last few decades with a large number of companies supplying the quarrying and construction industries located there. Little surprise then that from this pool of engineering talent and expertise there has arisen a new company with the same ethos of building strength and quality as that of the multinationals supplying the construction industry. Like many engineering companies, pinning down an exact birth date is a difficult quest, however, Declan had started making trailers on a part-time basis for a friend in 2018, going full-time in 2019, and he has not looked back since. Application of expertise The impetus to go full-time came when Declan suddenly realised that he had nine trailers on order – as well as a day job. It was sink or swim time, so he took the plunge and last year the 20 staff that now work for the company produced 280 trailers for sale in Ireland, the UK and Europe, with the Nordic countries in particular being a strong market for the company. This is, by any measure, a spectacular growth rate and it has been helped by the arrival of Kevin McSorley as sales manager, whose experience in selling heavy equipment abroad has been invaluable. Herein lies the key to the design of the product, it is heavy engineering scaled down rather than light engineering scaled up; there is a solidity about the trailers wherever you look. Shopping list Meath Farm Machinery first became aware of Tyrone Trailers when the company went out looking for a new loader to use themselves for recovery work. They had a list of requirements in mind, the chief one being that it had to be well built and well finished, it would be seen behind a John Deere whenever it was out on the road after all. The trailer they eventually purchased from the company has a length of 30ft and a gross weight of 30t, giving a carrying capacity of 22.5t. It has two fixed and one steering axle, all on steel springs. As yet, no customer has requested air suspension, although Declan is by no means averse to fitting it if required. The rear ramps are are hydraulically adjustable for width and spread to 2.9m to accommodate combine harvesters and other wide-tracked machinery, a facility bolstered by outriggers giving another 15cm to either side of the deck. 20t pull At the front sits a 10t hydraulic winch which is mounted strongly enough to enable the use of a snatch block, thus doubling its capacity to 20t. Big hydraulic winches are not cheap, but the beauty of running them from a tractor’s hydraulics is that they are a lot quicker than relying on a 12v trailer plug to supply the power. The deck is of 50mm timber, except for the steel plates sitting above the wheels. These were specified by Meath Farm Machinery to avoid a build-up of mud and dirt on the wood, which would shorten its life. This ability to fully customise the specifications of the trailer is another strong attraction for customers, according to Kevin. Tyrone Trailers build to spec Buying a trailer is not simply a matter of choosing the colour, there is always a discussion with the customer as to what he intends the trailer to be used for, as this will help ensure his needs are met. In the case of Meath Farm Machinery, the recovery of large machines, such as harvesters, would be the most demanding task asked of it, and so the trailer was designed and built with this in mind. The ramps, winch, axle arrangement, outriggers etc., were all requested by Meath Farm Machinery when ordering the trailer, and despite the manufacturer’s heavy workload, they were all incorporated into the final item. One point to note from the rapid growth of Tyrone Trailers is that it was not overly held-up by material shortages, which is something often complained of elsewhere in the industry. Steel supply did not hold up production to any great extent, and it appears that component availability has returned to something like normal, with shipment delays easing as more containers become available globally. Two-month delivery The company quotes a lead time of around eight weeks and is happily continuing to take orders for its whole range, which includes dump trailers as well as low loaders. Prices are also said to have stabilised. As to the future then, while it is the agricultural/construction contractor market which provides the mainstay of its business, it is intending to enter the commercial vehicle sector with bespoke low loaders later this year. Tyrone Trailers may be a young company, but it is coming from an area steeped in engineering and managed by people who know the business and how to work with steel. As yet, despite its immediate success, it has to make its presence felt fully on the Irish market, but with the quality of build shown in this particular example, that may not be too long in coming.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Oxfam calls for wealth tax as the number of Ireland&#039;s super-rich doubles in a decade',\n",
       "  'text': 'Despite a drop from nine to eight in the number of Irish billionaires following the death last year of Indian-Irish construction magnate Pallonji Mistry, Oxfam said the number of Irish people who earn more than $5m (€4.6m) has also doubled in the past ten years. According to Forbes, which Oxfam uses to track global individual wealth, Limerick brothers John and Patrick Collison top Ireland’s rich list with individual wealth of $8.1bn (€7.5bn) each. Oxfam said their combined wealth of €15bn is more than the €10.3bn in wealth held by the entire bottom 50% of the population. The Oxfam report said that, globally, the richest 1% have acquired nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of humanity over the past two years. “This rising wealth at the top and rising poverty for the rest are two sides of the same coin, proof that our economic system is functioning exactly how the rich and powerful designed it to,” Oxfam Ireland’s CEO, Jim Clarken said. “A wealth tax on elite Irish wealth at graduated rates of 2%, 3% and 5% above a high threshold of €4.7m would raise €8.2bn annually, with the potential to transform Irish public services in health, housing and education while also delivering on our international and climate commitments,” he said. Third on Ireland’s rich list is US financier John Grayken who founded private equity firm Lone Star Funds and who took Irish citizenship in 1999. Telecoms magnate Denis O’Brien is fourth, followed by British hedge-fund manager John Armitage who took Irish citizenship in 1999. Campbell’s Soup heir John Dorrance III is sixth followed by financier Dermot Desmond who Forbes says has an individual wealth of €1.9bn. Eugene Murtagh who founded building materials giant Kingspan is eighth on the list. According to Forbes, John Collison aged 32 remains one of the world’s youngest billionaires positioned 13th on the list. His 34-year-old brother Patrick is 20th on the list of youngest billionaires. Oxfam said money derived from new wealth taxes was urgently needed by ordinary people. \"Entire countries are facing bankruptcy, with the poorest countries now spending four times more repaying debts to rich creditors than on healthcare,\" Mr Clarken said. \"Three quarters of the world’s governments are planning austerity-driven public sector spending cuts — including on healthcare and education — of $7.8 trillion over the next five years,” They said inequality has led to the World Bank announcing that the world has almost certainly lost its goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030. The Oxfam report was published as economic leaders meet in Davos. The WEF’s annual Global Risks Report showed the threat of recession, the cost-of-living crisis and mounting debt distress will dominate the outlook for the next two years. The World Bank this week slashed its growth forecasts for most countries and regions, and warned that new adverse occurrences could tip the global economy into a recession. The CEOs of Moderna and Pfizer will also be speaking at the summit, with one panel devoted to how fast vaccines can be created the next time a pandemic hits. The future of work will also feature. Whether to return to the office, as well as the rise of “quiet quitting” and the four-day week.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Michael Stone profile: the quiet engineering pioneer caught up in Paschal Donohoe posters furore',\n",
       "  'text': 'MICHAEL Stone is described by associates as an intensely private and quietly impressive man who would recoil at the exposure he is now getting for paying to put up Paschal Donohoe’s election posters in 2016. The 54-year-old engineering and construction entrepreneur, who began his career as an apprentice with the ESB before founding the very successful Designer Group (DG) in 1992, is known within his industry as reserved yet driven.Advisers who have worked on deals with him say he is low-key but confident, and expert in his field but humble enough to take advice on subjects outside his domain.Known for his early arrivals in his firm’s office in Blanchardstown, Dublin, his ambition and professionalism grew DG from a start-up to one of Ireland’s leading electrical and mechanical engineering firms.Over 30 years, Mr Stone has retained 100pc ownership of the company, developing it into an international specialist with a blue-chip client list boasting Google, Amazon, Diageo and a host of high-profile public-sector projects in Dublin.Before Covid knocked the construction sector back for a couple of years, DG achieved turnover of €250m from operations in Ireland, the UK, Europe and Africa.For the year ending March 2022, DG had turnover of €175m and profits of €18m, including the proceeds from selling 50pc of a joint venture in a facilities management firm to its partner, Sisk.In the last two years, the company took nearly €5m in Covid wage subsidies too.Mr Stone has not taken any dividends from the firm in recent years, despite €36m in cash in hand. But directors’ remuneration is generous at €2.9m.The company does not disclose the compensation of key personnel, but Mr Stone is doing well enough financially to have bought a sprawling mid-century mansion in Killiney, south Dublin, last April for €4.6m – below the list price of €5m.A promotional video for the home by estate agents Sherry FitzGerald shows extensive and exuberant gardens with dramatic views across Killiney Bay.Characteristically, the house is hidden on a quiet lane behind tall hedges and a heavy security gate.But even though Mr Stone doesn’t court public attention for his achievements, he has nonetheless become a person of influence.He was a ministerial appointee to the Land Development Agency (LDA) in December 2021 and acted as chair for the agency’s first three meetings in January, February and March last year, reverting to a non-executive director role once former Goodbody corporate finance director Cormac O’Rourke assumed the chair in April.Mr Stone has waived his remuneration fee since the outset of his involvement with the LDA and does not claim expenses.The avid Dublin GAA supporter has also chaired the North East Inner City Initiative – in Mr Donohoe’s constituency – since 2017, where he has compiled a lengthy list of accomplishments, including community festivals; training and education initiatives; action against crime and drugs; and several sport and recreation programmes.As Construction Industry Federation (CIF) president in 2015 and 2016, Mr Stone was determined to rehabilitate the reputation of the industry after the catastrophe of the financial crisis.“We have been lying down and taking a beating for too long,” he told magazine in 2015.“Our members have not made huge amounts of money at the expense of the Government or the people of Ireland. We have built and delivered projects that have allowed people to go to work, school, college and receive treatment in our hospitals. We should be proud of what we are achieving.”In a callback to his own professional origins, he promoted the value of apprenticeships during his CIF tenure, pushing member firms to invest in their own training and development programmes as a pathway into the industry. He has made that same emphasis at DG, where 170 of its 750 Irish staff came up as apprentices.Those who have worked alongside Mr Stone praised him for his progressive approach as CEO of DG, investing in technological innovation to create a more hospitable workplace for women. “Employers need to provide better facilities for women,” he told in a 2018 interview.“I think a lot of building sites traditionally are not set up in a way to allow women to work comfortably. My own opinion is that the secret to getting more women involved in the industry is the further development of off-site fabrication.”DG’s innovative approach has made the company a favourite of tech firms, pharma companies and brewers such as Guinness.In addition to projects at famous private addresses such as St James’s Gate, in recent years DG has been central to several major public-sector projects. The company’s vans are seen everywhere on the capital’s streets.A partial list of highly visible projects includes the construction of Technology University Dublin’s Grangegorman campus with Sisk, high-spec installs at Trinity College’s business school and bioscience facility, a fit-out at Dublin Castle and the refurbishment of Government Buildings and Leinster House in 2018.Attempts were made to contact Mr Stone via his company but messages were not returned.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Republic using productivity boom to invest public infrastructure and housing – Slugger O'Toole\",\n",
       "  'text': 'A typically spunky piece from the New Statesman’s new columnist Wolfgang Münchau starts with a great quote from Otto von Bismarck: “Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others.” He has Angela Merkel in his sights. He notes that despite the appearance of economic success, her austerity policies have led to a public investment shortfall in public investment of some half-a-trillion pounds, with the dire consequences only leeching up from the ground slowly in a series of spectacular shortfalls. He cites a motorway linking the north and south of Germany which has been closed because there’s no money to repair a bridge that’s become unsafe, and one Bundeswehr general has warned the army is so underfunded it cannot fight a war for more than a few weeks. He accuses Merkel of not being interested in solving problems, something he argues you can get away with until they accumulate and blow up in your face. Germany has relied on cheap Russian gas to sustain old industries so many sectors have missed the digital revolution. Productivity has fallen through the floor. Münchau recommends higher public investment as a way to levering it back up again on the basis that even a modest increase in productivity ‘would have a disproportionately large effect on the government’s ability to borrow’. So, finally, to Ireland. There have been worries about the fact the current coalition government has been throwing caution to the wind and doing the opposite: borrowing like crazy to fund infrastructure investment and critically from a political point of view, housing. According to Cliff Taylor there is a gap growing in the government’s plans in the south to calm a housing crisis which burgeoned out of af largely inactive period from the time of post crash ghost estates, until the present government set out its plans in the summer of 2020: The end of the era of super-low interest rates is the fundamental reason. For years, house building and the wider construction sector was funded almost exclusively by the Irish banking sector, via loans to builders and developers and also mortgage borrowers. Irish banks were in on both sides of an over-inflating market. Then, after the crash, Irish banks stepped out in terms of lending to developers and international funds stepped in. But now, as interest rates rise, the game has changed for these investors. When you can get a safe return of 3.5 per cent for putting your cash into US government bonds, the profit needed to justify investment in Irish property goes up. Meanwhile the cost of building has shot upwards. The economics of building apartments – already challenging – is now undermined and even house building becomes more financially difficult. So the international investors are stepping out. And with domestic builders also hit by higher costs and the Irish banks still loath to extend their lending to the property sector, there is a funding gap. The Irish government is now planning to offer support… …effectively giving a Government guarantee to buy some or all of certain projects when completed. In turn, this would help builders and developers to get finance from banks or investors to get schemes under way and finish them. It is also eyeing up some 70,000 planning permissions that have already granted and hoping that if can these could be got moving, it would make a huge difference to the figures. But, and this where the contraction of the two former dominant parties at local level hurts… Development efforts by local authorities and State agencies seem painfully slow and there is often little sense that everyone is pulling in the one direction. Local politicians try to secure their positions by objecting to many projects. Whoever is in government will face the same problem of “getting things done” when faced with a dysfunctional system, and a Nimby culture. Against this background, the challenge now for the Government is to ensure that the bucks being thrown into housing – probably €5 billion or more this year when the cost of tax incentives is added to direct spending – generate the required bang. Luckily (because of the presence of multinationals) productivity in the south is not the burden it is in the UK or Germany. The sun is shining in the south (€12bn or £10.5bn in corporation tax receipts in 2020) and the government is mending (and building) roofs. As Münchau notes of Liz Truss’s failed productivity experiment: It is not the debt that is the problem, but what you do with it.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Ministers Harris and Ryan welcome record number of enrolments in retrofitting programmes for 2022 - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris TD together with Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan TD have today welcomed the significant progress being made in the number of participants in Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB) and Retrofit upskilling and reskilling programmes in 2022. Following progress in developing a national network of Centres of Excellence in retrofit skills training, including NZEB skills, the number of workers availing of these opportunities has increased steadily since the first centre was opened in 2020. Numbers have risen from 363 to 793 enrolments in 2021 and to a record 2,034 enrolments in 2022. This reflects an increase of 118% between 2020 and 2021, and 156% between 2021 and 2022. Minister Harris said “I am delighted to see the increased uptake of these important courses. We are on track to having the highly knowledgeable and skilled workers needed to meet workforce needs between now and 2030. “With the opening of the ETB Centres of Excellence, the capacity for workers looking to upskill in the area of Green Skills is there. As demand for retrofit increases there will be significant employment opportunities and I would encourage anyone in the construction trade to get onboard and help us build warmer, more energy efficient homes. “Last year also saw the establishment of a dedicated Construction and Green Skills Programme Office within SOLAS. Working with ETBs nationally, this office is focused on developing programmes and initiatives to drive forward this reform agenda with a particular focus on the construction sector. “The government has set an ambitious target to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030 and the increased numbers enrolling on NZEB courses and establishment of the SOLAS Programme office are important steps towards delivering on this target.” Minister Ryan said: “Last year we met our target to retrofit 27,000 homes. This year we aim to retrofit 37,000 and I have no doubt we will make that target also, and then, those beyond that. The pipeline of interest is huge. People up and down the country are clamouring to make their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run. “The one way we can keep up with this demand is to ensure that we have enough highly skilled people to respond to it. The increased numbers we are seeing committing to these NZEB courses is so encouraging. And while it means that more and more homes can become better houses to live in, it also means that thousands of workers with valuable green skills can be sure that they have work for years, if not decades into the future. Green jobs are also sustainable jobs for the longterm.” The skills training is provided in a number of further and higher education facilities including at Centres of Excellence operated by Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB), Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board (LOETB), and Limerick Clare Education and Training Board (LCETB). Courses are also delivered in Cork ETB and Mayo-Sligo-Leitrim ETB with further provision due later this year and in 2024. The courses are free, fast and flexible with weekend and evening provision available. In many cases, where a person has an existing construction-related qualification, knowledge or experience, they can learn these skills quickly, usually within three-four days. Those in the sector interested in upskilling can find out more details by visiting gov.ie/therightcourse. The National Construction Training Campus in Mount Lucas also provide a 1 day tailored introductory programme for Transition Year and Leaving Cert students to give them a better understanding of NZEB principles while using a mixture of practical skills and theory. Retrofitting is both an important economic activity, and critical in meeting Ireland’s climate targets, and the delivery of the Government’s Housing for All plan. Nearly Zero Energy Buildings have a very high energy performance, with renewable sources as their dominant energy source. Making homes more energy efficient through retrofitting not only makes homes warmer and more comfortable, but can help households save money on bills and help to reach climate goals. ENDS Notes to the Editor The recently published Climate Action Plan 2023 (CAP23) sets out the actions required to halve our emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. The SOLAS Green Skills for FET Roadmap 2021-2030 was launched in March 2022 incorporating the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and the Green Skills Action Programme which began in 2021. The National Recovery and Resilience Plan committed €29m to NZEB and Retrofit upskilling and reskilling programmes and €10m to green skills modules, and includes the provision of 4,550 retrofit and NZEB standard places and 60,000 green skills places by the end of 2022. Alongside courses in NZEB and retrofit, a national suite of Green Skills programmes is currently being developed by SOLAS in collaboration with enterprise partners for blended delivery by ETBs in areas such as sustainability awareness and resource efficiency to assist in delivering on these challenges. A SOLAS eCollege course on a general Introduction to Green Skills was developed in partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. This was launched on 28 November 2022 and gives a taster insight into sustainability at home and in work.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Scotland’s construction sector faces a “major task ahead” to recruit workers – with industry bosses estimating almost 20,000 more staff will be needed over the next five years. A new report from the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) showed some 19,550 extra workers – 3,910 a year – will be required to meet demand in the sector between now and 2027 in Scotland.There is demand for workers for infrastructure projects, private housebuilding and repair and maintenance work, according to the annual construction skills network report.As part of its efforts to boost recruitment, the CITB has recently launched its employer network pilot project – which helps local firms recognise their training priorities.In Scotland, the pilot is being led by the Scottish Civils Training Group, with an initial focus on supporting employers from Inverness.In addition to this, the CITB’s Scottish Academy for Construction Opportunities awarded £1.3 million of funding to help support 1,000 job starts across the Highlands and Islands in a bid to reduce the skills gap.CITB Scotland engagement director Ian Hughes stressed that while the sector will “certainly face challenges heading into the new year”, the new report also showed there is “a lot of opportunity available for Scotland”.Mr Hughes said: “Despite the economic challenges, there is still huge demand for more workers in the industry and it will become even more important to retain our current workforce over the next 18 months.“There are a range of projects set to bring a steady stream of work into Scotland this year, including the new River Clyde bridge, Scottish Water’s £5 billion capital investment plans and £200 million towards Scottish Gas Networks mains replacement, to name a few.“These opportunities in the infrastructure and industrial sectors will be major drivers for growth in Scotland.”He continued: “Supporting the industry in attracting and retaining talent from right across Scotland will be our main priority, with a particular focus on training routes.“There’s no denying we have a major task ahead but I feel inspired by the resilience shown from industry over the last couple of years and look forward to supporting industry in emerging stronger when the recession ends.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Government getting ready to bail out the developers again',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Government is now considering the possibility of “advance purchasing” large numbers of private-sector apartment blocks that already have planning permission but haven’t yet been built for one reason or another. If Ministers were to proceed with this proposal, it would represent the biggest bailout of the property development sector in Irish history. The ballpark estimate is that developers have accumulated planning permission for at least 70,000 residential units – the vast majority of them apartments – granted by An Bord Pleanála or local authorities over the past four years that haven’t been “activated”. This phenomenon is at least partly due to the hoarding of land for its speculative purposes. But there is another major reason: the construction of high-rise, high-density apartments has become “economically unviable” because of higher interest rates and escalating inflation in the cost of building materials. The high-rise, high-density model – predominantly for exclusively build-to-rent (BTR) schemes – has turned out to be unbuildable due to the multiplicity of smaller apartments, generally studios or one-bedroom units, involved in most schemes. Each one requires kitchen and bathroom facilities, as well as extra fire safety precautions such as sprinkler systems. [ Frank McDonald’s future Dublin: Prepare for floods. Lose the ugly bridge. Dig an underground ] There is a bitter irony in all of this, because it was as a direct result of lobbying by the property industry that the planning system was upended in 2016 to permit developers bypass local planning authorities and make direct applications to An Bord Pleanála for large-scale housing schemes of 100 units or more. If sustainable residential communities are to be created, the BTR schemes that have planning permission would need to be redesigned to include a better mix of apartment sizes The changes were brought in by the then minister for housing Simon Coveney and they became even more prevalent after his successor, Eoghan Murphy, bowed to further pressure in 2018 and introduced mandatory ministerial planning guidelines that dumbed down apartment design standards to facilitate BTR schemes and promoted more high-rise development. These changes opened the floodgates to a torrent of applications to An Bord Pleanála for high-rise, ultra high-density apartment blocks in Dublin and elsewhere that were usually approved. [ Frank McDonald: Dundrum scheme’s overwhelming scale an indictment of the system ] The strategic housing development (SHD) process brought An Bord Pleanála, for the first time, into direct contact with developers and their agents; architects, planning consultants, chartered surveyors, structural engineers and others involved in what was aptly dubbed the “planning-industrial complex”. Its physical legacy is already visible in random high-rise eruptions on the skyline, including numerous BTR apartment blocks built at ultra-high densities. What’s waiting in the wings to be “activated” is yet more of the same type of schemes, largely comprising small flats on long corridors with no private amenity space and views out in only one direction. They are what the Government would be bringing into being if it was to embark on an “advance purchasing” programme of apartment developments with ready-to-go planning permissions, thereby “de-risking” private-sector developers – as the property lobby wants – and clearing the way for new homes to be built at scale, irrespective of their quality as places to live. The densities of many of the these unbuilt schemes are extraordinarily high. As the Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance has pointed out, these range from 330 units per hectare (uph) at Davitt Road in Inchicore to 347 uph at Clarehall on Malahide Road, 609 uph on the Circle K garage site in Donnybrook and 626 uph at Newmarket, in the Liberties. If sustainable residential communities are to be created, the BTR schemes that have planning permission would need to be redesigned to include a better mix of apartment sizes, with more two- and three-bedroom units, rather than an overwhelming preponderance of cell-like studios or one-bed apartments, intended to extract the maximum level of profit from rent. [ Frank McDonald: MetroLink will lay waste to chunks of the city centre but won’t integrate city transportation ] The Department of Housing has now revoked the “specific planning policy requirements” introduced in 2018 to permit lower design standards for BTR schemes. In a circular quietly issued to all planning authorities on December 22nd, it said “all apartment developments shall now adhere to the same standards ... regardless of the development type”. Advance purchasing of apartment blocks intended for the BTR market will also be extremely expensive, compared with units built directly by local authorities or approved housing bodies. For example, 14 two-bed social housing units in a high-rise scheme now under construction at Eglinton Road in Donnybrook were priced at €762,916 each – and that was back in 2020. It would be infinitely preferable if the Government were to adopt the latest idea put forward by industry lobby group Property Industry Ireland calling for European-style “low-rise, medium-density” housing at 40 to 80 uph as a more viable way of realising the declared objective of the National Planning Framework to achieve compact growth in cities and towns. The fact that this idea is now being put forward by the industry itself is an implicit admission that the whole SHD process – now mercifully ended – was an abject failure and that previous advocacy of the “high-rise, high-density” model helped in no small way to lead Ireland down the wrong road in terms of sustainable urban development.

       "  'text': 'Applications are open for the Niamh Burke Memorial Bursary, which will award a total of €10,000 to students pursuing studies linked to climate action and renewable energy in Ireland. The bursary was established by leading law firm Arthur Cox, in memory of their former colleague and Arthur Cox partner, Niamh Burke, who played a significant role in the development of the Irish wind energy sector and advised on some of Ireland’s largest, energy, infrastructure and construction projects. All relevant disciplines are open for consideration including law, economics, engineering, policy, science, planning and others. It is open to students planning to study in these or related fields in Ireland, at postgraduate level in 2023. If more than one person is selected, the bursary monies will be split between the successful applicants. “A year on and I still feel honoured to have been given this tremendous opportunity,” said one of last year’s winners, Aoife Stewart, from Drogheda in Louth. “The bursary provided me with vital financial support to pursue a masters in Environmental and Natural Resources law, which I am currently undertaking at University College Cork. “I have just completed the first semester of the programme and I am delighted with my decision to pursue a masters in this field. I am excited to continue my studies this year and to see where this degree leads me in the future.” Alex McLean, head of the energy and natural resource group at Arthur Cox said: “We are very pleased to continue providing this bursary in memory of our colleague Niamh Burke. Ireland has the potential to be at the forefront of the energy transition and we want to support the next generation who are working towards a carbon-neutral future.” The bursary was launched in 2020 and has already helped six people with their studies. It is funded by Arthur Cox and Niamh Burke’s family, to offer opportunities to a new generation of renewable energy experts. The fund is administered by Wind Energy Ireland. Dave Linehan, head of research, Wind Energy Ireland said: “Anything that supports and encourages academic excellence in this area is very welcome. Today’s renewable energy students will be the people making sure we reduce our CO2 emissions and work to end our dependence on foreign fossil fuels. We are supporting future leaders in Ireland’s fight against climate change.” Previous recipients have used the bursary to study at University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, NUI Galway, University College Cork, Dublin City University, and the Law Society of Ireland. Candidates can apply for the bursary until 2 March here. TechCentral Reporters Read More: renewable energy Renewables STEM students',\n",

       "  'title': 'New offices drive demand in Dublin as investors and occupiers shy away from older stock',\n",
       "  'text': 'Last year was an extraordinary year for Dublin’s office market, with take-up coming in above the long-term average, at a total of 2.64 million sq ft despite multiple disruptions and concerns, particularly in relation to global funding costs and accessibility. Demand for new space in the city centre dominated activity as occupier preference for space with the highest sustainable credentials and proximity to transport links comes to the fore. Offices located in Dublin 1 and 2 represented 70 per cent per cent of all the deals signed in 2022, with activity in the city’s north docklands particularly strong (25 per cent of total activity in 2022). While there were 37 deals signed in the final quarter, the top 10 made up 75 per cent of the total as a number of larger deals returned to the market. Deals of note in 2022 included ServiceNow’s decision to take 88,000sq ft at 60 Dawson in Dublin 2, A&L Goodbody’s decision to take 62,600sq ft at North Wall Quay, Dublin 1 and SMBC Aviation Capital’s decision to take 135,000sq ft at Fitzwilliam 28, Dublin 2. The largest deal of the year was completed in the final quarter, with Citigroup committing to a large new building in Dublin’s north docklands, which is due to complete in 2026. Prime rents ended the year at €70 per sq ft. An increase in the amount of space that has come to the “grey” market will give some occupiers more choice in 2023 and, combined with new space due to complete, is expected to result in a softening in prime rents, to €65 per sq ft by mid-year. Key factors such as a fundamentally higher funding cost environment (which is now set to remain in place), a higher cost base for construction, a dip in the office supply pipeline in 2024 and occupier preference for the best space, is expected to put a floor on rents and see a return to rental growth towards the end of 2023. While the overall Dublin market vacancy rate remains above 10 per cent as we start 2023 (and is expected to be more volatile in 2023 as grey market space is absorbed into the market), space available with Ber energy ratings of B and below will become less and less attractive to occupiers. The vacancy level that more accurately reflects the space that investors and occupiers are interested in is closer to 6 per cent. Supported by the continued performance of key sectors driving wider economic activity, Ireland remains well ahead of its euro zone counterparts, largely driven by the volume of jobs created over the 2019-2022 period, which has delivered the highest tax revenue on record. International investors researching the Dublin office market are well aware of Ireland’s strong labour market, and concerns about the impact of tech sector employment correction are being taken against this wider backdrop. Ireland is set to continue to remain of particular interest to international occupiers and investors, and while 2023 begins with a difficult global backdrop, the domestic environment is as well positioned as possible to allow for continued strong occupier activity in 2023. Professional services companies are expected to lead demand in 2023. Joan Henry is chief economist and head of research at Knight Frank Ireland',\n",

       "  'title': \"Minister Ryan launches Ireland's first all-electric town bus service in Athlone - MerrionStreet\",\n",
       "  'text': 'Athlone’s town bus service is to become Ireland’s first all-electric bus service. The service was officially launched by Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan TD in Athlone today (Friday). Operated by Ireland’s national bus company, Bus Éireann (BÉ), and funded by the Department of Transport through the National Transport Authority (NTA), physical works to transform the town bus service into a 100% electric operation began last year, with the service due to commence operations on the 29 January. The project, a €10 million investment by the NTA, is the first to launch under the Government’s Pathfinder Programme – a package of exemplar transport projects to be delivered by state agencies and local authorities around the country within the next three years. The Pathfinder Programme forms a key part of the implementation of the National Sustainable Mobility Policy, which sets out the government’s plan to meet Ireland’s requirement to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in the transport sector. This Pathfinder project, an additional investment in public transport, will see 11 new state-of-the-art electric buses operate Athlone town services. The new fleet will reduce CO2 emissions by 400,000kg annually and will deliver a quieter, cleaner bus service for the town and passengers. Over 540,000 kilometres are operated on the Athlone town bus service each year, with over 10,000 passengers now using the service weekly – a 20% increase on 2019 figures. The new buses will be charged using newly-installed charging infrastructure supplied with power from the newly-constructed electricity substation within the Bus Éireann depot on Station Road, Athlone. Construction and installation work here was carried out by ESB Smart Energy Services. In preparing for the commencement of operations, Bus Éireann drivers and mechanics have undergone a comprehensive training programme – more than 500 hours – on the driving, maintenance and operation of the new buses which will deliver emission-free public transport. Speaking at the launch, Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan said: “The launch of these new electric town buses and the electrification of the Athlone depot is important on a number of fronts. It’s important because it will give Athlone town a new, quieter, cleaner bus service. It’s important because it’s the first of our 35 Pathfinder Projects to be delivered, just months after we first launched the programme last Autumn. And it’s important because it’s a sign of exciting things to come. “Driven by our new Climate Action Plan 2023, the future of Irish transport is on the cusp of radical change for the better. And that radical change will be driven by electricity – electric buses, electric cars, electric trains, powered for the most part by our own home-grown, cheaper renewable energy in the future. “I’m also delighted that this change is starting in Athlone because the other big difference afoot is the upscaling in rural transport that is happening. In 2022, we connected 67 new towns with buses and that number will continue to climb. I would like to commend Bus Eireann and the National Transport Authority for all the work they are doing across the country, and I look forward to many more bus services and depots going electric over the coming years.” CEO of the National Transport Authority Anne Graham said:The launch of these electric buses today represents a very significant milestone on the journey to a zero-emissions fleet for our town and city bus services. “From today the people of Athlone will benefit from buses that are cleaner, quieter, more comfortable and more attractive. “Athlone will be the first service in Ireland to be delivered entirely by electric buses, and we should not underestimate the significance of that for this town and for public transport in general. “The experience we gain here with our colleagues in Bus Éireann will doubtless stand us in good stead as NTA rolls out similar programmes in Dublin and in other cities and towns in the months and years ahead.” Stephen Kent, Chief Executive Officer, Bus Éireann said: “We’re delighted to see the launch of Ireland’s first all-electric town bus service in Athlone today, demonstrating the commitment and ambition of the Government, NTA and Bus Éireann to deliver transformative sustainable public transport services across the country. “This new fleet in Athlone is a particularly welcome development for Bus Éireann as we continue on our journey to become one of the most sustainable national transport companies in Europe. The operational experience will be invaluable as we expand electric vehicles to other urban services. ”We are excited to be operating the fleet, which will deliver a more modern, sustainable and comfortable service and provide an enhanced customer experience for passengers. A smoother and quieter ride is welcome as is improved access for persons with reduced mobility. “The all-electric Athlone service will help us to make real progress towards the ambitious goals we set out in our ‘Driving Change Sustainability Strategy, 2021-2030’ to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and to have half of our urban bus fleet transition to low and zero emission vehicles by the same time.” ENDS About NTA The National Transport Authority (NTA) is a statutory non-commercial body, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Transport.

       "  'title': 'Relying on private sector to build houses a ‘vulnerability’, officials say',\n",
       "  'text': 'Reliance on the private sector to deliver housing is a “vulnerability”, particularly with 2023 delivery targets coming under pressure, the Government’s spending department has said. Concerns about the challenges in housing and other areas are contained in a briefing document prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its new minister, Paschal Donohoe who took up the role in last month’s midterm rotation in Government. The Government department pointed to problems ahead in the year, saying that the overall 2023 target of 29,000 new housing units would be “challenging” to achieve due to high construction costs, capacity constraints, rising interest rates and disruptions in the supply chain. The department said structural issues such as planning, productivity and innovation, along with high construction costs, would “continue to challenge housing supply”. [ Irish house price growth slows to 8.6% ] [ Construction slows as inflation hits sector ] There was a 14 per cent year-on-year decline in new housing units commenced in the third quarter of 2022 and, if this downward trend continues, overall completions will fall, it said. It raised doubt around whether new schemes to address vacancy – a central plank in increasing supply – would deliver the scale of supply required, given that the schemes, including the Croí Cónaithe Towns grants initiative for derelict homes, were only recently introduced. The Government’s Housing for All strategy, launched in September 2021, commits to delivering 33,000 housing units on average every year, though experts warn significantly more units will be required to address chronic supply shortages in the housing crisis. The department said there were a significant number of uncommenced apartment planning permissions, some 43,000 apartments at the end of 2021, but there were viability issues around delivering housing through build-to-rent/sell and student accommodation schemes. [ Housing crisis ‘holding us back as a country’ and ‘causing intergenerational division’ - Taoiseach ] The “complex” design of the €450 million Croí Cónaithe scheme, aimed at delivering 5,000 apartments by 2025 in otherwise unviable developments, has “meant a lower-than-anticipated interest from developers” and is “likely too small” to address the scale of viability issues. It is estimated about 6,500 new social housing units will be delivered in 2023, some 2,500 units below target. Less than 1,000 affordable units are expected to be delivered for 2022. The department said the housing assistance payment (HAP) scheme – the main scheme to house the homeless – had reached its capacity due to constraints in the private rental market. This has resulted in fewer properties being available to accommodate homeless people and the problem has been exacerbated by large numbers of private landlords leaving the market. While the department said, in the 131-page briefing document, that the temporary ban on evictions would help manage homelessness during the winter, the longer-term consequences were “likely to negatively impact the rental market and deter investment in the rental sector”. “It is critical that the rental sector is reviewed, including an examination of options to curb further exits of landlords from the market,” the department said. [ Euro zone’s construction sector in worst decline since start of pandemic ] [ First 200 modular homes for Ukrainians expected by Easter ] In the response to accommodating people fleeing the war in Ukraine, the department said the Department of Education indicated that many of the excess places in schools for Ukrainian students had been “exhausted” and that further increases would require capital investment. The Department of Education said that, as of December 22nd last, 13,753 Ukrainian pupils had been enrolled in schools, including 8,823 in primary schools and 4,930 in secondary schools. It is “anticipating significant challenges” in finding enough places for 2023, particularly at post-primary level, due to continued arrivals, the relocation of existing Ukrainian students around the country and more than 1,000 students graduating from sixth class. “The department continues to work close with the Department of Children to, where possible, match new arrivals with existing school capacity,” it said. The overall State support provided in humanitarian supports for Ukrainian refugees is expected to be about €1 billion in 2022 and between €1.6 billion and €2.2 billion in 2023.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Pure fantasy to believe our GP numbers can handle free care',\n",
       "  'text': 'Sir — The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has found that extending free GP care to everyone by 2026 can be done and would cost the State up to €881m. At that price, it sounds like a bargain — especially when you take into account the Government’s latest wheeze, to pay over €2.5bn to do remedial works on poorly built Celtic Tiger-era apartment blocks.I am acutely aware that free GP care is a key pillar of the Sláintecare health policy.However, I am bewildered as to how this will actually work in practice.At the moment, we have a population of more than five million people, but it is growing very fast. We also have about 4,000 active GPs in Ireland, but that number is reportedly going in the opposite direction.It seems to me that government proposals to extend GP care look lightweight.It has been widely reported that 25pc of GPs are over the age of 60, and this means more and more medical practices will in the future end up closing.I am left wondering whether there will be enough GPs left in this country to care for so many patients?It is my contention that the Government appears to be living in cloud cuckoo land if it believes the present and future medical workforce can actually cope with the chimera of having a free GP healthcare service.I would ask Health Minister Stephen Donnelly to explain clearly how this new free service is going to work, considering the paucity of GP practices operating currently in Ireland.Wasting time playing party political gamesSir — Ireland faces a multitude of very serious problems in areas such as (but not confined to) health, housing and homelessness. While I am apolitical, I am nevertheless perplexed and angry as to why some of our public representatives are instead focusing on a time-wasting exercise in pursuing Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe.The opposition would be better employed in trying to help solve some of the major problems facing us citizens. How much valuable Dáil time will be taken up this week just so the minister explains what can best be described as a non-event?I just wish our public representatives would for once act in a meaningful way on behalf of the electorate and stop playing their party political games.Quit throwing stones and get on with the jobSir — Certain politicians outraged at the perceived wrongdoing by Paschal Donohoe would do well to remember the biblical adage: “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.”Any possibility that some of the frenetic energy expended on stone-throwing could be redirected towards resolving the hospital crisis, asylum-seekers’ accommodation, overspend on the Children’s Hospital, children suffering hugely while waiting for essential scoliosis surgery and the energy crisis?No doubt stone-throwing is fun, but it’s unproductive. Focus on real issues for once, please.\\u200bA rather odd take from Eamon RyanSir — Last week in the Dáil, the Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said he had a “similar perspective” to the Tánaiste in regard to Paschal Donohoe.“My sense is there are questions to be answered,” he said, adding that the place where this should be done was before the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo).He went on: “I think it’s difficult sometimes to do it in the Dáil because in a sense those asking the questions may have questions asked of them in turn.’’He seems to be implying that they should all circle the wagons, keep their heads down and say nothing because they have committed the same ‘offence’’.\\u200bStorm in a teacup while Rome burnsSir — Sitting at the kitchen table after he had blown out the two candles on his birthday cake (one in the shape of a 9, the other in the shape of a 1), I asked my dad his views on the recent “six men and a van” controversy surrounding Paschal Donohoe.His responses were “honest man”, “storm in a teacup”, “scandalous waste of Dáil time with the country and the world in a state of crisis”.At 91 years of age, my dad, who has seen it all before (and who is not an avowed Fine Gaeler), just hit the nail squarely on the head.\\u200bEthics in public office not taken seriouslySir — The applause for Damien English and Paschal Donohoe at last week’s FG TDs meeting demonstrates that the ruling parties do not take ethics and misconduct in public office seriously.The constant drip of scandal is having a corrosive effect on politics. Sipo’s powers require serious revision. But can politicians be up to the task when they have skin in the game?As the political class squabbled last week over a few thousand euro, and about who is the most virtuous (none of them), the same people handed out €2.5bn because of an incompetent, deceitful and greedy building industry. It is enough to make you throw your hands up in the air with despair.\\u200bWho now gets the job to fix faulty buildings?Sir — Housing Minster Darragh O’Brien’s newly announced redress scheme for faulty apartments built during the Celtic Tiger years will cost the taxpayer an estimated €2.5bn.The builders responsible, many of whom liquidated their companies and pocketed the profits from these defective buildings, were never held to account.Will these same builders and developers — many now operating under new company names — get the job of rectifying these faulty apartments?With the Government’s housing policy in a shambles, maybe this is just a simpler way of trying to appease voters.\\u200bHousing mandarin deserves more paySir — As a citizen, I was embarrassed to read the headline in last week’s paper regarding a pay dispute for the country’s top housing civil servant (Top housing civil servant fights for pay rise to €250k).It is regrettable that when we ask such post-holders to solve our housing crisis, we cannot benchmark their salary to industry norms.In the same issue, I read reports/advertisement from the private sector construction industry. I expect the chief of such enterprises earns more that €220,000 for their lesser roles.I hope the Government better remunerates the staff charged with resolving the housing crisis.\\u200bGAA must get to grips with hand passingSir — I watched a replay of this year’s All-Ireland minor hurling final on TG4 recently — a magnificent match. The skill level from both teams was fantastic. Tipperary showed wonderful class and spirit to come back to win against all the odds.Offaly are certainly going places with that team. Their skill was extraordinary. The backs’ defending was reminiscent of the great Offaly teams of the 1980s and ’90s. The scoring, particularly from the two corner forwards, was a joy to watch. However, there was a serious issue, highlighted on your letters page by former Tipperary All-Stars Conor O’Donovan and Michael Cleary regarding the ‘throwing’ of the ball, which took from the game, particularly in the first half.The referee totally ignored this persistent fouling, so the players understandably continued.While good suggestions were put forward by Michael and by another letter writer, John Manning, to disallow hand passes altogether, I feel that would be unworkable as teams would find it easier to ‘smother’ a player, which would lead only to further rucks.Conor’s suggestion, however, to disallow the hand pass from the holding hand would be far more practical and easier to monitor by referees. The ball can be passed or moved on quickly with the hurl or the other hand.Come on, rules committee of the GAA. Get to grips with this situation immediately and make this simple adjustment to the rules to eliminate this blot from our game.\\u200bScrum caps should be essential in rugbySir — I had the pleasure last week of watching some very entertaining rugby matches. It was great to see so many talented young players coming into the game. It was also very sad to see so many players with serious or permanent ear damage.It should be compulsory to wear good scrum caps with fitted ear protection for every level of rugby, male and female. If this were to happen in a sport involving animals such as race horses, there would be uproar.So why is it acceptable for rugby players?Cannabis no quick fix to mental health issueSir — I was dismayed to read your headline last week, “Snooker, soccer and cannabis jellies: How Lynn Ruane found way to beat burnout and pulled herself back from the brink.”The headline implies that using cannabis is an effective way to treat burnout and mental health problems.I am a psychiatrist who is concerned about the mental health of young people, and I believe headlines such as this ‘normalise’ the use of cannabis and provide a poor example to our youth.There is now a great deal of scientific evidence to show cannabis use is harmful to the developing brain, and the THC component can increase the risk of psychosis and suicidality.The cannabis jellies mentioned in this piece are particularly high in THC content and are responsible for many cases of accidental poisoning in children in the US and elsewhere.I certainly agree that exercise and social connectedness are effective in tackling burnout, but substance use is not a helpful strategy.\\u200bIt’s D-Day in Dáil for abundance of TDsSir — I applaud Denis Donohue’s Letter of the Week last Sunday, with his contribution on the excessive number of TDs in Dáil Éireann. Denis showed the number of TDs was a multiple of their equivalents in other European countries.If we cast the comparison net wider, our over-representation becomes more absurd.If India was to have the same proportion of national parliamentarians to its population as we have in the Dáil, it would require 45,052 parliamentarians instead of the present 552.They say all politics are local, and this is the reason for the 160 TDs we have. Perhaps an alternative approach would be a given budget for Dáil Éireann to include the salaries and expenses of its members.It would be interesting to see how the numbers would develop if the choice was between greater numbers with reduced pay or greater pay due to reduced numbers.Turkeys arriving to ‘DWTS’ right on cueSir — There are always a few turkeys on . This year is no different.Thankfully, last Sunday I was able to switch over to the BBC to watch the concluding frames of the Masters snooker, which was excellent entertainment. Mark Williams (47) was pipped at the post by his younger opponent, Judd Trump (33).A turkey may be able to give its younger, slimmer opponent a good run for their money in the snooker, but sadly not so in a dancing competition. The public generally keep the turkeys in the competition for their own amusement and get rid of them when they are tired of laughing at them.On the other hand, the Masters turkey may yet be champion in a future competition.\\u200bRyan needs garda to be in the frameSir — Rather than having a close protection garda accompanying Green Party leader Eamon Ryan by bicycle, surely the most efficient way of cutting down emissions would be if they shared a tandem?\\u200bBig freeze shows no sign of chilling outSir — We have had some week up here in Donegal. Beautiful, freezing snow. Every day we hoped: “It will never last.”\\u200bTop level of health service is a shamblesSir — The endless shambles in the HSE is a terrible reflection on management there and in the Department of Health.I would compare the health service position to the financial crisis at the end of the Noughties. Maybe the only way to deal with the problem is to close down the entire top level of the department and the HSE and replace them with proven international experts — in the same way as the late Brian Lenihan Jr brought in financial experts to sort out the financial crisis,I’d like to see Jim O’Callaghan appointed health minister.\\u200b‘Respectable’ tag for hunting ill-deservedSir — Justice Minister Simon Harris has strongly condemned the alleged ill-treatment of horses in a sulky race on the M3.While I’m sure he has a soft spot for horses, I wish he and his colleagues would show the same compassion towards the animals that suffer in the “respectable” pursuits of fox hunting and hare coursing.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WELCOME TO HOW I Spend My Money, a series on The Journal that looks at how people in Ireland really handle their finances. We’re asking readers to keep a record of how much they earn, what they save if anything, and what they’re spending their money on over the course of one week. Are you a spender, a saver or a splurger? We’re looking for readers who will keep a money diary for a week. If you’re interested send a mail to money@thejournal.ie. We would love to hear from you. Each money diary is submitted by readers just like you. When reading and commenting, bear in mind that their situation will not be relatable for everyone, it is simply an account of a week in their shoes, so let’s be kind. I’m a single parent due to separation. I work full-time in the public health system. I live outside Dublin because I can’t afford to live in Dublin where I’m from, and I commute to work in Dublin. I have one child, a daughter, who is the apple of my eye, and most of my decisions are based around her. I also try to pursue some of my own interests and a sedate social life! I’m mostly content with my situation but I do sometimes feel the burden of one income needing to cover everything, including savings! Especially when there are large unexpected expenses, like car trouble or a problem with something in the house, etc. I’m lucky that I have a reasonably good job and I can provide for us, but I studied and worked hard and made a lot of sacrifices to get where I am. I’d be interested to see if readers had any constructive advice for me. Occupation: Health and social care professional – half as a clinician and half as a team manager Age: 38 Location: The east of the country Salary: €63,000 Monthly pay (net): €3,555 Children’s allowance: €140 – saved each month Maintenance from my child’s father: €500, but he also pays for her activities, summer holidays and is generous at birthday and Christmas Total monthly income combined (net): €4,195 Monthly expenses Transport: €130 petrol €20 for parking in work Mortgage: €1100 Childcare: €455 approx (depends a bit on my working hours, etc) Household bills: Tv/phone/broadband – €99, gas/electricity – €110, bins – €15 approx Life insurance: €20 Income protection: €140 – this is very expensive insurance to have but I feel as a single parent I really need it Car insurance: €40 House insurance: €28 Cleaner: €130 per month or €32 per week Health insurance: €1,450 per year for me and €350 for my daughter. I pay it in full, but daughter’s father contributes half of hers, so cost to me is €120 per month although I don’t pay it like that Groceries: €500 Subscriptions: Netflix – €9, Disney + – €9, Google photos – €1.99 Charity: Oxfam – €15, Focus Ireland – €15 Savings: €400 towards car fund for when I need to change it, and separate €140 for my daughter. This is the children’s allowance saved every month for her future *** Monday 6.00 am: Alarm goes off. Up and prepare my daughter’s school lunch and my own lunch for work later. I try to eat healthily and save time and money at work by not going to the canteen. Unload the dishwasher, and hang out the washing that has been done overnight. 6.45 am: I do an online yoga class for an hour (€15). I wake my daughter before jumping in for a quick shower and get dressed for work. 8.00 am: Breakfast for both of us. Help my daughter get dressed and out the door for 8.30 am. I drop her to school at 8.45 (thank God it’s local!) and by 8.50 am I’m on the road to work. 9.30 am: Arrive at work. It’s always busy after the weekend! First thing I do is scan emails, then meet the team, see how everyone is fixed, any issues arising etc. The team I work with are great. We mostly get on with our own work but help each other out as needed. As a senior team member, as complications arise I’m pulled in to try to help them out which I’m glad to do. I spend the morning catching up on emails, planning and confirming arrangements for the week ahead. Healthcare is so dynamic, there can be rapidly changing schedules. 11.00 am: I grab a coffee in our staff room at no cost to me and eat a banana I brought from home. More emails, calls and meeting prep take me to lunchtime. Lunch is short, 20 mins whilst I eat my homemade soup and toasted sandwich I prepared this morning, and a quick social catch up with the team. 12.00 pm: The afternoon is busy with clinic appointments, which take the whole afternoon. There’s no time for an afternoon break. 5.00 pm: My brain is tired so I grab a quick coffee and eat three Cadbury roses from the staff room. Bad habit really shortly before dinner, but I feel like I need an energy boost. I tend to further emails/final calls of the day. 5.45 pm: I finish up. Thankfully the worst of the traffic is gone so I get home quickly, stopping at the childminder to pick up my daughter at 6.20 pm. 6.30 pm: Home and I reheat dinner for both of us. Leftover chicken and broccoli bake I made at the weekend. Tidy up after dinner, check daughter’s homework (which is not much thankfully) to ensure it’s done properly, check her lunchbox to make sure lunch is eaten (it is!) 7.15 pm: I spend a while playing with my daughter before getting her ready for bed. Phone my sister for a chat afterwards. We make plans to try to meet up at the weekend. 8.00 pm: I watch a bit of telly whilst simultaneously scrolling through my phone, and messaging some friends. 10.30 pm: I’m tired so head to bed and listen to a podcast. Today’s total: €15.00 Tuesday 6.30 am: Time to get up. No yoga this morning, so I shower, get dressed, etc and prepare lunches for both of us. 7.00 am: I prepare dinner by putting it in the slow cooker on low. It’ll be on for 9-10 hours whilst I’m out at work. Fold and put away clothes that were drying overnight. I try to minimise what needs ironing because I pay someone to do it – this might sound like a luxury to others, but I just don’t have time to do everything myself! 7.45 am: Wake my daughter to get her ready for school. Thankfully she’s pretty good at getting up and getting ready in the morning. My daughter needs €14 for books she selected from the recent book fair at school. I also Revolut a colleague €10 (we are sending flowers to another colleague who had a baby recently). 8.30 am: Drop my daughter to school. Traffic is heavy this morning, so I’m going to be late for work! 9.30 am: I’m late for a meeting that I have started by phone from the car (thank God for Bluetooth and virtual meeting options). This is not how I like to start the day! 9.45 am: I get to work and join the meeting in person. 11.00 am: Finish the meeting and go grab a coffee in the staff room with the team. Catch up on their issues and try troubleshooting with them. 11.30 am: Finally get to my office and work on a project that’s on a tight deadline. 1.30 pm: Where did the last two hours go? I go to the staff room to get my lunch of smoked salmon and avocado on a toasted bagel, followed by a yoghurt. This was all bought during the weekly shop. Have a team meeting this afternoon, so I get takeout teas and coffees for the team. I do this the odd time, they all work so hard. Cost is €21.75! 3.00 pm: After our meeting, I spend the rest of the afternoon returning calls and emails that have piled up, and working on some of my projects. There’s a lot going on in healthcare at the moment with endless asks for inputs on different things. 5.00 pm: Leave work and collect my daughter from the childminder on the way home. We also stop to buy bread (€1.80) for school lunches for the remainder of the week. 6.00 pm: Get home. Herself is delighted with books from the book club and can’t wait to show me! I get the smell of bolognese in the slow cooker as soon as we enter the kitchen – yum. Quickly cook some spaghetti with extra for lunch tomorrow and check her homework and lunchbox – all ok. 6.30 pm: Eat dinner and tidy up afterwards. 7.00 pm: Watch some kids’ TV with my daughter. It’s mind-numbing, but she loves it when I watch this stuff with her. I simultaneously go online to do weekly grocery shopping for delivery on Friday (€111.24). It might sound a lot for such a small household but I do some batch cooking to stock up the freezer, etc and also all cosmetics, cleaning products and the like are included. 7.45 pm: After TV, we begin one of the new books at bedtime. That’s an incentive to get up to bed early! She is asleep by 8.30 pm this eve. 9.00 pm: I decide to have a bath to relax. 9.30 pm: Watch some Netflix. 10.30 pm: Head to bed and lights out for 11 pm. Today’s total: €158.79 Wednesday 6.00 am: I get up and do my online yoga class (€15). 7.00 am: Get my daughter up, shower and dress, etc. My daughter does an art class directly after school today and another mother of a child in her class collects her and brings her back to their house for a play. This is a huge help to me as it eliminates a day’s childcare for me. Although her childminder is excellent and very flexible, the cost really adds up. Little things like that make a big difference to me. I will try to get out of work a bit early today not to take advantage of the other parent’s generosity, and at Christmas I’ll gift them some wine or chocolates. 9.30 am: Drop herself to school and at work for 9.30 am. Full-on day of meetings and working on various projects, consulting with the team, etc. 1.00 pm: I heat up my spag bol and eat at my desk and work through lunch as I’ll leave about 4 pm today. 1.30 pm: After lunch, I treat myself to a cappuccino (€3.75). I also buy a birthday card and stamp to send to a friend (€4.55). It’s also my father’s birthday soon, so I order some aftershave for him (€120). My sister will probably go halves with me but I haven’t checked, and we’ll take him out for lunch on the day. I make an appointment to see my GP as I require a routine blood test for some medication I’m on. 4.45 pm: Something came up and I don’t get out of work as early as I’d hoped I would. Traffic is bad and I stop for petrol on the way (€62.47). 5.30 pm: I finally collect my daughter from her friend’s house and we get home soon after. She has been fed chicken dippers and chips. She didn’t get to finish her art work in art class and is keen to finish this now. She asks me to do some artwork too. I join in because I know how much she loves it when I do things with her, and I have the constant guilt of not having enough time with her. 7.00 pm: I make an omelette for myself and some French toast for her. I give her a bath before bed, which she also loves, and I feel like we’ve had some quality time together this evening. 8.30 pm: She’s in bed and ready to fall asleep. I phone a friend who has been asking my advice about job applications, etc. She is looking to change sectors. This call takes over an hour. It’s good to chat and to try to offer some advice to others. She says we should meet up soon for dinner and drinks which I’d like. We’re both busy working mums, it might take some weeks to get this arranged! 10:00 pm: I watch some Netflix, drink tea and eat chocolate before going to bed too late at 11.30 pm. Today’s total: €205.77 Thursday 6.00 am: I’m up and prepping for the day ahead. I’m attending a conference today and have to travel to it, so I need to be away early. 7.00 am: I wake my daughter, get her dressed and drop her to the childminder half an hour later, where she’ll have breakfast and watch TV before going to school. I’m on the train by 8 am. 9.00 am: I get to the conference for welcome tea and coffee. The conference is great but exhausting, very full on, but meet lots of interesting people. All tea, coffee and lunch included and work will pay for my parking and train ticket there. 4.30 pm: It’s been a long day. There’s a wine reception after the conference which I’d love to stay for, but can’t and actually need to leave a little early as I’ve to get home. It’s a very long day for my daughter being with the childminder both before and after school. 5.00 pm: I tend to a few work emails on the train journey home. Collect daughter at 6.15 pm who has had dinner I sent to childminder – leftover spaghetti bol. I will need to pay the childminder a bit extra this week for the longer hours. I’m very lucky she is so flexible. 6.30 pm: We arrive home. The cleaner has come today (she has a key) and I just remotely turn off the alarm and reset when she’s done. I Revolut her €32 for two hours’ work. She is a godsend, the house is sparkling! 7.00 pm: Play with my daughter for a bit, then put her to bed by 8 pm. 8.30 pm: I make myself a toasted sambo with crisps and tea as a snack (I had big lunch at the conference) and eat that whilst watching some Netflix. 10.00 pm: Tired after a long day, so I head up to bed. Today’s total: €32.00 Friday 7.00 am: I get up, prep lunches for my daughter and me, get my daughter up, etc. 8.30 am: I head to my GP appointment, the first appointment of the day. Thankfully it runs on time as I have my daughter with me and need to get her into school! Just bloods and repeat prescription so only €30 at GP, but I know the prescription will cost me €56. 8.50 am: Get my daughter to school just in the nick of time and I’m on the road to work. 9.30 am: Have a clinic this morning but shouldn’t be too busy. Intermittently popping to the office to follow up on other tasks too and grab a quick coffee and scone (brought with me) to keep me going. I take half day annual leave today – I do this occasionally to facilitate a play date. My daughter gets invited to way more than I can return due to working full time, but I think other parents are generally understanding of this. 1.30 pm: I leave work on time to collect my daughter and two friends from school. 3.00 pm: Get home with the three kids and they immediately go up to her room to play. I love having kids in the house, and to be honest, they’re all good kids although I’m supervising, because they’re happily occupied, I tend to get some of my own things done around the house. Tesco online delivery arrives and I put it away. I also make a big batch of soup that I will use for some work lunches during the week and I’ll freeze some, while the girls are ‘doing art’ at the kitchen table. 4.30 pm: I put pizza on for them, and me. They have theirs in a den they built with couch cushions, blankets etc. House is messy but I know this is a good play for them and won’t last forever! 6.30 pm: Their parents pick them up as my daughter has swim lesson this eve. It’s not great timing, but she’s one of those kids who was affected by the Covid delay in getting to start swimming lessons and there is a huge demand for a place in lessons for her age so I had to just take what I could get. It’s paid for by term (€140) so no cost today, and her father usually pays for this and other after-school activities. 8.00 pm: Home from swimming and dry daughter’s hair and get her ready for bed, do a few stories, etc. It’s been a long day. 8.30 pm: I’m really tired myself. I phone my sister and my father and we make plans to meet on Sunday. 9.00 pm: I go to bed early and read. Today’s total: €86.00 Saturday 9.15 am: Bit of a lie on this morning. I have a leisurely breakfast of pancakes and smoothies. 11.00 am: I bring my daughter to a ballet lesson paid for by her father. I sometimes go for a walk while this is on but today I just sit in the car and catch up on some life admin. 12.00 pm: After ballet, I meet a friend and her two kids in a cafe for a quick hot chocolate for the kids, and cappuccinos for mummies. We each pay our own way – €7.90 for me. We go to a local playground for a while but it’s really cold so we don’t stay too long. 1.30 pm: I head home with my daughter and we have a late lunch of sausage sandwiches! Just some downtime then till her father comes to collect her at 3 pm. He will take her overnight until around 2.30 pm tomorrow. He works abroad a lot so we don’t have a regular schedule of when he sees her, it depends on his work etc. She is due to attend a birthday party from 12-2 pm tomorrow in a play centre. He will bring her but I send her off with the birthday present wrapped (€15) and card (€1), as I wouldn’t rely on him to organise this. 3.15 pm: After my daughter leaves, I actually go to bed and set my alarm for an hour’s time – I’m that tired from the week, I feel I need it as girls’ night out planned this eve. 4.30 pm: Get up, shower and get ready to go out tonight. I always try to utilise time like tonight to have a social life, so I’ve arranged to meet my group of friends I trained in college with. There are six girls in total who maintained a friendship for years. 6.00 pm: I drive over to my friend’s house because I’ll stay with her tonight. I stop on the way to pick up a bottle of wine (€12.50) so I don’t arrive empty handed. We have a glass of wine that was meant as a gift to my friend, and then her husband drops us into town. 8.00 pm: We meet the others for cocktails before dinner. Two cocktails (€30). We go for dinner after (€70 each with drinks and tip). We debate going for another drink after, but really we’ve had enough and get a taxi home. My friend insists on paying. I must remember to get her back another time. 12.30 am: Flop into bed for sleep with no alarm clock, bliss! Today’s total: €136.40 Sunday 9.00 am: It’s bliss not having to get up when I wake up! I doze on and off till 10.30 am when I can hear my friend and her husband up. I get up and have breakfast with them. 11.00 am: Quick shower and head home. I don’t hang around as I’ve things to do and don’t want to impinge on their plans for the day. 12.00 pm: I get home and tidy up my house a bit – unload the dishwasher, put on washing, etc. I start to prepare for dinner. My father and sister will come over later this afternoon for dinner for my father’s birthday, which is actually tomorrow but we won’t get to celebrate then. I remember I have no birthday cake for him. I think about chancing some baking with herself when she gets home, which she loves to do, but then I think that I’ll be too pushed for time to do that. 1.00 pm: I nip out to a local shop to buy a cake (€6.95) and a card (€3.45). 1.30 pm: I head home, wrap the aftershave bought earlier in the week. My sister has Revoluted me €60 for the aftershave and will bring a bottle of wine with her, although no one will drink much, maybe a small glass each. If I hadn’t drunk so much last night I might have had an extra glass when I’m sitting down tonight after my daughter is in bed, but I know I won’t feel like it, as last night was enough alcohol for me. 2.40 pm: My daughter is dropped home with a party bag and full of sugar of course. She’s in good form after the party. She forgot granddaddy and her auntie were coming over. She sets about making a birthday card for him and wants to have a present herself for him. I didn’t anticipate this. I give her a large bar of chocolate already bought as part of weekly shop, and this suffices for her. We chat while I prepare dinner and she makes birthday card for grandad. 4.00 pm: Our guests arrive and we have dinner around an hour later. It’s great to have family round, it livens the place up a bit and they fuss over my daughter and she’s delighted to see them. We do cake after dinner and my daughter has to have a go blowing out the candles too. We just chat and catch up and mark the passing of another year. My mother died a few years ago so we’re all aware that life is to be celebrated. 7.15 pm: My father and sister leave and I go bathe my daughter and get her ready for bed. She’s in bed by 8.30 pm, clothes and uniform ready for the morning. 9.00 pm: I watch a bit of Netflix, send some messages and do too much scrolling before deciding to head to bed for 11 pm. Today’s total: € 10.40 Weekly subtotal: €644.36 – €60 back from my sister €584.36, but approx €200 of this (petrol, cleaner, groceries) is accounted for in my monthly budget *** What I learned - Some days my expenditure is surprisingly high. This week there was a birthday present for my father and a GP visit, but in reality, there’s something additional every week! I was so glad all went ok with my daughter’s father re Saturday night. If I had to pay a babysitter €10 per hour, it almost makes a night out prohibitively expensive, or I may have cancelled. I feel like I spend a lot on various ‘insurance’ but I consider them all necessary in my circumstances, and I have shopped around for better deals but I reckon I’m on a decent price for the cover I have. I really hate wasting food with so much food poverty and I make a conscious effort to ensure very little if any food goes in the bin in my house. I try to get the balance between spending and saving and also distinguish from essential expenditure and luxury expenditure with a night out, there was some of that here but it is needed at times. I would love to work part-time but I really can’t afford to. There always seems to be something else to pay for. That said, I think it’s good for my daughter to see her mother working and feel I’m a role model for that for her. I had the opportunity for a good education and it’s being put to use and I’m able to support myself thankfully. I’d love to be able to save a bit more and have more disposable income for holidays and clothes, etc, but overall I feel I’m managing ok. I also sometimes think about investing money rather than just saving, but I really can’t afford to lose it, and I’m clueless about this issue. I’ll be interested to see if readers have any helpful tips for me, especially anyone in a similar situation.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Expect more of the same, only with more urgency in the final stretch of this Dáil term, according to the Dublin Bay South TD and long-time leader of the Green Party. “We are in a very good place in terms of doing a lot of the work in the last two years to set things up,” he says. “We have a very good climate law which we introduced a year and a half ago. Last summer, we set up sectoral targets of specific ambition in energy and transport and agriculture, and so on. And then, only a month ago, it became really more detailed, a real plan in terms of how we have to deliver it. “So for me, it’s all about delivery. Firstly we don’t have any choice. Failure is not an option because of the nature of this Irish law but also the reality of European law and European policies that are perhaps even more ambitious, in terms of scale and speed, and need for change. “Also, I would argue this is going to be good for the country. It’s not a hardship, it’s a positive development, and solutions on the climate side will be good for us. “It will be good for security, it will be good for creating employment, it’s good for Irish agriculture.” Mr Ryan concedes the level of change needed will be difficult. Change is never easy, especially the scale of this change. I think in the next two years, it’s all about delivery — housing and health reform as well as climate “They are connected because what we do in housing can and will be good for climate if we got it right. Absolutely.” Retrofitting One such challenge that brings together climate targets, housing, and health into one strand is that of retrofitting homes. There has been criticism of the slow progress so far, despite lofty ambitions and targets up to the end of the decade. The Government announced a national retrofitting scheme last February at a cost of €8bn, which aims to upgrade 75,000 homes every year from 2026 to 2030, with an overall target of 500,000. According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) at the end of October, more than 36,000 applications were received by it across its schemes, and all are experiencing significant levels of demand from homeowners. This equates to approximately 28,800 homes being retrofitted, the SEAI said. Homeowners typically have a period of eight months to complete works once approved, and there are constraints on delivery at the present time, it added. There are different schemes, which has led to confusion among homeowners and political figures alike as to the application process, while fewer than two dozen firms are actually hired or in the process of being hired to carry out the works — an enormous workload for such a small pool. Mr Ryan defended the pace of the national retrofitting programme, saying it has been only running for less than a year. “It’s starting to deliver. We did deliver on what our targets were. We delivered last year around 27,000 upgrades. Minister for Higher Education, Simon Harris, was telling me that we are seeing a huge increase in training and apprenticeships, about 2,000 have applied. You talk to people in the industry — they’re flat out, they’ve never been busier. The great thing about the national retrofitting programme we introduced last February is that they know the money is there for the next 10 years. They [firms] can invest, they can hire, they can go out and promote confidence that the funding will be there and that the political commitment is there. He defended the low number of ‘one-stop shops’ assigned by the SEAI to carry out the retrofitting programme. Mr Ryan said: “They are ramping up, and they’re not small firms — this is the likes of ESB and Scottish and Southern (SSE) — they’re not companies without scaling up capabilities. It does take time. “Last year was only the start, it was always a warming up. We have delivered roughly the scale and speed that we expected. We will go this year to 37,000 houses being upgraded, and up again the year after that. It’s delivering, the way I see it.” Infrastructure The glacial pace of planning of key infrastructure around the country is frustrating, the Environment and Transport Minister acknowledged. Housing and transport are the casualties, despite being huge social issues, he added. “We’re not moving fast enough, that is clear. I’ll give you an example. If you look at any assessment, it’s taken us roughly 10 years on the current system to deliver a bus corridor. It’s probably taking about 20 years to deliver a railway line, and similar in housing. It’s our biggest problem. “We have a lot of projects now that have had planning permission but they’re not being built. So we need speed in so many different areas and quicker changes. Sustainable transport “One of the things we’re doing is sustainable mobility in the transport side. We set up a task force to look at how we can accelerate everything. We’re focusing very much on the next three years. “I’ve rang every county council manager around the country, all 42 councils. I said to the managers, ‘can you give me examples of projects we could deliver in the next three years?’ I said we’ll fund them and we’ll make sure that it gets real attention to try and get through planning, to try and get all the support the State can give to make it happen.” It led to around 70 applications, he said. “We have picked 35 on a scientific basis in terms of the ones we think are most demonstrative projects and so on. And it’s all about how do we deliver the next three years. So for example, in Limerick, putting a train station in Moyross because there we’ve got huge areas of State land where we could put in new housing if we had a good public transport system. So build it. “In Waterford, move the railway line and station and suspension bridge — and these things are happening now — so that you develop the north quays, the Ferrybank side. “That is a housing as well as a transport development project. “In Galway city, to deliver the cross-city bus route that would start to address the chronic transport problems that they have, everyone living on one side of the city and working on the other side and having a real difficulty kind of making the city function. They’re just some of the examples.” If some local authorities can’t deliver, the department will move on to one that will, he warned. “If councils feel they can’t do it and they won’t do it — because these are difficult, a lot of decisions such as Galway are going to be difficult because it means taking road space and giving priority to buses and cycling and walking, and that can be controversial — we will say ‘OK, fine, we’ll take that project out and we’ll provide that funding to another council to do something else instead’. “We need to incentivise councils to act fast because the truth is that for a variety of complex reasons, including our planning system, complication in that and so on, it takes too long. “By taking such length of time, it’s costing the public a lot more, not only in terms of increased cost of construction, but also the loss in having better transport infrastructure better local community, better housing, more housing.” Forestry The minister has acknowledged the anger over plans by State-owned commercial forestry body Coillte to sell thousands of acres of rural Ireland to British investment fund Gresham House as part of an afforestation deal. “I do understand the disquiet. I think we have to really focus on how we get forestry right, not only in the number of hectares that we grow, but the type of forestry for better biodiversity as well as storage of carbon. “One of the real constraints here is around a decision by the European Commission back in 2003, which said that Coillte couldn’t avail of the grants and premiums that apply in afforestation. And it’s very hard without those grants and premiums because there’s significant upfront costs, and you’re competing with others who will be able to access those premiums.” Mr Ryan said he will consult with Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Pippa Hackett, on the European Commission implications. “I know she probably will agree with me on this, we should go further and I know her department and Coillte have already started questioning with the European Commission whether there a variation on that state aid rule, which would allow us invest in our land, Coillte to invest in a forestation in a way that doesn’t fall afoul of the European legislation. “That would transform what’s possible.” There is also a need to look at other funding mechanisms including State funding to develop forestry which is closer to nature, with much more emphasis on biodiversity rather than timber production, he said. “That’s happening, and Coillte has committed 50% of their afforestation and developments to be in that type of forestry. And that’s the one that I think we really need to focus on and deliver and develop at scale.” Such plans have started, albeit on a small scale, he said. “Scaling that up, I think is one of the things that where, with environmental movements and others, there is real agreement.” The forestry programme agreed by Government in November and the €1.3bn behind it is also vital, he said. “It is all directed at getting farmers to plant land and to promote agroforestry and the use of riparian forestry strips within farms that have real benefits in improving the local environment, providing the farm with a steady supply of timber for its own needs, and also really restoring biodiversity as well as storing carbon.” Agricultural emissions Mr Ryan and his party have come under sustained fire from sectors of agriculture since entering Government, with some perceiving the Greens to be stifling traditional farming. The Green Party is an ally of farmers, Mr Ryan insisted. “My sense is that there’s real change happening in Irish farming. Since the Greens have been in government, there has been a threefold increase in the amount of organic farming and its only going further up, particularly with the high price of fertiliser in the last few years. “There is huge interest in farming and, similarly, if you look at the number of farmers who have applied for this new environmental scheme, the Acres Scheme, it is way above anything previously. So I think the narrative of farmers versus the environment is wrong. The reality, what’s happened on the ground is farmers are realising this is the future. “This is where the income is. This can use their skills in a way that’s really beneficial and productive. And it’s happening — we’re seeing the numbers climbing from environmental schemes and agriculture, organic schemes, that we’ve never seen before. I think we’ll see the same in forestry, particularly with the much higher premiums that are applying for those sorts of environmentally sensitive farming systems. I expect them to take off.” Public support Mr Ryan said he believes the Irish people “want to play their part” and “won’t turn their back” on so-called climate refugees. Integration Minister Roderic O'Gorman said earlier this month that the asylum system will have to be expanded to include a new category for people fleeing the effects of climate change — comments which former justice minister Charlie Flanagan criticised as “making policy on the hoof”. In relation to climate refugees, Mr Ryan said: “I think the Irish people have a real sense of understanding and a sense of care for what is happening in the world — for playing our role, small as we are. We can’t solve all the world’s problems, we’re not responsible for doing so, but I think by and large that the Irish people want to play their part proportionately and fairly.” He rebuffed Mr Flanagan’s comment. “The chair of the Oireachtas foreign affairs committee [Mr Flanagan] may have misunderstood what was said, and certainly I don’t think it is correct what he said about “policy on the hoof” in how we manage climate refugees. “What Roderic said is clearly and absolutely correct. This is something that must be considered at an international level, particularly Europe. We don’t decide this on our own, it is decided as part of international agreements, and rightly so.” Ireland “has to manage it”, Mr Ryan said, adding that he was personally affected listening to Pakistan’s environment minister speaking about last year’s devastating floods, described as the most damaging in its history. “The truth is that we are already starting to see, for example, in Pakistan last year — up to 30m affected. I met the Pakistani minister at Cop27 in Egypt, and it was heartfelt and heartrending when you heard the scale of destruction that occurred. “Climate change is everywhere. You can’t ignore it and you can’t stop it. We will manage it as part of an international effort. We’re not like Atlas carrying the world on our shoulder but I think Irish people want to play their part, and want to be part of a world where we start to care for the environment and to care for the planet. Where those consequences are inevitable, we won’t turn our back.”\",\n",

       "  'text': 'When Weston Clendinning moved from Co Armagh to London in the hope of furthering his music career, he hadn’t expected it to take several months to find somewhere to live. The 26-year-old singer and guitarist moved over with a friend in September 2021, with his car, not realising it would in fact become their home for at least a month. “We basically ate at Wetherspoons every day,” he laughs. Clendinning had already spent months looking for places online but thought he hadn’t been successful in finding somewhere due to not being available for viewings. “We viewed endless amounts of houses and we ended up offering places six months in advance and they were still turning us down,” he says. “We eventually found a one-bed flat in Fulham, where we had to pay six months upfront, I slept on the kitchen floor, and my friend slept in the bedroom.” Clendinning isn’t the only Irish expat who has found themselves in this situation. Private rents in the United Kingdom are growing at the fastest annual rate since 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). London has been hit the hardest, with the median monthly rent in the capital now nearly twice that of the rest of England. According to property site Rightmove, the average advertised rent in London is now £2,343 (€2,674) a month. According to flat sharing website Spareroom there are now seven renters for every room available in London. Rising rents coupled with people returning to the city following the pandemic has fuelled London’s housing crisis. “It took my girlfriend about five or six months for her and her sister to get somewhere and she was on the verge of having to quit her job and move back because she couldn’t get accommodation,” Clendinning says. “The prices were through the roof. You had two girls that both had normal jobs making £30,000 a year salary [and] weren’t making the threshold to find anywhere semi-liveable. “They had to ask for help to get six months rent upfront before they eventually found somewhere where they’re now having to pay £2,500 a month for a normal enough house.” Cost-of-living crisis Finding accommodation isn’t the only issue in the city, the cost-of-living crisis has also made life in London less accessible for many Irish expats. Emma McManus (28) from Leixlip, Co Kildare, says she is unable to save at all at the moment and is terrified to put the heating on. “You’re more hyperalert, I guess,” she says. “I’m also not able to fly home as much as I used to. The flights aren’t as cheap as they used to be, you’re looking at an extra £100 in a month if you’re wanting to fly home.” McManus, who works for an ending violence against women and girls charity, says her sector is poorly paid but they are not in it for the money. That said, she has seen many colleagues with families struggling. “We’re supporting our clients who are financially abused, in hardship and poverty, we’re getting them foodbank vouchers and things like that but then we’re having to do the same ourselves. Some of my colleagues are having to go to foodbanks as well, especially those who have kids.” However, although the price of living in London is a concern, McManus said the city is full of opportunity. “The cost-of-living crisis is showing how low paid people are and how we actually need to stand up in solidarity. There’s a bit of social change happening with it too which I think will be positive long term.” Living from pay cheque to pay cheque Kate Gunnar (29), from Co Kilkenny, says she moved to Tooting in June 2021 for a change of scenery but was shocked by how expensive it is to live there. “I was a primary school teacher and taught in Dublin for three years but I wanted something different,” she says. When she first moved to the capital she did some supply teaching and office administration before landing a HR role at an Irish construction company. “I signed my contract on a really low salary of £28,000 thinking it would be okay. It was fine for the first few months but then in April things started to go up, like our electricity bill. “I wasn’t even spending money on socialising, it was just getting the Tube into work and that was costing me around £250 a month. I was continuously going into my overdraft and I had even saved up a bit from teaching. I was considering moving back to Ireland as things weren’t feasible.” Gunnar eventually changed jobs and is now working for a law firm for a better salary. “Going up in salary has helped so much, I feel I can breathe again,” she says. “I never want to be in that situation again going from pay cheque to pay cheque. The opportunities are keeping me here and the social life in London, however, I’m not sure how much longer I will stay here. If someone was moving over now I would tell them they would need to be on a good graduate salary.” ‘London has more to offer than Dublin’ Mark Byrne (29), a charity worker from Dublin moved to Croydon in March 2022, after stints working in Calais and the Balkans. “I was living in Dublin till 2019, then I chose to leave to go volunteering as I was finding it too difficult to live there with the rental crisis,” he says. “I thought I would try to go travelling and find my feet somewhere else and then the pandemic hit. After Calais, my girlfriend and I both moved to London.” Byrne now works for Refugee Support in London and questions his move but says the city brings a lot more opportunities for his line of work. “I do question my move to London because I left Dublin as it was so expensive and I couldn’t find somewhere to live properly. Now I’ve ended up going to London which is equally expensive and it’s still hard to find places to live. “I feel I’ve made a bit of a lateral move. In London, in this line of work that I do, there’s definitely a lot more available over here than in Ireland. With this sector of work, salaries are a bit lower so there is also the financial struggle that goes with getting to work in what you like but being in a very expensive city. London has more to offer than Dublin in terms of things to do, [but] I still prefer Dublin culture.” Meanwhile, Clendinning is adamant that there is no place like London for new opportunities as a musician. “I love London from a music perspective, there are so many people there trying to be the best they can be musically. It seems to attract a lot of passionate people.” Since his move, he recorded at Eastcote Studios in Kensal Town with a producer who has worked with the Coronas and Razorlight. “At Eastcote studios it’s wonderful to be immersed in that kind of environment, to be surrounded by people with the same dreams. Not only that but people who have lived their dreams. I’m still very much a dreamer.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'The world of work has undergone significant changes in recent years. The pandemic-induced move to remote working has spurred a worldwide shift in how we view and do our jobs , with many companies now allowing home working on a full-time or part-time basis forever more. In addition, advancing technologies means the needs of the labour force are constantly changing and evolving. While twenty years ago many young people were able to gain employment without a university degree, things have changed completely, with some jobs now requiring at least a Master’s Degree. While these changes might seem frightening, they can create new and exciting opportunities for students and graduates who see these trends in advance and upskill in these areas. Leo Clancy, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, said there is significant demand for employees trained in sustainability, climate and agritech in the State, as the country — and the world — seeks to become more proactive in terms of climate action. Digital technologies continue to be strong performers in the workforce too, he said, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, data science and robotic engineering. Mr Clancy said the “biggest underlying challenge” for businesses is meeting the labour and skills needs. While that creates a challenge for the companies themselves, “therein lies our opportunity” for those preparing to enter the workforce, he said . Maureen Lynch, operations director at Hays Ireland recruitment agency, said current indications suggest that all specialist areas will be recruiting in the coming years, such as technology, finance, banking, construction, engineering and life sciences. “However, the requirements will evolve as will the technical elements of these specialist areas. Never has it been truer that we are now living in a world of lifelong-learning,” she said. As a result, the key to carving out a successful career in this evolving landscape is to try to understand the needs of a marketplace and align training to meet those needs. But how is one to do that? We’ve compiled some ideas of resources that would help a student who is trying to ascertain what jobs will be available around the time of their graduation. Media Reading widely has many benefits, but especially when it comes to determining upcoming changes in the workplace. Often specialised journalists pick up on emerging trends earlier than an average person, with many publications having specific sections on the economy, jobs market and issues arising for businesses. The trick with getting the most out of media is to read across many different publications, both national and international. Harvard Business Review is a good online resource, while the likes of The Guardian, The New York Times and The Irish Times often report on the workplace and labour market trends. There are also some specialist publications that can provide niche information. For example, Made in Ireland is a bi-monthly magazine on technological innovation, news and the latest developments in the engineering and manufacturing sectors. It would be an invaluable resource for those seeking to build a long-term career in the area. Jobs listings Most jobs are now advertised online, making it easier than ever to see what work is on offer. There are so many websites specifically for advertising employment opportunities, such as Indeed.com, jobs.ie or monster.ie. If you keep an eye on the postings, you might notice emerging trends. For example, a quick look on one of the websites shows a number of advertisements for engineers and senior management roles. OECD The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website features an iLibrary on its website that provides invaluable insight on employment figures and labour market changes across a wide variety of regions, from Europe to Australia or Canada. Particularly beneficial if a student is considering pursuing work abroad after graduation, it provides research, ebooks, articles and publications offering insights to gauge global demand for certain skills or occupations. The Central Statistics Office The CSO publishes quarterly labour force surveys that feature comprehensive detail on the world of work in Ireland. While documenting the numbers in employment and unemployment, it also analyses which sectors have an increasing number of employees in active work, and which have decreasing levels of productivity. According to the most recent publication, from quarter three in 2022, employment growth was particularly strong in sectors such as construction, accommodation, and food and education. In terms of more specific occupations, there was an increase in those employed in professional occupations, skilled trades— such as chefs or construction workers — and personal services such as care workers. Pay Money is obviously a big influencing factor when deciding what job to take and what field to go into. If youare interested in figuring out just how much you could earn in a job after graduation, the website payscale.com could be of assistance. The website enables users to research and compare average salaries for various roles and get a snapshot of current market wages in Ireland through online tools and software. Recruitment Agencies Those who are consistently asked to fill roles know exactly what employers are looking for. Ireland has a myriad of recruitment agencies, many of whom send out insights via email or social media. It is worth either subscribing to those updates, following their online accounts or t contacting the agencies directly to see what information they might be able to provide to you about the jobs landscape. Ms Lynch said that, for example, Hays Ireland has a blog on its website that is regularly updated with “the latest information about emerging prospects in the world of work”. Networking Meeting people and talking to them is almost always the best way to learn new things. Schools tend to invite speakers in for sixth years, so they can hear more about universities or places of work. In university, there are often conferences organised. Students should attend these and try to speak with the guest speakers after. Ms Lynch said graduates and students should talk to as many people as possible within their preferred field. “This will give you a greater understanding of the reality of a role, the career prospects, challenges and opportunities in a given career. Critically, it will also help you grow your professional network, something that will always stand to you later on in your career,” she said. “The good news is that most people are happy to help and make themselves available for a coffee or a Zoom call.” Social media Social media dominates almost all other aspects of our lives, so it’s really no wonder that it can play a role in the workplace too. LinkedIn is probably the most obvious platform that ties into work. Request to connect with people working in industries in which you might like to pursue a career, see what they post and if they highlight any issues or opportunities. This interconnectivity shows the need to ensure that a student’s LinkedIn profile is up-to-date, professional and accurate, Ms Lynch added. Solas The State agency responsible for overseeing the further education and training sector in Ireland, Solas often works with the National Skills Council. The council regularly puts out skills bulletins, which are easily accessible online. The bulletins give a labour market overview, employment permits, vacancies and profiles of various occupational employment profiles.',\n",

       "  'text': 'With unemployment levels at record lows, there are lots of reasons for students transitioning from second to third-level education to feel confident about their career prospects when they finally take that leap into the jobs market. Notwithstanding the many issues facing young people nowadays – not least the seemingly impossible prospect of someday owning a home – getting on the job ladder has scarcely ever seemed more manageable. But what can the students embarking on the start of third-level education today expect when that day finally arrives? The first thing to say, according to Sharon McCooey, head of LinkedIn Ireland, is that “the only certainty in life is uncertainty”, as she points to events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war in recent years. “The first piece of advice I give anyone thinking about what course to study at university is that many job opportunities available today are very different from a decade ago,” she says. “What students need to keep in mind is that they are at the beginning of a journey of lifelong learning. Key to that journey is an adaptable mindset as the reality is today’s graduates are likely to change careers multiple times over their lifetime.” Her sentiments are shared by Pawel Adrjan, an economist and director of EMEA economic research at jobs website Indeed. “If the past few years have taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected,” he says. “So while some areas look set for increased demand over coming years, the best thing an early careerist can do is make sure they get a broad range of experience early on. A degree can be a jumping off point and does not necessarily dictate what you have to do for the rest of your life. “Take stock of your values, skills and aptitudes. Look at the key skills that your degree gives you, and then look at where they best transfer. That will help you map out avenues you might like to explore in your career. “It’s also important to identify what your priorities are when looking for a job. Is salary key or would you be willing to trade off for more flexibility? What learning opportunities would you like to access? Would you like to travel or work from a certain location? “These priorities are likely to change throughout your career so it’s good to check in with yourself regularly as your priorities shift.” Undergraduate course selection is the first chapter in your career story rather than a high-pressure lifelong decision— Brendan Lally, University of Limerick careers adviser University of Limerick (UL) careers adviser Brendan Lally also acknowledges the uncertainties with predicting the future jobs market, but says school leavers “should expect lifelong learning to include upskilling and re-skilling with multiple career changes as people work longer”. “What you’re good at now and what your parents and teachers have helped you identify as your strengths is just a starting point,” he says. “Undergraduate course selection is more a first chapter in your career story rather than a high-pressure lifelong decision. “There are current students at the University of Limerick and other campuses around the country studying for careers that may not exist yet or will be radically different in 10 years’ time. “Many of next year’s first years in higher education will study for careers that have yet to be defined. So, students preparing for third-level must be more conscious of the world they live in rather than just their world.” Lally points to Government reports of “future skills needs” that can provide useful information for those making choices and which give rise to in-demand courses. “They give good indications of what can be expected and point to growth in green technology, bio medical and bio pharma,” he says. “The upward trajectory of tech and, in particular, the challenges around privacy and cyber security point to other rapid growth areas. Demographics point to an ageing population, with challenges around care and health. “Engineering will continue to advance with automation, robotics and machine learning, and the impact of AI and big data to name but a few.” LinkedIn’s McCooey agrees that areas such as the green economy are likely to be bountiful hunting grounds for jobseekers down the tracks. “Obviously there are industries like technology and pharma that are in high demand, as well as more traditional industries that will always be hiring such as the legal and engineering sectors,” she says. “For example, one of the most popular roles advertised on LinkedIn last year was for software engineers. “Naturally sectors like the tech, healthcare and legal sectors will continue to need large pipelines of talent, but we will also see new areas emerge, particularly in the green economy. “Looking at the area of climate change, it’s obvious that many industries need to change and there will be opportunities across the board, whether it is a reimagining of traditional areas like the boom in retrofitting in the construction sector or a future demand for expertise about renewable energy sources like wind turbines. “In the past five years, the number of renewables and environment jobs in the US has increased by 237 per cent. We expect a similar boom in demand in Ireland.” McCooey says the five fastest growing green jobs between 2016 and 2021 were sustainability managers, wind turbine technicians, solar consultants, ecologists, and environmental health and safety specialists. Indeed’s Adrjan says demand for healthcare roles – which was boosted by the pandemic – will persevere in the years ahead. “Since the pandemic we have seen consistent high demand across essential services such as healthcare – at the moment therapy, pharmacy and home care are particularly in demand,” he says. “When trying to predict a prosperous career path, one thing to look at is currently pressing problems or developing areas – environmental issues, socio economic development, digital connectivity – these can be a good predictor of where demand will lie. “Trends indicate demand for remote work will continue in office-based roles, which means that graduates may need to prepare to enter a new hybrid workforce, and must be ready to adapt to that style of working from the outset.” If you take the same role from 2015 to 2022, roughly 25 per cent of the skills that are required for that role have changed— Sharon McCooey, head of LinkedIn Ireland Most of the experts agree that the best thing students can do as they begin life at third-level education is to build a bank of transferrable skills rather than worrying too much about the specifics of what they are doing. “If you have an obvious interest in an area like tech or law, obviously pursue your passion,” says McCooey. “If it’s a case, however, that you are simply choosing a course based on a greater chance of getting employed once you graduate, it is important to know that you can always study something that you enjoy and then add extra qualifications or learn additional skills required for a role. “Employers are rethinking hiring and increasingly placing greater emphasis on a candidate’s skills and overall potential to ensure great talent is not overlooked. This is actually a really important consideration for very specialised areas. “For example, AI is a sector that’s on the rise, but the pipeline of talent available is quite small, so most organisations have to rely on professionals transitioning into the space,” McCooey says. “Recent LinkedIn data shows us that if you take the same role from 2015 to 2022, roughly 25 per cent of the skills that are required for that role have changed. “For example, Jira, Kubernetes and Python were among the top 10 skills added by LinkedIn members in the IT sector during 2021 contrasting with more traditional skills like SQL, JavaScript and Software Development topping the list back in 2015. “Ultimately, a key takeaway for any student is that you do not stop your education journey when you graduate. “By the time this generation enters the workforce, hiring practices will be reimagined in that the focus will not simply be on your degree – recruiters will be looking at your core skills and how adaptable you are.” UL’s Lally pushes the importance that school leavers understand that deep learning, even in big demand disciplines, is not enough to ensure guaranteed future success. “In higher education what defines success can often be viewed as the grade you come out with at the end,” he says. “Graduate recruiters in organisations will define success more broadly. “In your final year, graduate employers will want you to show them evidence and examples of your ability and transferable skills. Skills required can include evidence of collaboration, resilience, learning agility, growth mind-set, critical analysis, initiative, drive and adaptability. “Much of this will be determined by what you do outside the classroom and lecture theatre. My tip for reaching your career goals is not only to study hard... Your future employment and life prospects will improve with experiences such as a work placement, a study abroad Erasmus experience with foreign language opportunity, part-time jobs, sports participation, campus societies and volunteering. “These will allow you to take ownership and demonstrate skills and ability. Balancing your time for all of this is difficult, but prospective employers recognise this and target those that do it well.” Lally advises students at this point in their journeys to devote one hour per week to their “own personal career education”. “Your college career service and website will have everything you need, to plan ahead,” he says. They can help you with self-awareness; job market analysis; how best to present yourself; and how to understand how employers will assess you.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Private sector delivering more than seven in 10 new social homes, department figures show',\n",
       "  'text': 'More than two-thirds of the social housing units delivered in the first nine months of last year were procured directly from private developers, underscoring the State’s reliance on the private sector to deliver housing. Figures obtained from the Department of Housing show that 2,706 new-build social homes were delivered up to the end of September last year. Of these, 1,946 units (72 per cent) were acquired by way of so-called turnkey purchases – where the local authority or approved housing body (AHB) enters into a forward-purchasing arrangement with a private developer – or through the Part V rule, which stipulates developers must set aside a certain portion of their developments for social housing. [ IDA officials anxious about impact of housing crisis on inward investment, emails show ] Turnkeys represented 54 per cent (1,452) of the total while Part Vs represented 18 per cent (294). Twenty-eight per cent (760 homes) were delivered directly by local authorities via the Social Housing Capital Investment Programme or by approved housing bodies through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility. The figures were provided by Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien in response to a parliamentary question from Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin. Mr Ó Broin said: “Turnkeys in and of themselves are not a problem but the heavy overreliance on private developers to deliver social housing is very risky.” The core problem was the level of red tape imposed on local authorities doing their own developments, he said. “Until the Government fixes that red tape, there will be a perverse incentive to continue overrelying on private developers,” Mr Ó Broin said. “And at a time when commencements are falling, that’s a high-risk strategy.” [ Relying on private sector to build houses a ‘vulnerability’, officials say ] Reliance on the private sector to deliver housing was highlighted as a “vulnerability” in a briefing document prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its new Minister, Paschal Donohoe, when he took up the role last month. The document highlighted structural issues such as planning and construction costs as a “challenge” to delivery of Government targets. It estimated that up to 6,500 social homes would be delivered in 2022 (the end-year figures have not been released yet), down from a target of 8,000. But even this figure may be at risk with just 2,706 delivered in the first nine months of 2022. With new housing commencements falling, department officials raised concern that housing targets would continue to come under pressure. There was a 14 per cent year-on-year decline in new housing units commenced in the third quarter of 2022, which industry officials and analysts linked to the rapid acceleration in build costs. In his response to Mr Ó Broin, Mr O’Brien said: “Housing for All is the Government’s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade. “This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over €4 billion per annum, through an overall combination of €12 billion in direct exchequer funding, €3.5 billion in funding through the Land Development Agency and €5 billion funding through the Housing Finance Agency,” he said.',\n",

       "  'text': 'People who know Michael Stone - or Mick, as he is known to those close to him - say he has sounded shell-shocked over Paschal Donohoe’s election posters controversy. For a very private individual who takes great pride in working hard, below the radar, being at the centre of a political and media storm is not somewhere where the 54-year-old Dubliner likes to be. This is behind his decision to stand down from two public roles, as chairman of the North East Inner City Programme Implementation Board and as a board member of the Land Development Agency, after admitting that he helped his friend, Paschal Donohoe, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, erected posters in a second general election, in 2020. Stone said in a statement on Tuesday morning that he did not want the controversy to be “a distraction” from the “very important” work of the two bodies. “I think he is feeling pretty sore. I think he just feels that no good deed goes unpunished,” said one person who knows him and has worked closely with him. “He just feels like people are talking about him and he likes to fly below the radar. I think he is finding it pretty difficult.” Donohoe admitted omitting a sum of €1,057 from his 2016 general election expenses covering the use of a van provided by a company run by Stone and the payment of six workers to erect election posters in the Fine Gael Minister’s Dublin Central constituency in the election. In Stone’s statement on Tuesday, he said he had mistakenly told Donohoe - in December and again last week- that he had not provided the politician with help on postering in the 2020 general election only to later discover that he had when he “re-checked” the matter. He apologised to Donohoe and confirmed that he, through a member of the Fine Gael team in Dublin Central, personally paid for six people to poster at a cost of €972 and for supplying some of the individuals with vans for the postering work at a commercial value of €434.20. “I deeply regret any embarrassment that I have caused Paschal for my mistaken recollection in relation to 2020 and for what I thought was modest help for hardworking honest politician,” said Stone. Pocket change The sums involved must seem like pocket change to the successful businessman. He owns The Design Group, a mechanical and electrical engineering business he founded in 1992. The “mech-and-elec” people are the ones who come in to fit out a property once built. The business recorded a turnover of €175 million and a profit of almost €18 million in the year to the end of March last, according to its latest accounts. It ended the year with cash of €36 million. The group pocketed a one-off gain of €15 million during the year, selling the remaining 50 per cent of its facilities management division to Sisk, a joint venture partner since 2019. The Design Group employs more than 700 people and works on projects in Ireland, the UK, Africa, Europe and North America. Among its projects are the refit of the Shelbourne Hotel, the Technology University Dublin campus at Grangegorman in Donohoe’s own constituency, work on Dublin Castle prior to Ireland’s EU presidency in 2013 and the Qantas lounge at Heathrow Airport in London. The company’s work on commercial properties, data centres and life sciences facilities and for bluechip clients ranging from Amazon to Microsoft to Hilton means that the Dublin 11-registered business has performed exceptionally well in recent years. The success of the group is a long way from Stone’s humble beginnings, growing up on Aughrim Street in Dublin. The proud inner-city Dubliner started working as an apprentice at the ESB while still a teenager. He was identified by the semi-state as a high-flier who was given the electrical training that has stood to him when it came time to setting up his own business. That decision came when he was 24. He has admitted that if had stayed another couple of years at the ESB, it would have become a job for life. Instead he wanted to break out on his own. “But the opportunity was there and I’m very ambitious. I love work. A semi-state body was probably a bit restrictive for me. I wanted that feeling of being my own boss. I had just got married and not long afterwards my first child was born. If I had left it until after that I would been too afraid,” he said. The Design Group’s expansion internationally before the 2008 property crash meant that it weathered the economic storm that took out many other companies in the construction sector. The reach of his company brought profile and standing for Stone in the industry. He served as president of the Electrical Contractors’ Association and of the Mechanical Engineering & Building Services Contractors Association before stepping up to become president of the powerful lobby group, the Construction Industry Federation, between 2014 and 2016. Dogged work ethic Commercial success has brought personal wealth. Last year, he paid €4.6 million for a house on Killiney Hill designed by Irish architect Jack O’Hare, an apprentice of the famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The home has panoramic views of Killiney Bay and is set on more than an acre of gardens amid some of the country’s most expensive postcodes. Outside of work, he is a lifelong GAA fan. Stone played senior inter-county hurling for Dublin and is a member of Eoghan Rua GAA club, now amalgamated with Oliver Plunketts. Friends talk about Stone’s impressive levels of energy and focus, and how has brought the dogged work ethic that made his business such a success into the two public roles. As chairman of the North East Inner City Programme Implementation Board, he oversaw the area’s social and economic regeneration, a project close to his heart given his roots in the area. “Mick Stone is a massive loss for Dublin’s north east inner city,” said Feargal O’Rourke, managing partner at PWC Ireland and a member of the board. “As a member, I have seen first hand his role on the Inner City group and he has done more in recent years for this area than anyone else in the country. He is very hands on and has put hundreds of hours in to improve the area and the lot of the people living there, without any personal agenda or compensation. He will simply be impossible to replace.” Stone joined the board of the State’s Land Development Authority in 2019 in an appointment made by the then minister for housing Eoghan Murphy. He received no fees for his role on the inner-city programme and has waived his yearly fee of €15,759 from the LDA. In a sign of Stone’s diligence, one colleague at the LDA remembers him video-calling into a meeting of the board while he was on a business trip to Mexico at about 4am local time. Above and beyond “He goes way above and beyond and in that sense he really does have the public service ethos and is very committed to both housing and inner-city development,” he said. Stone is said to have been particularly proud of the LDA’s first big housing development, a project of 600 social and affordable homes on State land at Shanganagh, south of Shankill, providing much needed homes for the south Dublin and north Wicklow area. One colleague, speaking before Stone’s resignation, expressed concern at his potential departure from the LDA and the loss of “a genuine expert who has a deep understanding of how projects all fit together.” “What I would be concerned about is that he would just disappear into the background,” said the source who puts his help in Donohoe election postering down to his willingness to help a friend and politician he respected. “I am sure it never cost him a thought, throwing up a few posters.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Minister of State of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Pippa Hackett welcomed the significant progress highlighted in the Organic Strategy Forum report published today. The Report summarised the activities of the Forum in its first year of operation and was presented to the Minister by the Forum Chair, Mr. Padraig Brennan. The Forum was established by the Minister to bring together all relevant stakeholders in the Organic sector to drive forward the development of the sector and tackle barriers to its future growth. The Forum comprises representatives from relevant State Agencies, farm bodies, organic food processors and organic certification bodies. Minister Hackett stated “The Organic Strategy Forum has played a key role in identifying practical solutions to some of the barriers to the growth of the sector. I commend the work of the Chair, Padraig Brennan and the stakeholders for their work in identifying both issues and solutions to allow us to build on the experienced and dedicated cohort of organic farmers and processors we have here in Ireland. One of the priorities of the forum was to increase the critical mass of the organic sector and this was reflected in the record number of 2,100 new applications in Autumn 2022 to join the Organic Farming Scheme. We will drive on with this now and reopen the scheme again before the end of 2023”. “Development of new market opportunities for our increasing organic output is a clear priority for all of us this year. This will be a key focus of minein 2023, including leading a trade mission with Irish companies to the world’s largest organic trade fair, Biofach in Germany, next month”. The priorities for the Organic Strategy Forum in 2023 are highlighted in the progress report and reiterate the requirement to further increase participation in organic farming over the coming years to capitalise on the significant uptake recorded in 2022. Equally important priorities include: The co-ordination of organic supplies and reducing leakageDeveloping the market for Irish organic foodGreen procurementEducationInfrastructure and the capturing of accurate organic production data Chair of the Organic Strategy Forum, Padraig Brennan, concluded: “I would like to thank Minister Hackett for her strong support for the Organic Strategy Forum. The support and constructive engagement of the Forum members and their strong advocacy for organic farmers, producers and consumers ensures that we are well positioned to anticipate and proactively respond to the challenges and opportunities facing the organic food sector. Given the rapidly evolving marketplace and the ever-increasing focus on the environment, the expertise and experience of Forum members will be decisive in maintaining an upward growth in the value of the organic food sector. I look forward to working in partnership with the Department and the Forum members to ensure that the growth potential of this increasingly important sector is fully realised.” END Note for Editors: The Organic Strategy Forum progress report is available at the following link',\n",

To help answer your question, I feel we should look back a little at the source of these inflationary issues before we gaze into the crystal ball for the future. Before Covid (remember that?) we experienced a very long (almost zero) inflationary period when labour and material prices increased, but unless it was over a sustained period of time, it didn't have a huge impact on your project cost. In most cases, it would make little or no difference to the cost of your project throughout its duration. Then, in 2020, we had the first Covid lockdown (which lasted about six months) followed eventually by the reopening of the economy and construction sector. There was a sudden burst of energy where we began to build houses, commercial buildings, factories and infrastructure once again. There was not any significant inflation or lack of materials at the beginning of this reopening, but why was that? From what I have learned, if you remember way back then, we had been making provisions for the chaos Brexit might bring. As a result, we had significant stockpiles of most materials in place to smooth out the inevitable supply chain friction. In truth, Brexit was dwarfed by Covid, but these stockpiles facilitated a reasonably smooth exit from the first lockdown and let's face it, nobody really noticed or spoke of any difficulties. Fast forward to the following series of lockdowns and reopenings, we had no more stockpiles so when factories, transport and warehousing was mothballed, the real problems started. I remember getting a phone call from a manager of a building supplier who told me that there would be very significant delays and material price hikes ahead for even the most basic of building materials. We experienced this issue for some time but like most issues, the market reacts and gets to grips with the issue. Then, about this time last year, I spoke to the same building supplier manager, who told me that he expected things to start levelling and likely improve as 2022 wore on. Cue the beginning of the war in Ukraine a month later. Now, all bets are off. We have seamlessly transitioned from Brexit stockpiles to Covid related supply chain issues to an energy crisis with Russia controlling much of the world's gas, who knew? All of a sudden, while supply timelines were reasonable, prices soured again, particularly for materials whose productions are energy intensive. So, now it's that time of year again. I have been getting soundings from said building supplier company that they are cautiously optimistic. Some elements, for example, rough timber and steel (which were some of the first materials to rise) have in fact dropped a little, many elements are more or less level, and there are a few elements which are still rising, particularly plastering & quarried products (concrete blocks, aggregates, cement). So, has the market absorbed the full ramifications of the war in Ukraine? Maybe to date but who knows what way this war may twist and turn this year. We all hope it will come to an end soon but no one knows. Most builders are not taking inflation risk as they cannot measure it so the consumer (you) is having to carry it. Will prices come back down? My sense is that when there are significant reductions in input costs, these will be passed on as there will be pressure on the construction industry to do so given the fact that interest rates are rising at present. When and by how much will things improve, I don't know, but I am certainly looking ahead with cautious optimism this year, that is unless something new arrives on the horizon.

       "  'title': 'Irish investment consortium in €6.5m deal for landmark Donnybrook Mall',\n",
       "  'text': 'A consortium of private investors based in the west of Ireland has paid about €6.5 million for the landmark Donnybrook Mall in Dublin 4. Acquired by developer Sean Dunne for €17 million at the height of the last boom, the mall last changed hands in 2014, with its outgoing owner, an individual private Irish investor, paying €6.6 million to secure ownership of the 1,448sq m (15,590sq ft) property. On this occasion the scheme was offered to the market by agent Lisney last September at a guide price of €6.8 million. The buyers are believed to have secured the property in the face of competition from a number of parties. The mall’s new owners will have the benefit of immediate rental income of €450,343 annually from a strong tenant line-up which includes Tesco, Lloyds Pharmacy, the well-known dry cleaners Lyknu, Abrakebabra, and the long-established bridalwear boutique Marian Gale. The complex’s development potential is borne out by its positive planning history with one of Sean Dunne’s companies, Padholme, securing permission from Dublin City Council in 2008 for a three-storey over-basement mixed-use development of 3,455sq m (37,189sq ft) comprising six retail units, two office units, one restaurant/takeaway, one bank unit and four two-bedroom apartments as well as 15 car spaces. The permission was subsequently extended in 2014 to 2019. Donnybrook has seen significant residential development over recent years, with much of this aimed towards the upper end of Dublin’s private rented sector (PRS) market. Richmond Homes is currently at an advanced stage of building 139 apartments at Eglington Place on the corner of Eglington Road and Donnybrook Road, while Keith Craddock’s Red Rock Donnybrook Ltd obtained planning permission for a 10-storey 84-apartment build-to-rent scheme on the Circle K petrol station site opposite Bective Rangers’ rugby grounds. Developer Shane Whelan’s Westridge Real Estate, meanwhile, is developing a 91-unit co-living scheme across seven storeys on the site of the former Kiely’s public house. At Donnybrook Crescent construction is under way of Lovett House which is an eight-storey mixed-used development containing 49 build-to-rent apartments.',\n",

       "  'text': 'With demand falling, the amount of \"grey space,\" in Cork, defined as spare office accommodation that remains dormant despite being leased, is also likely to rise further in the new year, with many occupiers considering subletting surplus office space that they no longer need. The trend comes amid a surge in job cuts across Ireland\\'s tech sector, along with working from home and global uncertainty causing a major shift in post-pandemic work practices. Research published last year showed that 78% of employees wanted to stay working from home, and as energy prices continue to put a strain on office expenses, many companies have facilitated this by enabling more flexible working conditions. Despite already significant vacancy rates, estate agent, Lisney Sothebys has warned that Cork is 12 months behind Dublin, where grey space already accounts for a third of the capital\\'s commercial property. The agency has warned that commerical vacancy rates could increase even further in Cork, leading to a reduction in headline rents, with the report finding that even if they remain unchanged, landlords will need to offer greater incentive packages to influence demand. While the supply of commercial property remains bouyant, residential accommodation in Cork is still heavily undersupplied, with the agency saying that it remains so despite a 62% increase in 2022. Furthermore, the construction of new homes also started to fall back in the second half of last year following a surge in construction costs and funding needs, with Lisney Sotheby\\'s warning that this will continue to be an issue this year, further impacting supply which will be particularly difficult for first time buyers. While forecasts for the upper-end of the residential market remain strong, the agency has warned that the mid and entry level parts will continue to experience affordability issues to a greater extent as mortgage rates increase and disposable income levels fall.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Loan approvals at Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), the Government agency charged with funding the delivery of new homes, have increased by 49 per cent, new data has shown. The agency said total loan approvals at the end of 2022 amounted to just under €1.25 billion, up from a total of €835 million at the end of 2021. Almost three-quarters of that figure has already been drawn down, at €909 million for 60 developments, with 4,132 units under construction or completed. That means around €413 million was approved for new housing projects over the course of last year. But the figures also showed a slowdown in the rate of new approvals in the latter half of 2022. Between January and June, some €325 million in loan approvals were logged, with that figure dropping to €88 million in the second half of the year. “The first half of 2022 was our busiest ever six-month period in terms of loan approvals and, while we saw a lower level of applications and new approvals in the second half reflecting a slowdown in construction activity across the market, feedback from housebuilders indicates that demand for new funding is resilient despite the challenges of construction price inflation and higher interest rates,” said HBFI chief executive Dara Deering. HBFI has approved funding for more than 5,700 new homes in 99 developments, spread across 21 counties. Around a quarter of those home are social housing, with 50 per cent for owner occupiers, 20 per cent for renters and 5 per cent for Part V, which stipulates developers must set aside a portion of their developments for social housing. More than 1,200 HBFI-funded units have already been sold, and a further 1,800 were contracted for sale or sale agreed at the end of 2022. The majority of the homes – 70 per cent – funded by HBFI are two- or three-bed units aimed at the first-time buyer market. The average overall facility size has remained around €13 million, with individual loan facilities ranging from €1 million to €94 million. “Through its broad product range, and agile business model, HBFI plays a key role in the Government’s strategy to meet the targets set out under Housing for All. Today’s update highlights the strong performance by HBFI over the last six months,” said the Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath. “With viability remaining challenging for the construction sector, I welcome HBFI’s commitment to work with customers and stakeholders to support a continued increase in housing supply in the market. I am confident HBFI will continue to work to monitor the risks and opportunities for future funding.” HBFI was established by the Government in late 2018 to address a shortfall in finance available for the construction of residential housing by providing finance at market rates to commercially viable developments.',\n",

       "  'title': 'New rules on collective bargaining could transform union landscape, says Ictu general secretary Owen Reidy',\n",
       "  'text': 'Proposed changes to the rules of engagement between employers and trade unions could give more workers meaningful representation in their workplaces, Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) general secretary Owen Reidy says. Appointed late last year to succeed Patricia King as general secretary, 50-year-old Reidy from Donegal describes the Minimum Wage Directive and its promotion of the increased collective bargaining coverage clause as “probably the most progressive thing from a workers’ rights point of view that’s come out of the European Union in the last two decades”. In addition, the anticipated implementation of the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) High-Level Working Group on Collective Bargaining is set to require companies to engage with unions in “good faith”. Combined, the two measures could mark a major turning point for unions that have been battling hard for quite some time to maintain membership numbers even as the nation’s workforce expanded dramatically. [ Why has Isme been left out of collective bargaining forum? ] “There’s a lot in the directive,” Reidy says. “In a nutshell, it will oblige the government to seek to promote collective bargaining between unions and employers, negotiating on pay both locally and at sectoral level. Collective bargaining coverage in Ireland is about 34 per cent, that’s including public service. Union density (membership levels) among all workers is about 27 or 28 per cent. “So there are some people who aren’t in unions but get the benefit of an agreement. But the commission is basically saying we need to see collective bargaining coverage around 80 per cent which would be doubling it in Ireland.” This, he suggests, is partly down to European leaders reacting to the rise of the sort of populism that yielded Brexit and far-right election successes in a number of countries. “The current commission is led by Ursula von der Leyen who is from the centre right but it has made it clear that work must pay because they want the centre to hold. We, as part of the European Trade Union movement, said ‘well, the best way for work to pay is through collective bargaining, not necessarily through minimum wages; it’s through facilitating unions and employers to negotiate’.” The LEEF High Level Group, which included union leaders, academics, senior figures from the Irish Business and Employers’ Confederation (Ibec) and the construction industry and Government officials, delivered a report in October that sets out the grounds on which collective bargaining can be reformed in Ireland. Included in the report was a provision that firms be obliged to engage in “good faith” with unions. If the employers fail to do so, even where unions are representing relatively small numbers of their workers, they can ultimately end up before the courts. One senior Siptu official says that would “save the union movement” as many private sector employers who currently decline to engage could be obliged to. That would potentially make union membership far more appealing in sectors like the traditional powerhouse of manufacturing where it is now running at 13 per cent according to a report by the Geary Institute at UCD. In hospitality, with its many low-paid jobs, it was found to be close to half that. In his previous role as minister for enterprise, Leo Varadkar suggested the provisions could become law this year, although the department’s briefing document for his successor, Simon Coveney, suggests 2024 may be more likely. Reidy credits the now Taoiseach with some progressive legislation while at the department but says there may be “forces” there who are less than enthusiastic about any substantial changes to the labour relations landscape. Given the stakes, he suggests, the unions may have to fight their corner although he believes there is an understanding on the employers’ side that many of the proposed changes can help to provide long-term stability. “I do think, you know, in the 21st century, it makes sense to kind of share power, it makes sense to operate collectively across Europe in a multilateral world, and it makes sense to try and improve workers voice in the labour market,” he says before suggesting Ibec’s Danny McCoy may largely agree. While LEEF’s work to date has been important, he says, “we would like, like Ibec, a much more deeper, more meaningful involvement”. [ Fintan O’Toole: Want to change the world? Join a union ] Reidy understands, he says, the lingering discomfort in some quarters with aspects of partnership but argues that Government, by improving things like public transport, delivering better healthcare and providing increased support in areas like childcare, can help maintain or improve living standards without workers having to rely entirely on wage increases. This, he believes, is a large part of the pay off for companies who, he contends, must pay for the bulk of the additional public expenditure envisaged through increased taxes. Beyond that he insists the Ictu and its affiliates are in a decent position to build off the back of the changes with issues like pay and remote working providing a strong basis for connecting with members new and old. [ New Ictu general secretary Owen Reidy targets recruitment of young members as priority ] “The legislation isn’t going to organise any workers,” he says, “but I do think with a fair wind it’ll facilitate and create the capacity for unions to up their game when it comes to organising more workers.” Not everything in that UCD report, Union Voice in Ireland, would provide encouragement but Reidy refers more than once to a finding that 66 per cent of young workers in non-union environments say they would like to join a union. “It’s exciting,” he says, at the prospect of all that young union blood. It must be. It will certainly have been a while coming.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Over 28,700 units of large developments are awaiting An Bord Pleanála permission',\n",
       "  'text': 'A TOTAL of 28,786 units in housing and apartment developments are awaiting a planning permission decision from An Bord Pleanála, new analysis has found. The annual constructor sector report from consultants Mitchell McDermott found that 59% of Strategic Housing Developments (SHDs) applications before An Bord Plenála last year did not receive a decision. The SHD system was designed as a fast-track planning process for schemes of 100 apartments or houses. The analysis found that the Bord granted permission for just 26% of applications, or almost 13,000 units. “Everyone knows the Bord has had its issues this year but to have so many units deplayed amid a housing crisis is unacceptable,” Paul Mitchell, one of the authors of the report, said. “You would imagine this backlog could easily be addressed by drafting in additional resources from private practice here or from the UK and we believe this should be done straight away,” he said. There was a 79% drop in the number of judicial reviews taken against SHDs last year. Mitchell said the firm found the reduction was due in large measure to the large drop in the number of decisions being made by An Board Pleanála on SHDs. The report found that a total of 31,125 units in SHDs which received planning permission have been subjected to judicial reviews over the past five years. “Just 10% or so have gone ahead, 10,727 units were quashed, while 17,805 are still awaiting a decision from the courts – a total of 28,532,” Mitchell said. A second of the report focused on tracking the number of SHDs which received planning permission between 2018 and 2022 but have not yet commenced. It found that of the 103,057 SHD units which received planning permission during this period, 28,755 (28%) have not yet commenced. Construction costs The report also found that the construction costs of a two-bed mid-range apartment increased by 9.6% or between €21,000 to €25,000 last year. The hard costs of building a two-bed, medium rise suburban apartment is now over €240,000, it found. The main contributors to the increase are mechanical and electrical services, up 18%, concrete, up 27%, brickwork, up 39%, and reinforcement steel, up 17%. The €240,000 figure excludes indirect costs, parking, siteworks, margin and VAT. If those are included the total cost of delivering the apartment is in the region of €460,000; the sales price would have to equal or exceed this.',\n",

       "  'title': \"The political Unionist cake is not growing. Only who wins the bigger slice alters. – Slugger O'Toole\",\n",
       "  'text': 'A publication for Church leaders recently headlined ‘the rise of the ‘dones’; a growing number of people who are ‘done with the Church.’ They have not abandoned their faith but have ‘de-churched.’ Attendance figures bear this out. One interviewee commented: ’they have heard it all and are tired of the same routine; being lectured to without any meaningful engagement or participation.’ Church scandals have played their part. The situation resonates with Northern Ireland as political parties exhibit a ‘this is the way mentality’; that without tight control and direction, everything will fall apart and decision-making will lose focus; But this sort of detached leadership is becoming less attractive. Bored with politics and politicians that convert every issue and political discourse into an arena for conflict and narrow political allegiances, a growing proportion of the population is not merely rejecting historical religious labelling and identities but their closely associated political affiliations. Polling and university research on prevailing demographics show consistent growth in the middle ground with the mainline parties, nationalist-republican and unionist, left to engage in internecine electoral battles to win the biggest share of their chosen but steadily reducing constituencies. The political Unionist cake is not growing. Only who wins the greater slice alters. Within unionism, many continue to support the maintenance of the Union however it is not just millennials and those who voted to remain in the EU who comprise a sizeable proportion, increasingly de-motivated and feeling unrepresented; disenfranchised by the limited ambition and accountability of political Unionism. An expedient unanimity of shared but tenuous, – if recent UUP spokespersons are to be believed – and divergent unease with and antipathy, across broad unionism, towards the Ireland/Northern Ireland protocol, cannot mask what is hidden in plain sight. Unease with the protocol, genuine as it may be, does not equate to support or approval for past and present decision-making by political unionism. With its traits of being intolerant, legalistic and irrelevant to the lived experiences of many, a growing constituency of individuals are ‘done’ with it and want a shift of focus. Where creative thinking is an imperative, unionists are offered robotic compliance by representatives entrenched in a culture of small mindedness; only comfortable in a culture bunker. This getting the meaning of the Union muddled with abstractions. There is much evidence. For the many who are placed on long waiting lists for healthcare if they are lucky, it is small comfort that as they suffer pain and maybe die, they do so under the Union flag. If is this what the Union means, the many tattered flags which adorn lamp-posts offer a stark symbolism. Too often unionist politics, pre-and post the Good Friday Agreement, are characterised by a failure to move beyond damage limitation and a lingering sense of ‘what has been given up’ crisis management. When immediate pressure is relieved, a sense of false certainty results and unionism reverts back to old behaviour; lack of transparency, failed leadership models, limited sense of mission and exclusivity. Capacity is not built to shape a long-term commitment to re-culturing and renewal; to build on growing success in key areas of the economy, education and culture to make Northern Ireland work for all; not seek to revert to ‘ ruling the roost.’ Rigidity in ideology and delusional claims to building reconciliation serve only to emphasise how unionism has facilitated the ugly scaffolding of the Good Friday Agreement to produce the ugly politics which have stalled or diverted the process inherent within the 1998 Agreement. This runs counter to the rationale for the scaffolding and is out of kilter with many pro-Union individuals and groups who do not work this way in their lives or communal and societal settings. Different civic organisations are gaining attention in numerous disciplines and sectors as vehicles for community building, promoting wellbeing and social change. Participatory actions and discourse challenge marginalisation and socio-political exclusion. This is the opposite of regulated political unionism which, frozen in an orthodoxy dating from the establishment of Northern Ireland, remains uncomfortable with disruption and challenge, internal and external. Such is also evident, not least in unionism’s willingness to operate and tinker at the edge of the Good Friday Agreement with little involvement or interest in North-South Bodies. It may yet fall off the edge. In 1998, Unionist and Nationalist-Republican parties, with others, were given the opportunity to emerge from prolonged conflict; to govern within a devolved continuum which did not shut out or call for the abandonment of long held constitutional preferences. The challenge to each of the designated MLAs, not least within the largest parties, was to persuade a majority of the community to endorse their platform for change, or not; whilst adhering to a popular mandate to implement the three strands of the Good Friday Agreement to the benefit of all. What has resulted is a fixed pattern of attrition, antagonistic populism and financial impropriety. This is a choice of the parties who populate the structures. The co-guarantors in London and Dublin are not without responsibility in indulging the political eco-system that pertains. Cobbled together lifeboat measures like A Fresh Start and New Decade, New Approach have not delivered promised outcomes or clear direction. Many pro-union voters have arrived at a point where they will no longer condone the complicity of political unionism in this power dynamic that staggers between ineffectiveness and posturing; crisis and erratic duration. Results do not equate to the resources made available whilst the main parties remain wedded to traditional platforms as a camouflage for self-interest, tribal power and privilege. Sometimes also to the benefit of relatives and family members who find employment funded by generous expenses. For anyone wishing to promote the Union, this is a deficit strategy destined to deliver long-term failure; a structural and electoral blind spot, preferring safeguards to growth. Unionism, like many groups and individuals, needs to move beyond its traditional binary interpretation and promotion of the Union by abandoning its PUL branding and creaking back of a lorry rhetoric. It needs to expand its scope and incorporate inclusivity into its analyses and networks; become more aspirational for the whole community. Build consensus by reducing space between people and move finally from tactics based on demographic dominance. As the Union is de-constructed and re-imagined at Westminster an alternative form of politically inclusive and consensual unionism is an imperative. It needs to draw on and make itself relevant to the lives of diverse sectors and groups which define the community. On recent performance, it is a big ask for Unionist political representatives in parties which seem to value the past more than a better future. Led by leaders and favoured cadres who promote blind loyalty, with silence used to monopolise power, there is limited evidence of any creative critique or strategic discourse. Yet, the time is opportune to embrace and coalesce around peace, justice, equality, inclusion, humanity and well-being. However, discouraged from thinking for themselves, representatives lend their minds to the leadership. This surely must produce a system of under-used assets and ignorance which filters into policies and practice; some views paramount whilst others are summarily dismissed. Resulting distortion by a dominant and rigid ideology underpinned by normative values is a long-standing trait of political unionism ensues. It is being eroded. Women, LBGTQ, diverse ethnic communities, younger people, socially liberal and marginalised people who reflect the historic hidden experience of unionism now conclude and demonstrate that a top-down framework is not conducive to building vital consensus around social, economic, health, housing, cultural and education issues; addressing wasteful segregation and lasting reconciliation to make Northern Ireland for all. Political Unionism needs to move beyond honeyed and condescending rhetoric when addressing non-aligned unionism and the community; grasp the possibilities; recognise and embrace the dynamic desire for a more pluralist and inclusive place, beyond narrow designations and identities. The longer this takes, the greater will be the growth in those muted conversations which are taking place as to how Northern Ireland needs to work better for all. There will be a cruel irony if the Union, currently on offer from those who value it most whilst going out of their way to distort its core purposes, acts as the author of its own demise. Will those who are ‘ done’ with political Unionism come to a point were they are done with this Union? It is not inconceivable that out of the continuing division and rigidity, a new mutuality will grow.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Home sales volumes down as prices jump 9.7%',\n",
       "  'text': 'The number of homes sold in the final three months of 2022 was more than 7 per cent lower than in the same period of 2021, with an almost 10 per cent jump in sales prices in the year, analysis of the Property Price Register (PPR) has indicated. Some 16,881 residential units, both new and existing, were sold in the fourth quarter of last year, 3,332 of which were new homes, according to a report from property tech start-up Geowox. This represents a 7.4 per cent decline in overall sales from the fourth quarter of 2021, when some 18,225 units changed hands. The figures are based on sales data rather than asking prices, with the reporting of a sale to the PPR often lagging behind the transaction itself. But despite the apparent drop in volumes, house prices climbed 9.7 per cent across the State between October and the end of December last year, with the median price of a home increasing by €27,000 over the 12-month period to €304,000, according to the data. On a county-by-county basis, Dublin had the highest volume of sales in the last quarter at 4,763, representing 28.2 per cent of the total, Geowox’s analysis showed. Dublin, where the median price of a property sold in the final three months of 2022 was €420,000, also remained the most expensive county in Ireland. Dublin and its commuter counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow were the only counties where prices were above the Statewide median. The data for the Republic as a whole indicates that property price inflation, which cooled throughout the year amid rising borrowing costs and cost-of-living pressures, remained relatively stable in the second half of 2022. The annual rate of increase was 9.5 per cent in the year to the end of September 2022, according to Geowox’s last report, compared with a 14 per cent increase in the 12 months to the end of June. The figures broadly tally with Central Statistics Office data, published last week, which indicated that the cost of a home rose 8.6 per cent in the 12 months to the end of November, down from a 9.7 per cent increase in the year to October. The property industry here is still predicting positive growth in prices in 2023. Gareth McKeown, head of valuations at Geowox, said the resilience of the Irish housing market was “set to be tested” further this year. “Price growth may well be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times’ income,” he said. “Worrying trends” had also been observed in the construction sector, Mr McKeown said, with recent data indicating a slowdown in the rate of output. While it is clear that house price growth continued to cool in the fourth quarter, he said: “It remains to be seen how much of this is seasonal, and how much is fundamental. This will become clearer in the busy spring selling season.”',\n",

       "  'title': '‘All he did was put up those bleeding posters’ - Dublin inner city laments departure of Michael Stone',\n",
       "  'text': 'Paddy Murdiff, a long-time community activist in Dublin’s north inner city, lists off the projects that businessman Michael Stone oversaw during his five years chairing a State-backed board. “Mick Stone is probably the best person to happen to this community. He was very effective. It is a big loss for us,” said Murdiff of the businessman’s work in the inner city. Others connected with Dublin North East Inner City (NEIC) programme and have knowledge of Stone’s chairmanship of the implementation board agree, even after his resignation this week. The founder of multinational engineering business, The Designer Group, resigned from the NEIC implementation board and the board of the Land Development Agency (LDA). He did so after admitting to inadvertently misleading Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe over undisclosed help he gave putting up election posters for the 2020 general election. “Mick didn’t waste time. He was there to get a job done and everything he did was for the interest of the area,” said another local activist. “I deal with people all the time who talk about philanthropy. He put his time where his mouth was.” [ Profile: Michael Stone, the private man behind the public headlines ] For Murdiff, the one that stands out was the renovation of Lourdes Day Care Centre on Sean McDermott Street which provides a place for older people to meet and enjoy a hot meal. It was one of the first places that Stone visited after he became chairman of the implementation board set up in 2016 at the initiative of the then taoiseach Enda Kenny. The then Fine Gael leader had attended the funeral of a local man mistakenly murdered during a gangland feud and was profoundly affected by the tragic scenes he witnessed after the killing. The inner city regeneration effort worked over recent years because of Stone’s drive, the backing of Donohoe, a TD for the area and a Government Minister, and Martin Fraser, who was, until last year, the State’s top civil servant. Since 2016, the Government has invested more than €38 million through the NEIC to improve the lives of people living and working in the district. In Government circles, Stone is remembered for breaking down barriers to get things done. “Most of the things that you will see in the NEIC annual reports are down to Mick. He was the main fellah driving this. It wouldn’t have happened without him,” said one source. In the controversy over Donohoe’s election posters, Stone is said to be “bewildered” with all the media attention. He has been the biggest casualty of the affair, one lamented by those who worked closely with him. As they view it, he was a successful experienced businessman giving time freely and free of charge to two important State agencies tackling two huge problems in Irish society: poverty and housing. His resignation from the boards have left some concerned at the “chill effect” this might have on others, discouraging successful, private individuals from volunteering in public service. “If we had a few more Michael Stones who came out and gave back to their areas, I would be delighted,” said Fine Gael TD Michael Ring, a former minister for community development. “We need business people getting involved in politics, in social life, in disadvantaged areas. We need their advice and their expertise, and you need a different voice than civil servants. We need business people in this country to create jobs. Business is not a bad word,” he said. At the LDA, people valued Stone’s considerable experience in the area of engineering and construction when it came to the agency’s big housing projects. “He was providing an insight into the construction industry that very few people who serve on boards are willing or able to do,” said one source. The source said that on occasions when the LDA was engaging construction companies, Stone absented his company from the procurement process to avoid any appearance of impropriety. “He is very scrupulous about avoiding any conflict of interest,” said the source. I think he [Michael Stone] was one in a million. He did what he had to do and he was genuinely for the area, and that was the big part of it— Paddy Murdiff, community activist A senior Government official expressed concern that prominent people in the private sector “would run a mile” from high-profile public service roles in light of what has happened to Stone. “This is yet another example of a big witch-hunt around something about nothing,” he said. “It is becoming very dangerous to provide a public service to the best of your ability, even for free. It is a profound public policy problem. There seems to be nothing between zero and public crucifixion,” said the source. [ What does Michael Stone’s apology mean for Paschal Donohoe? ] The NEIC initiative was considered a successful template with talk of it being applied in other deprived parts of Dublin city. The resignation of Stone and the departure of Fraser to the Irish Ambassador’s job in London is viewed as an impediment to the future of the project. “It is very sad and kind of tragic for that area. It is going to be hard to replicate that,” said one former Government official who had first-hand knowledge of how the NEIC worked. Local community activist Murdiff is unsure of who they might find to replace Stone. “It will be detrimental to the area unless they get somebody like him. I think he was one in a million. He did what he had to do and he was genuinely for the area, and that was the big part of it,” he said. To those in working in the inner city, the cost of Stone’s departure to the initiative he chaired far outweighs the mistakes that led to his resignation this week. “All he did was put up those bleeding posters,” said Murdiff.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Many teachers like this one, a male primary teacher working in Limerick, don’t want to go on the record about their own students but many, even at primary level, report hearing about Tate from their students. “I mostly hear students mocking him,” says another teacher in an all-boys secondary, “but I’ve come across the odd boy, often a quiet student, who has been influenced.” Another teacher in a rural mixed school says: “I’ve never heard anything about him directly, but I got a response to a question about a novel that made me suspect that a student had been watching his videos.” Tate’s arrest on charges of rape and human trafficking in Romania was the first time many Irish adults had heard of him, but younger people here are reportedly well-acquainted with the champion kickboxer, entrepreneur, and anti-‘woke’ influencer. In July 2022, he was the most Googled name on the planet and in the virtual world of Tiktok, he is a well-established celebrity, where videos of him have been watched 11.6bn times. Tate describes hitting and choking women online, referring to them as “chicks”, “bitches”, and “hoes”. He has argued that rape victims must “bear responsibility” for their attacks in a clip watched over 2.5m times. The American-born, British citizen fled England in 2017 in the wake of numerous accusations of sexual assault by women there. His move to Romania was a calculated one. “I’m not a rapist… I like the idea of a man being free. In the West any woman can destroy a man for life… In Eastern Europe none of this stuff flies.” He is currently in detention in Romania, suspected of having recruited victims for a criminal online porn scam. Female teachers say some male students use Andrew Tate to intimidate them in the classroom. Students allegedly add the tag “make me a sandwich” to the end of their work, thereby announcing themselves as followers of the influencer. One young female teacher working in Dublin says: “I have one student in particular who idolises Tate. He brings him up all the time in class, to get a rise out of me, and it’s intimidating in an all-boys school. “I spoke to my boyfriend’s younger brother, who I can chat to on a different level, and he said that Tate is a genius because he says what everyone is afraid to say. “It’s terrifying that Andrew Tate is having this effect on the next generation. It’s happening and it’s not being stopped. “There are newspaper articles, but they’re not being discussed. Any 13-year-old boy in Ireland knows Andrew Tate. That’s a real problem.” Dismissing education Tate does his best to appear legitimate online. His “university”, in its third iteration, now called “Hustler University 3.0” announces itself as “a worldwide community of over 160,000+ active members learning from a select network of experts in freelancing, crypto, investing, and business”. For a $50 monthly membership fee people are offered an opportunity to match the extreme wealth and success of Tate, who claims to be “the smartest person on the fucking planet”. The Guardian reports that members, some as young as 13, are promised £10,000 a month by learning about crypto investing, drop shipping, and persuading other people to join. Tate’s approach is thoroughly and proudly anti-establishment and throughout his online narrative he actively dismisses mainstream education, which, he says, is left-leaning and “woke”. “We grow stronger every day,” he says of his online university, “while traditional education becomes less and less relevant.” Tate argues that men or boys should take control of women and become rich and successful. He presents the West as an emasculating culture in decline. He is clear and specific in his world view explaining to his millions of followers: “Women should clean up. Not only should women clean up, women should clean up unprompted… I pay for things unprompted… my card always works.” Feeding on boys' fears “Ask any class if they have heard of Tate and the majority will have done so,” says civics teacher Edwin Magnier, who works in a mixed Cork secondary school. He is is happy to go on the record to stem Tate’s influence over other young people in Ireland. “My awareness of this kind of threat began with the emergence of the alt-right movement. Boys are often targeted and radicalised online. “I’ve been concerned about it for the last five years and have been actively designing lessons to counteract the world view being taught to our young men.” As Magnier explains, people like Tate attack young minds before they are educated, and often bad-mouthing mainstream educators is part of their ploy. “Anyone with an education will see through it; we need to be very aware of it in the last few years of primary, whenever a child is given access to the internet. “By secondary [level], in my experience, most students laugh at him. He’s a person to ridicule, often used as a meme. It’s the younger or more vulnerable students we need to protect.” Tate often includes sound advice in the midst of his hateful rhetoric, explains Magnier, reminding young people to work hard for success for instance. He presents himself as a mentor and if a child lacks an actual mentor in their life, it can be both powerful and persuasive. “He delegitimises any other adults who might influence their minds in a positive way, like teachers. “This is a man with 17 expensive cars; he is uber rich and so young people see him as successful. His message to them is that you can be successful too if you overcome your ‘wokeness’. He argues that women are suffering in our culture too because they want to be dominated.” A 14-year-old girl brought Tate to Magnier’s attention after boys started to repeat his ideas in school. “His message to young men is that women are property,” says Magnier. “He tells boys and men to convince girls and women in their lives of that too — in order to manipulate them. He feeds on boys’ fears around masculinity and changing gender roles and links it back to his own wealth. “He describes himself as a powerful alpha male who dominates women. He warns his followers against being weak beta males who tend to be unsuccessful. “He tells them their meekness and inability to stand up to women will mean that women will dominate and destroy them. “The man is being accused of rape and human trafficking. He manipulates women to make money and is open about that. He is not a role model.” Ireland’s shortcomings when it comes to sex education are well documented. Spunout, Ireland’s youth information website created by young people, for young people, is concerned about the paucity of relationship education in schools. “The main source of our sex ed comes from social, personal and health education (SPHE). The current system donates just one hour per week to this subject. This is simply too little. “Sex ed is something that is very important for children, particularly in the junior cycle. “They are at an age when they are entering early puberty and without proper education on the subject of sex it can be a confusing time.” Psychotherapist and author Richard Hogan believes education on Tate needs to start at home. “We must talk to our children about his views; we must help children to think their way through his destructive and negative ideas about women and men’s role in society. Parents must help dismantle these views.” Students reportedly tell their teachers that they are fearful of sharing their online experiences with parents. They worry that their parents might curtail their usage in future. “No way would I show my mum what’s coming up on my screen,” one teacher reports hearing from a 12-year-old boy. “She’d take it off me!” In the UK, where Tate is perhaps best known, the education sector is proactive in its approach. Teachers report the serious “hold” he has on students, as is beginning to happen here. Some schools are running whole-school assemblies entirely devoted to Tate and his ideology. Men At Work CIC trains professionals who work with boys and young men to facilitate constructive dialogues with them about being safe. They have visited dozens of schools to date. They specifically address the reality of young boys being groomed and radicalised by people like Tate. Here, Justice Minister Simon Harris had admitted feeling worried about the influence of Tate on boys. “I think it shows what happens when the State doesn’t step up to its responsibilities. I don’t just mean this State, I mean in general… We need to be much better at providing age-appropriate information around sex education, around gender equality, and through the school curriculum.” Harris goes on to mention a “zero-tolerance strategy” in the pipeline for Irish schools. Other commentators argue that Tiktok needs to do far more to protect young users by ensuring all content on the platform is devoid of hateful, harmful messaging.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Ireland’s housing crisis: why doesn’t the State step in and build?',\n",
       "  'text': 'It’s perhaps the most frequently asked question of Ireland’s housing crisis. Why doesn’t the State step in and build? Whether the chronic undersupply or the lack of affordability meet the definition of market failure is immaterial, housing is now a block on the State’s future development. Perhaps the most galling aspect is that we don’t lack the means to address it. The exchequer is awash with tax receipts and there is an abundance of State land, either idle or underused, to be built on. In such circumstances, the Government’s overwhelming reliance on the private sector to deliver housing is difficult to weigh up particularly when the political fallout has been so severe. Some argue that the Government is ideologically wedded to the idea that the market is the most efficient model for dealing with the State’s housing needs and by extension opposed to the type of large-scale social housing projects we’ve had in the past. This neoliberal tendency can be seen in the shift away from building social homes directly in favour of providing rent supports – the so-called shift from bricks to benefits. And by the fact that the social housing which is provided comes – almost entirely – from the private sector. Of the 2,706 new-build social homes delivered up to the end of September last year, 72 per cent were acquired by way of so-called turnkey purchases – where the local authority or approved housing body (AHB) enters into a forward-purchasing arrangement with a private developer – or through the Part V rule, which stipulates developers must set aside a certain portion of their developments for social housing. [ The Irish Times view on the housing crisis ] Others argue that because the majority of voters here are homeowners who benefit from rising house prices, the Government is averse to a major intervention, which might depress prices and displace a significant chunk of private-sector activity. That seems unlikely, however, given the political heat the crisis is generating, And the days of governments benefiting from rising house prices are well gone. Policymakers may get it wrong but to suggest they’re harbouring hidden motives on housing seems overly conspiratorial. There is a simpler explanation, and one that seems to grow like a weed in Irish society: bureaucracy. For all the criticism laid at their door, local authorities here are so tied up in red tape and process when it comes to the provision of housing that purchasing units directly from the private sector has become a more efficient use of resources and time. More than Covid, more than higher construction costs, local councils link the undersupply of social housing to what’s known as the “four-stage process” – the heavily bureaucratic and massively time-consuming process that the Department of Housing and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform makes them go through when they want to build directly. To secure capital funding to build under the Department of Housing’s Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP), councils must first make the business case for the project before securing pre-planning approval. The first two phases are said to be relatively straightforward. However, it’s the next two stages where the problems start. Under the pre-tender design stage – stage three of the process – the local authority’s architects must engage with the Department of Housing’s architects to agree the final design, a back and forward process that can take months. [ More than 45,000 homes stuck in planning system despite housing crisis, consultants say ] When the final design is agreed, the councils, under the final cost-appraisal and procurement stage, must haggle with the department on what they think the tender price should be, mindful of various price caps set by the department, and rather weirdly before actually going out and procuring a builder to do the work. The price they agree with the department may not be the price they can secure in the marketplace. In a period of rapid cost price inflation, this process has become extremely difficult. The department also forces councils to adopt a new procurement process for each project rather than allowing keep a panel of prospective builders on tap through a framework agreement like in other sectors. If the proposed project is a mixed tenure development with affordable and disability-adapted units alongside standard social housing units, there are also different funding streams, each requiring their own four-stage process that must be navigated in parallel. All in, the pre-construction process is meant to take 52 weeks (with an additional one to two years for construction). In reality, it takes two or three years before a brick is even laid on the ground. Central government imposes these cost-control strictures. [ Government beats housing target but what difference does it make? ] But they are so rigorous that councils say they are effectively disincentivised to build, an irony given the lack of cost control we’ve seen with some of the bigger capital projects like the children’s hospital. Either way, a great public-sector housing build, something that is badly needed and something that could ease pressure right through the system, evades us. Last year’s social housing delivery target was meant to 9,000 units, it’s likely to be 6,500-7,500. In 1975, the then government, with a fraction of the financial resources of the current one, built 8,800 social homes, a record that is still to be eclipsed despite the severity of the current housing crisis.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Business group Ibec warns housing crisis is 'critical barrier to growth and business investment'\",\n",
       "  'text': 'BUSINESS GROUP IBEC has warned that the housing crisis is a critical barrier to continued growth and business investment. Ibec, a group that represents Irish businesses, has today launched a new housing report as part of its “Better Lives, Better Business” campaign. The group has called on the government to urgently deliver “a suite of ambitious policies to speed up the delivery of much-needed housing, and improve viability and affordability”. It has also issued some “key recommendations” which the group claims would “cut the cost of new home by €30,000”. ‘Challenge to business operations’ In a recent Ibec CEO survey, over 70% of companies identified housing availability for staff as a challenge to their business operations in the year ahead. However, 30% deemed this to be a “major challenge” while more than a quarter of businesses said the impact of housing availability on employees was one of the top three external priorities for their business. Ibec’s director of lobbying and influence Fergal O’Brien said: “An inadequate supply of affordable housing is the single largest impediment to attracting and retaining talented workers, without whom business investment and expansions are not possible.” He added: “The housing crisis has increasingly become a concern in relation to cohesion in the workplace and society more broadly. Younger workers, in particular, are financially pressed by ever-higher rents and the receding prospect of homeownership. “This ultimately spills over into issues around well-being and productivity in the workplace, while in the longer-term, if left unchecked, will also create emerging challenges in terms of pension adequacy and people’s broader stake in society over the coming decades.” O’Brien said that from “an employer perspective” there is a need to “reinvigorate the policy drive around the availability and affordability of housing”. He said this will include “reform of the planning and procurement system to speed delivery, a ramping up of ambition in affordable and cost-rental housing, and significant investment in skills and modern methods of construction”. O’Brien claimed that Ibec’s proposed fiscal measures would “reduce the cost of a typical €400,000 new home by €30,000 and this could be achieved with immediate effect”. ‘Key recommendations’ Some of Ibec’s key recommendations to address the housing crisis includes investment in Further Education to address skills shortages and “improved tax treatment of landlords’ expenses”. Ibec said “improved tax treatment of landlords’ expenses” could be achieved “while also ensuring greater security for tenants”. This would be done through “greater resourcing for local authorities and the Residential Tenancies Board to meet a 25% annual rental inspection target, a deposit protection scheme, and a national car testing equivalent scheme for the accommodation rental sector”. Ibec’s report also calls for local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to aim for the delivery of 20,000 social, cost-rental and affordable units annually by the end of the decade. The business group also included as a key recommendation the temporary introduction of a VAT refund order worth 5% of a new home for buyers of new build homes to offset rising costs of construction, as well as greater collaboration with manufacturers and the construction sector. Ibec is also seeking resources to recruit and retain staff to reduce planning backlogs and improve timeliness and to “significantly increase funding through the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) to ensure adequate development finance in the market”.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Credit Demand Survey April 2022 – September 2022  - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Department of Finance has today published the latest in its series on SME Credit Demand Surveys which covers the period April 2022– September 2022. This survey series is currently being conducted by Behaviour and Attitudes, on behalf of the Department of Finance. It is the most comprehensive survey of SME Credit Demand in Ireland, covering over 1,500 respondents through in-depth discussions. The survey captures a full picture of the SME landscape in Ireland, with micro-enterprises, small-sized enterprises and medium-sized enterprises accurately represented as per the percentage make-up of SMEs in Ireland. The survey is conducted biannually. Throughout the report, the most recent wave of findings (referred to as September 2022) is compared with corresponding waves. This ensures that historical comparisons are being made on a like-for-like basis, taking any seasonal issues into account. Key results include: The number of SMEs that applied for bank credit was 17%. A total of 5% of SMEs applied for non-bank finance.SMEs reported that sufficient internal funds was the reason for not seeking credit for 79% of firms.Of all businesses surveyed, 44% reported increased turnover in the six months up to September 2022, with 24% reporting a decrease. The biggest improvement was seen for the hotel and restaurant sector (78%). During the six months up to and including September 2022,65% of SMEs reported profit compared to 57% in 2021. In 2022, 12% reported a loss while 22% broke even. The average value of a credit application for new finance was €278,915, up notably from €208,469 in September 2021. The average value of applications for renewal/restructuring of existing finance has fallen to €396,419.61% of SMEs increased prices, 96% of which have done so to cover increased input costs.For 34% of SMEs, electricity costs are less than 21% of total energy costs. This is down from 42% on the previous wave. However, for 41% of SMEs, electricity costs are more than 60% of total energy costs. This is up from 32% on the previous wave of the survey. The average Irish SME had outstanding debt of just over €427,000, up from €400,000 on the previous wave.More than half (55%) of all SME outstanding debt was to retail banks, with the balance owed to non-bank bodies. This is down just 1% on the previous wave.Overall 40% of SMEs have no debt with construction and business services having the lowest level of debt. On the publication of the SME Credit Demand Survey Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath T.D. stated: “I welcome the results of the latest wave of the SME Credit Demand Survey. It enables Government to gain a critical understanding of the Irish SME landscape. This in turn enables Government to develop, refine and implement policy measures to support SMEs that are critical to Ireland’s economic performance and an important source of employment across the country. For example, the survey series has provided an evidence base to help inform Government’s response in supporting SMEs facing rising energy costs and the cost of doing business via the launch of the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme (TBESS) and the forthcoming launch of the Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme (UCGS) and the Growth and Sustainability Loan Scheme (GSLS). I would like to thank the businesses that partook in this survey wave”. Ends Note for Editors: Background of Report The SME Credit Demand Survey has been conducted biannually since 2011 to monitor trends in access to credit by SMEs. Please note while the survey is conducted on a 6 monthly basis, for presentation purposes, the report uses year-on-year comparisons. The report published today presents the results from the SME Credit Demand Survey April 2022 – September 2022. Conducted by Behaviour and Attitudes, all interviews were conducted between the 11th October and 1st December 2022 and covered the period from April 2022 to September 2022. The Department has conducted the SME Credit Demand Survey in order to have an independent and statistically significant report into the Irish SME landscape and the availability of, and demand for, credit that exists for SMEs. The survey was conducted through a telephone survey covering over 1,500 businesses. It drew a carefully constructed sample from a large database of SMEs, made repeated calls to ensure a full response and asked factual questions. The full questionnaire is included in the report. The report and previous reports are available on the Department of Finance website at https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/788135-credit-demand-surveys/. The results will be used to monitor the sector, identify any changes or emerging trends and to feed into the development of policy options with colleagues in other Government Departments including Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture Food and the Marine for Government to consider. Summary and key findings This report contains the results of the Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey. All interviews were conducted between the 11th October and 1st December 2022 and covered the period from April 2022 to September 2022. Throughout the report, the most recent wave of findings (referred to as September 2022) is compared with corresponding waves. This ensures that historical comparisons are being made on a like-for-like basis, taking any seasonal issues into account. Please note that due to Covid-19 restrictions, no interviewing was possible for the same period in 2020. Demand for Bank Finance: 17% of SMEs applied for bank finance in the 6 months to September 2022. Credit demand remained unchanged in the six months to September 2022, with 17% of SMEs reported that they applied for bank finance. When this is broken down by firm size, credit demand has increased slightly among micro companies (+1%) and decreased among medium sized companies (-3%). However medium sized companies continue to have the highest level of credit demand at 22%.17% of all SMEs expected to apply for finance in the following six months, up significantly from 7% in September 2021.The main reason stated for not seeking credit in the past six months was that the company had sufficient internal, a reason cited by 79% of business not seeking credit (up from 76% in September 2021). New loans, and leasing or hire purchase were the main finance products requested by SMEs, followed by new overdrafts.Credit demand was highest for the Construction (20%), Wholesale (17%) and Business Services (17%), while lowest for Hotels & Restaurants (13%) and Manufacturing (12%).The average reported cost of credit on outstanding loans was 5.13% – an increase from 4.59% reported in September 2021. 2% of SMEs reported having missed repayments of bank loans in the period – down from 5% in September 2021.5% of SMEs requested traditional finance (e.g. leasing or hire purchase, or new loan) from a non-bank provider in the six months up to September 2022. The most common type of non-bank finance requested was leasing and hire purchase (24%), followed by new loan (20%). The Application Process Of those companies that requested bank finance, working capital (41%) and business expansion (35%) were cited as the main reasons for making a finance request, followed by investment in machinery or equipment (17%). Compared to September, bank finance requests were down for business expansion, while up for working capital.The average value of a credit application for new finance was €278,915, up from €208,469 in September 2021. The average value of applications for renewal/restructuring of existing finance was €396,419, up notably from September 2021.Of those applying for bank finance, 27% had to provide some type of collateral (down from 42% in September 2021), with the main collateral types required being buildings and personal assets. The average value of collateral required as a percentage of the loan was 53%.60% of all finance applications were processed within the stipulated 15 working days of receipt of all information from the company. The average amount of time from application to decision was 26 working days. The proportion of loans that were still pending stood at 9%. The proportion of credit applications declined stood at 10% in September 2022, largely in line with the 9% reported September 2021. But the proportion of requests that was approved fully was down from 86% in 2021 to 83% in 2022. Decline rates were lowest for the Business Services sector at 5%, with the highest decline rates seen for Hotels & Restaurants (17%).In September 2022, 22% of SMEs that were refused credit reported that they were informed of their right to an internal review – down from 42% in September 2021, with a large proportion (38%) unable to recall whether they were informed of their right to an internal review. Just 26% of those who were refused credit reported that they were informed of their right to a review by the Credit Review Office, with 41% were unsure if they were informed or not. It should be noted these calculations are based on a very small base size of just 29 respondents. SME Supports and Initiatives A large majority of SMEs are aware of Enterprise Ireland (90%), Local Enterprise Offices (80%), and the Credit Guarantee Scheme (63%). 44% were aware of the Credit Review Office, and 52% were aware of Microfinance Ireland Supports. Just 5% were not aware of any government support.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Generation II images tease the designs produced in collaboration with EDAG Group Known for its top-level development of concept cars, prototypes and expertise in the international automotive industry, global mobility engineers EDAG was appointed by First Hydrogen in 2022 to develop design and styling for its zero emission light commercial vehicles (LCV). These first released images show the next generation’s front and rear detail. The front view features a smart digital panel, which shows the configuration of daytime running lights (DRL) designed to give the van a recognisable face and identity, as well as outstanding visibility. The rear elevation reveals vertical tail lights either side of the main cargo access point. The design follows function as it accommodates different types of doors including tailgates, barn doors and roller shutters. First Hydrogen briefed EDAG Group to assist it in the development of designs for large panel vans that can be scaled to different vehicle heights and lengths. The result will be modular vehicles that allow for customisation to suit operational use and can be employed for a wide range of applications including express delivery, grocery, construction and utilities work, emergency services and vehicle recovery. First Hydrogen revealed its Generation I fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) last year, which are now undergoing mileage accumulation and testing before commencing operational trials. From March 2023, the vans will be placed with fleet operators from the UK Aggregated Hydrogen Freight Consortium (AHFC), which include national supermarkets, utilities providers, roadside assistance and healthcare services. These real-world on road trials will enable operators to experience hydrogen transport solutions first-hand and help First Hydrogen engage with potential future customers and provide data to inform the development and production of its future vehicles. The global light commercial vehicle market size was valued at USD 480.52 billion in 2021. It is projected to reach USD 751.86 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.1% during the forecast period (2022-2030). FCEVs offer operational benefits for the zero-emission commercial van market and LCV sector with faster refuelling speeds, longer range, and larger payload, auxiliary load and towing capabilities. The First Hydrogen Generation II design will reflect this operational flexibility, ultimately supporting the Company to become leaders in efficiency and progress for zero emissions vehicles. Steve Gill, CEO of Automotive for First Hydrogen, says: “We’re thrilled to reveal this preview of our next generation of zero emission vehicles. Following the success of our Generation I demonstrator vans that prove our concept and technology capabilities, with this next series of vehicles, our goal is to provide the commercial van market with a complete solution for operational flexibility. This sneak preview indicates the careful consideration that has gone into combining aesthetics with engineering excellence; the vehicle configuration and signature light panels show a solid standout design that is iconic and will be a real head turner.” Bernat Costa, Design Director at EDAG Spain, comments: “The pure design of the light panels complements the vehicle’s functional purpose, establishing a First Hydrogen design signature and illuminating the van to improve its visibility for other road users in city and urban landscapes. This is especially important for delivery and roadside assistance vehicles, which need to make regular stops. The clean aesthetic also reflects the vehicles’ zero emissions status. We can’t wait to reveal more of the design as we progress on the project.” Further details on First Hydrogen’s next generation of green hydrogen vans will follow.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Councils seek €40 million to help beef up staffing in planning departments nationwide',\n",
       "  'text': \"COUNTY AND CITY councils have sought an additional €40 million from the Government for their planning departments, with requests for resources to beef up their staff by more than a third. Findings from a Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) report show that local authorities have asked for an extra 541 planning staff as of Q2 2022. A snapshot of this report – provided to TDs on the Oireachtas Housing Committee – says that, as of Q2 2022, there are 1,550 staff across planning departments in all councils. If provided, this would boost the total number of planning department staff across all councils to 2,091. According to the briefing note from the Department of Housing, 217 of the additional posts sought are within the planning policy area, while 212 are within development management. The remaining 112 posts are within the planning enforcement sector. The total cost of the 541 posts sought by councils is approximately €40 million, however the Government has only allocated €5 million to hiring additional planning staff. This would only add approximately 68 additional staff to planning departments nationwide. Social Democrats’ Housing Spokesperson Cian O’Callaghan said that this funding from the Government represented a “tokenistic approach” and that planning departments within local authorities are under-resourced. Leah Farrell Social Democrats' Housing Spokesperson Cian O'Callaghan Leah Farrell “Given the scale of the housing crisis we have and actually the huge deficit in terms of the provision of infrastructure alongside housing, it doesn’t make sense to be under resourcing housing,” O’Callaghan told The Journal. “If we want to get more delivery of housing and more delivery of infrastructure then resourcing planning, including forward planning, that’s an important part of it. “It’s a tokenistic approach really from the Government on this.” Sinn Féin’s Housing Spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin said that he wanted to see a “multi-annual” funding plan to help increase staffing levels across all local authority departments. “I think what we need is a plan. What I’d like to see is the Minister [Darragh O'Brien] and the LGMA engage with the Oireachtas Committee and work out what that plan is in terms of how much staff do they need when and how quickly they can be recruited,” Ó Broin said. He said that key aspects of planning policy come through both local development plans and local area plans, but that at present, councils do not have enough resources. “You’re not getting the kind of joined up infrastructure going with housing, so it’s very important that the area is properly resourced. Without that, we’re not going to get the kind of delivery, both of housing and the facilities we need with it.” There were initially cuts to staffing at planning departments nationwide following the 2008 financial crisis, with the Department estimating that 30% of staff were cut. Ó Broin told The Journal that local authorities have still not recovered their staffing levels following the crash. “Local authorities have never recovered back to their pre-2008 crash staffing levels. RollingNews.ie Sinn Féin's Housing Spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin RollingNews.ie “The local government lost 25% of its employees as a consequence of the austerity budgets post-2008, the single largest percentage loss across the public sector. “It doesn’t surprise me that the local authority managers are saying that their need for staff is far greater than what the Government has budgeted for.” The Department says that alongside recruitment of new staff, there will be a “concerted focus on upskilling, training and education”, with the Office of the Planning Regulator finalising a new training plan for councils. “Further work is underway to examine how the broader funding of the planning system and the need for greater cost recovery to ensure that funding is sustainable into the future,” the briefing note reads. Planning ‘logjam’ The briefing document comes days after a construction report showed that there is a significant “logjam” at An Bord Pleanála (ABP), with 59% Strategic Housing Development (SHD) applications in 2022 being stalled. The Mitchell McDermott Annual Construction Sector Report 2023 says that 28,786 units of housing remain undecided upon by ABP, with the delay being labelled as “unacceptable”. “Everyone knows the Board has had its issues this year but to have so many units delayed amid a housing crisis is unacceptable,” said Paul Mitchell, one of the report’s authors. “You would imagine this backlog could easily be addressed by drafting in additional temporary resources from private practice here or from the UK and we believe this should be done straight away.” SHDs have since been replaced with Large Scale Residential Developments (LRDs), which are applied for at the council level rather than directly to ABP. Concerns about the level of staffing within planning departments come as the Government last week published the Planning and Development Bill 2023, which is set to overhaul the current planning system. Under the bill, there will be a renewed focus on Local Development Plans, including extending their lifespan to ten-years.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"“I’ve seen the catastrophic effects of alcohol,” he said, outlining his experience as a liver specialist, and said that reducing the availability of alcohol is a “constructive way” of reducing harms. Sinn Féin Senator Fintan Warfield said that the measures contained in the proposed Sale of Alcohol Bill don’t simply come down to “industry vs public health”, and there are other stakeholders involved. “We’ve lost 85% of nightclubs in the last 20 years,” he said. “Hundreds of people are calling for change on this issue. Without extended hours, we’re going to lose those spaces for good.” The Government's legislation aims to revamp the country's patchwork of laws governing alcohol sales in pubs, restaurants and off-licences, some of which date back more than 200 years. Alcohol licences will be allowed for museums and galleries, while pubs will be permitted to stay open for longer until 12.30am, along with extended hours for nightclubs. The legislation has been welcomed in many quarters, including the pub and nightclub trade, and the Justice Minister has said it would help sectors “decimated” during the pandemic, and aim to diversify the night-time offerings in our towns and cities. However, there are facets to which they have taken exception or have sought clarity on. Publicans have said the removal of the extinguishment provision, whereby a new operator cannot enter the pub trade without first acquiring an existing licence, would have a damaging effect on rural pubs in particular. However, advocacy groups as well as doctors and psychiatrists have warned of the health risks of extending access to alcohol and the impact it could have on the health service and on crime. Speaking before the committee on Tuesday was the National Transport Authority, the Institute of Public Health, Mandate trade union, Alcohol Action Ireland and the Irish Community Action on Alcohol Network. The Institute of Public Health’s Ciara Reynolds said that systematic reviews of licensing hours internationally had found that “extending opening hours by even one hour increased injuries, assaults, drink-driving, car crashes and driving injuries”.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'McBurney Transport invests in 30 new trailers from SDC Ballymena based logistics company McBurney Transport is in the news again after taking delivery of 30 new Aluminium Boxvan trailers from manufacturer SDC Trailers in Toomebridge. The substantial investment signals a dedication by the company to strengthen its efficiency and operations for customers across the UK, Ireland, and Europe. Built to withstand the rigours of the road, McBurney’s new Boxvan’s feature three BPW Eco Air axles with low maintenance drum brakes and a roll stability braking system, along with internal load restraint rails, steel reinforced flooring, LED and ISO regulation lighting. The trailers are manufactured to SDC’s lightweight and durable design with a double-skin allow plank body and double-insulated roof, providing additional security and insulation of goods during transport. “We are very pleased with the new trailers from SDC Trailers,” said Norman McBurney founder McBurney Transport, “The advanced features and high-quality construction will help us to improve our operational efficiency and better serve our customers. The Boxvan trailers will join our modern fleet of over 1,300 trailers.“ Norman confirmed the recent announcement that Danish shipping and logistics company, DFDS will acquire the family-owned McBurney Transport Group in a move that will expand its network by joining one of the largest global groups in the sector. The acquisition is aligned with DFDS’ strategy of growing solutions within cold chain logistics. Headquartered in Copenhagen, DFDS operates on thirty routes, employing 11,000 staff in twenty countries connected by their ferry and logistics services. SDC’s Ireland Sales Manager, Jimmy McKernan said: “We would like to wish Norman, his wife Lynn, and the rest of the team best wishes for the future. They are a long-valued customer of SDC and it has been a pleasure to work together and support McBurney Transport over the years. McBurney’s latest order of 30 new Boxvan trailers are built to the highest standards of quality and durability, and I am confident they will serve McBurney Transport for many years to come.” Founded in 1965, McBurney Transport operates from eight locations, three in Northern Ireland, one in Ireland, three in England, and one in Scotland. Their customers range from multinational blue-chip corporations to local companies, major supermarkets, food and drink manufacturers, high street retailers as well as companies in the construction, horticulture, and industrial sectors. In Liverpool, McBurney operates a 25,000-pallet cold store, which facilitates the transport of cold chain goods throughout the UK.',\n",

       "  'title': '‘Not possible’ to make Northern Ireland Protocol work - EU law expert',\n",
       "  'text': 'A senior barrister has told a Westminster committee the Northern Ireland protocol is a question of “identity” and he does not believe it is possible to make it work. Responding to a question from the Conservative MP David Jones, Thomas Sharpe KC – an expert on EU law and a Conservative Party member – said there was a “sort of a commercial logic” to making it function for the business community in Northern Ireland. Asked specifically if it could work given its “democratic deficiency”, Mr Sharpe replied: “No, I don’t. It is a fundamental issue, who governs people in Northern Ireland. “It should be Stormont, it should be the UK parliament,” he said, agreeing the same principle should apply regarding the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the protocol. He was also asked about the role of the ECJ by the DUP MP Gavin Robinson and answered that it was “a question of identity. You just don’t want, any more than we do in GB, to have the European court telling us what the law ought to be.” A report in The Times on Wednesday suggested the EU and UK had struck a customs deal which could pave the way for a resolution of the issues around the Northern Ireland protocol, though this was subsequently dismissed by the Irish and UK governments who said no deal had been agreed. Commenting on the report, the committee chair, the Conservative MP William Cash, said there “might have been a bit of exaggeration here” and added that the members of the Committee “haven’t seen anything to scrutinise, which is the crucial issue”. Citing government sources, The Times also reported that Brussels has made concessions of the jurisdiction of the ECJ, a key sticking point in UK-EU talks. For the first time, it recognised that the ECJ could rule on Northern Ireland issues only if a case was referred by courts there, the newspaper said. Mr Robinson asked if, in Mr Sharpe’s opinion, there was a “construct which would remove ECJ whilst EU law applies to Northern Ireland or do you think, in totality, if you can be free from that legislative framework by consequence you remove ECJ”. Mr Sharpe said that “if you believe, absolutely fundamentally, whatever law you’re seeking to apply, EU or any other law, nevertheless, the Northern Ireland courts are perfectly capable of dealing with that, then you absolutely can take away the Court of Justice jurisdiction.” However, he also acknowledged it could prove legally difficulty to do so, adding that “it seems to me if you want to get rid of the Court of Justice you’ve got to get rid of the super structure of it [the protocol]”. Mr Sharpe was giving evidence on Wednesday to the European Scrutiny Committee, which is examining the UK government’s proposals to amend the Northern Ireland Protocol and the real world impacts they could have on businesses. Addressing the Committee earlier, Stuart Anderson, the Head of Public Affairs at the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the businesses had “seen the protocol impact in really significant ways, both positively, negatively and not at all, depending on the sector, the structure of supply chains and the historical nature of the business”. He said the body’s quarterly economic survey had demonstrated “quite a positive upward trend” over the last year, but added that investment was being “withheld” by some firms in Northern Ireland due to uncertainty. Fergus McReynolds, the Director of EU and International Affairs at manufacturing body Make UK, said it was “clear” that “co-operation with the EU is being held back while we are at an impasse” over the protocol and “we really need to start talking and co-operating with each other in a way that is being hampered at the moment”.

       "  'title': 'Engineers Ireland forecasts almost 8,000 sectoral jobs for 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Engineers Ireland’s latest employers’ survey, the first since the pandemic, has shown that a shortage of experienced engineers and the housing crisis are among the many barriers experienced by engineering employers undertaking recruitment for 2023. Damien Owens, Director General, Engineers Ireland, said: “Our recent survey has shown that 72% of member-respondents are majorly concerned about the shortage of engineers with the correct skills. These engineering employers see this shortage as the main barrier to business growth. We are all aware of the recent job cuts in the tech sector – many of them in the engineering area. It is important to stress that there are other sectors which are in urgent need of engineers e.g., construction and consultancy, with almost 8,000 new jobs anticipated in these sectors in 2023. “The engineering field is one of the most important in our society. Engineering touches the lives of everyone, providing creative solutions to societal needs from tangible works such as bridges and flood defences, to heart stents and prostheses as well as the invisible technology that is all around us. But there is a problem: there are not enough skilled engineers to meet demand. The skills shortage is nothing new. In fact, it has been an issue for years. To try and retain or seek talent, companies are upskilling, maintaining hybrid working, where possible and attracting talent from overseas.” The professional body for engineers has also warned that the shortage of engineers could potentially undermine the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 goals and ambitions. Project Ireland 2040 is made up of the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan 2021-2030. “In Project Ireland 2040, the Government has committed to actions on climate change and a ready supply of talented engineers will be fundamental to realising these goals. In 2023, the reality is that the number of students moving into third-level engineering and the technology sectors needs to be much larger to meet employers’ future needs for graduates. “If we don’t address the skills shortage soon, it could have negative effects on our economy and society. We urgently need more young people choosing careers in engineering. I would therefore strongly encourage students making their CAO choices, and particularly young women, to consider a career in engineering and the fantastic and expanding opportunities that exist in the sector,” Mr Owens continued. This call to action has come in advance of the CAO deadline of Wednesday, 1 February, which marks the application closing date for undergraduate courses. Damien Owens also said that an engineering apprenticeship, with many offering an ‘earn and learn’ experience, is an exciting opportunity for Leaving Certificate students who have an interest in engineering as a career, adding that: “An engineering apprenticeship can also be a proven way for employers to develop talent for their company, as well as opening up new and rewarding careers, with learning grounded in practical experience.” In addition to encouraging Leaving Certificate students to consider a career in engineering, Engineers Ireland is also calling on engineering firms, companies big and small, libraries, local authorities, schools, and third-level institutions nationwide to get involved in STEPS Engineers Week 2023. Taking place from 4-10 March 2023, STEPS Engineers Week provides primary and secondary school students with the opportunity to discover engineering through events and activities facilitated by their teachers, parents, and local community. The week-long celebration of the engineering profession is coordinated by Engineers Ireland’s STEPS programme – a non-profit outreach programme that promotes interest and awareness in engineering to school students – and is funded by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and industry leaders Arup, the EPA, ESB, Intel and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Irish economy has motored through a series of global crises – Brexit, the pandemic, soaring inflation – proving itself more resilient than anyone, even policymakers, could have predicted. It would be ironic, then, if it foundered on the domestic issue of housing. The sharp bounceback in activity since Covid appears to have brought matters to a head, with companies saying they are unable to expand, take on new orders or hire staff because of the lack of rental accommodation and the constraint that this puts on their business. Business leaders claim we have reached a tipping point on the issue, and that unless something is done to improve availability and affordability, Ireland’s jobs-rich growth model will stall. In a report this week, employers’ group Ibec said the shortage of housing had become a “critical barrier to continued growth and development” in the economy. An inadequate supply of affordable housing, it said, “was the single largest impediment to attracting and retaining talented workers, without whom business investment and expansions are not possible”. Padraig O’Neill, the managing director of Unum’s Technology Centre in Carlow town, a tech campus for US insurance giant Unum, says there are second-hand properties to buy in Carlow town and the surrounding area but there is little or no available rental property. At best, there are two to three properties available on property website Daft on any given day, he says. “The majority of the people we’re hiring are in the younger age bracket so they’re looking to rent not buy,” O’Neill says. “The culture of the company – being around experienced people, being able to learn – is being hindered because so many face long commutes or have to work remotely.” Unum currently employs about 230 staff, doubling its workforce during the pandemic, and offers flexible working. “We recruit a lot from surrounding colleges in Maynooth, Waterford and Carlow,” he says, noting that those from Maynooth and Waterford struggle to get accommodation locally. “We’re trying to build a brand in those colleges – one that suggests Unum Technology in Carlow is a great place to go for your internship [the company converts about 80 per cent of its interns into full-time employees] – but if it involves a two-hour commute, then that can really dampen the overall experience.” The exodus of smaller landlords from the market – a key factor driving the current undersupply of rental property – is particularly evident in Carlow, according to O’Neill. In a recent report, Daft said there were just 1,087 homes available to rent nationally on its website as of November 1st last, down about 25 per cent on the same date last year, and just 345 in Dublin. According to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI), about 40 per cent of property sales in the final three months of last year involved landlords selling their investment properties. The SCSI linked the exodus to “overly complex” rent legislation, low rental returns, and compliance with “onerous” housing standards. John O’Flynn, general manager of the five-star Fota Island Resort in east Cork, says the biggest challenge for the business is the rental market. “Typically at this time of the year, we would be going out to the different culinary colleges in Europe to bring in chefs for summer placements, but we just cannot secure a short-term rental or a long-term rental of any description,” he says. Whether employees can get accommodation in the local area has become a bigger issue for them than salaries and there is now an onus on the employer to provide the accommodation, O’Flynn says. While the hotel provides a certain cohort of staff with accommodation, the business has long since exhausted this option. O’Flynn says the big upturn in economic activity since Covid has generated an unrealisable demand for rental property. Demand in the hospitality industry (for leisure holidays, weekend breaks, corporate events) has never been as strong, he adds, but housing has “become a real barrier for us”. [ Merrion Hotel looks to provide staff accommodation close to five-star property ] He also highlighted a new phenomenon, with some construction companies working in the Cork area now using the Fota resort to house staff on a temporary basis for the duration of a project – and paying a premium to do so. “We wouldn’t have seen this type of business before,” O’Flynn says. From an employer perspective, there is a need to reinvigorate the policy drive around the availability and affordability of housing— Fergal O'Brien Ibec’s “Better Housing, Better Business” report, published on Monday, said the State’s housing crisis had increasingly become a concern in relation to cohesion in the workplace and society more broadly. “Younger workers, in particular, are financially pressed by ever-higher rents and the receding prospect of homeownership. This ultimately spills over into issues around well-being and productivity in the workplace,” it said. “Ibec members have detailed struggles to us when trying to fill key roles due to a lack of adequate affordable accommodation,” the organisation said. It called on the Government to urgently deliver policies to speed up the delivery of housing and to improve viability and affordability, including a temporary VAT refund to offset rising construction costs; and the introduction of a State fund, set up with proceeds from the Local Property Tax, to subvent the cost of levies for new homes. Ibec says up to 20,000 social, cost-rental and affordable homes should be provided each year. While new home completions rose to almost 30,000 last year, exceeding the Government’s 24,600 target, the 9,000 social affordable housing targets won’t be met. Unpublished research by the Housing Commission also suggests that the State may need up to 62,000 homes built per year until 2050 to meet demand – almost double the annual target of 33,000 contained in the Government’s Housing for All plan. Ibec urged the Government to progress its new Planning and Development Bill, which aims to overhaul planning here, amid complaints from industry that the system is entirely under-resourced and too slow. “From an employer perspective, there is a need to reinvigorate the policy drive around the availability and affordability of housing,” Ibec’s director of lobbying and influence Fergal O’Brien said. Ireland is not unique in facing a housing crisis. However, as a small, globalised economy, the availability of accommodation is an important economic enabler— AmCham chief executive Mark Redmon “This will require a suite of measures to improve the viability and affordability of homebuilding, such as addressing emerging financing deficits, reform of the planning and procurement system to speed delivery, a ramping up of ambition in affordable and cost-rental housing, and significant investment in skills and modern methods of construction,” Mr O’Brien said. Patrick Mulholland, managing director of medical devices company VistaMed, which is based in Carrick-on-Shannon in Co Leitrim, says it’s not the cost but the availability of housing that is proving the biggest headache for the company. The lack of supply is a constraint on growth, he says. The company has had to take a much more active role in securing accommodation for workers, including providing financial guarantees to landlords. VistaMed, which already employs 670 staff, is planning to recruit an additional 50 people over the next 10 months but that’s likely to prove difficult in the current climate, Mulholland says, Beyond that point, he believes housing will limit the company’s expansion. “I simply can’t see us going beyond 750 unless there’s a major shift in housing availability,” he says. “Housing will limit what business we can take on going forward. That’s the bottom line. As a global company, we would look for other destinations – other than Ireland – if we’re unable to locate the workforce here.” The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, which represents US business interests here, says it has consistently highlighted the delivery of housing as a key issue when it comes to maintaining current and securing future investment in Ireland. In a recent survey of member companies, 98 per cent said the availability of residential accommodation was important to maintaining FDI (foreign direct investment) employment in Ireland. “Ireland is not unique in facing a housing crisis. However, as a small, globalised economy, the availability of accommodation is an important economic enabler,” AmCham chief executive Mark Redmond says. “AmCham has been consistent in its engagement with Government in recommending a continued focus on enabling the on-time delivery of commitments under the Housing for All plan and the continued prioritisation of planning and capital investment in accommodation provision,” he adds, noting that reform of the planning process is key in supporting the development of housing and business growth. Simon McKeever, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, says: “A significant issue that has come more to the fore over the last number of months amongst Irish Exporters Association members is housing. Inflation and the cost of doing business are already pressing issues, but the acquisition and retention of talent is becoming a concern. “Companies are worried about the lack of housing and the cost of it and the impact this is having on their ability to be able to attract and retain talent, particularly when you get into more rural areas,” he adds. A recurring problem in Ireland has been the stress on infrastructure from a massive expansion of the private sector. Since 2014, the Irish economy has grown by more than 50 per cent, largely as a result of a spike in investment and employment almost exclusively in the private sector. The surge has created more than 400,000 jobs – 25 in the private sector for every one in the public sector – but a myriad of bottlenecks across the economy. Housing is perhaps the most obvious manifestation of this.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris TD has today (3 February 2023) welcomed the official launch of Safe Pass Renewal online. Safe Pass Renewal was announced by Minister Harris in December 2022 in line with Housing for All objectives to reduce barriers to careers in construction. Wednesday marked the launch of the live online renewal system on the SOLAS website. Safe Pass Renewal removes the need to take a full day off work, and significantly reduces waiting times for current card holders. Speaking today, Minister Harris said: “I am delighted that Safe Pass Renewal is officially live and available to current Safe Pass card holders. They now have the opportunity to renew their cards in a quick, efficient and streamlined manner. “This initiative is an important milestone in my Department’s response to Housing for All as it works to remove barriers and increase participation in, and engagement with, our construction sector. “In addition, the cost to renew online is half the cost of an in-person assessment and only takes 45 minutes, meaning our workers won’t miss out on a day’s wages.” Safe Pass Renewal is a self-directed learning model, where candidates can access revision material and undertake the test in a registered and controlled test centre. Safe Pass Renewal assessments will take place in one of 30 approved Pearson VUE exam centres which are located throughout the country. The online renewal costs €93.84 and consists of 50 multiple choice questions to be answered within 45 minutes. Following a review of the Safe Pass Renewal process, the Questions and Answers Booklet fee of €12 has now been waived, furthering the cost-effectiveness of this option to those looking to renew. Card holders can still continue to renew their cards through the existing tutor lead programme delivered in a classroom setting, if they wish to do so. Minister Harris added: “I’d like to reiterate my thanks to all stakeholders who assisted us in developing Safe Pass Renewal and bringing it on stream. SOLAS, CIF Trade Unions and members of the Construction Industry Advisory Group have all been crucial in the development of this initiative.” Andrew Brownlee, CEO of SOLAS, said: I am pleased to welcome this new streamlines system which will benefit and support the broader construction sector and enable a faster, more cost-efficient method to renew Safe Pass cards for all workers in construction. “Safe Pass has been a vital cornerstone in safeguarding the health and safety of our construction sector for many years now. “This important step forward will provide an alternative model that reduces costs, days off site, and time for workers who hold a Safe Pass card. “Lots more information about this new system and Safe Pass itself can be found online as www.solas.ie/safepass.” ENDS',\n",

       "  'text': 'The FTSE 100 fell back from Friday’s record high in a dent for the recent recovery in trading sentiment. Surging US jobs figures from Friday and a hawkish speech by Bank of England rate-setter Catherine Mann indicated that there is still room for further interest rate increases.London stocks slid on Monday as a result, with housebuilders among those falling after PMI construction figures showed the weakest sector performance for almost three years.By the end of the day, London’s top index had declined by 65.09 points, or 0.82%, to 7,836.71p.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: “European markets have taken a step back today as the aftermath of Friday’s bumper US payrolls continues to reverberate through the market.“The FTSE 100, having hit a new record high last week, has slipped back, along with the rest of Europe’s markets, as yields continue to rise, building on the surge we saw on Friday.“External monetary policy committee member Catherine Mann, who is the main hawk on the Bank of England rate-setting committee, has added to the upward pressure on bond yields by saying that rates in the UK will have to continue to rise, and that it is better to lean towards over-tightening than being cautious.”Weakness early doors from the Asian market, particularly among technology and property stocks, leaked immediately into trading sentiment across Europe.The Dax closed down 0.84% and France’s Cac 40 fell by 1.34% by the close.In the US, the main markets picked up where they left off on Friday to drop in the face of rising yields.Meanwhile, sterling hit its lowest against the dollar for a month after the US greenback continued to see the benefits of the bumper payroll report.The pound was down 0.39% against the dollar at 1.200 and was 0.34% higher against the euro at 1.120 at the close.In company news, Superdry moved higher after founder and chief executive Julian Dunkerton upped his stake in the fashion retailer, despite denying reports that he is planning to take the company private just days earlier.The group said Mr Dunkerton has increased his stake in the company to 24.3% from 23.9%. As a result, shares in the business improved by 2.4p to 123.4p.Elsewhere in retail, investors were less positive about Frasers after reports the Sports Direct parent firm could buy two UK shopping centres for around £100 million.The Sunday Times reported that the Mike Ashley-founded operation is in advanced talks to buy The Mall in Luton and is also considering a deal for the Overgate centre in Dundee.Frasers shares moved 9.5p lower to 793.5p on Monday.The price of oil rebounded from its lowest levels in three weeks amid concerns about how the earthquake in Turkey could impact nearby oil terminals.Brent crude oil increased by 0.85% to 80.62 US dollars (£67.14) per barrel when the London markets closed.The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 were Airtel Africa, up 4p at 117.4p, Centrica, up 1.7p at 96.96p, GSK, up 21.4p at 1,461p, Fresnillo, up 10.6p at 827.4p, and National Grid, up 6p at 1,040p.The biggest fallers of the session were Prudential, down 64.5p at 1,289.5p, Ocado Group, down 24.8p at 713.8p, Hargreaves Lansdown, down 31.2p at 918.4p, BT, down 4.3p at 130.35p, and Land Securities, down 20.6p at 721.2p.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The number of job opportunities in Kilkenny will grow by 15% in the coming year, according to a new forecast from FRS Recruitment, one of the country’s leading recruitment agencies. This follows on from the 9% increase experienced in Kilkenny in 2022. While Kilkenny experienced a significant level of growth in 2022, the counties to experience the highest increases included Dublin (up 36%), Clare (up 31%), Wicklow (up 34%), Sligo (up 15%), Cork (up 15%) and Roscommon, which recorded the highest year on year increase with the number of roles more than doubling (up 101%). 18 of the 26 counties in the Republic experienced an increase in openings in 2022. The largest decreases came in Kerry (down 10%), Leitrim, (down 9%) and Louth (down 7%). [articlepreview id=\"1029527\" link=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/sport/1029527/success-at-home-and-abroad-for-kilkenny-athletes.html\"] Nationally the number of job postings handled by FRS Recruitment rose by 32% in 2022, reaching a total of 107,802 – up from 81,528 in 2021. Year on year the monthly increase was across 11 of the 12 months and illustrated the return of the market to post pandemic normality, with the level of jobs aligning with 2019, the last pre Covid year of activity. Despite the surge in opportunities available, the number of people applying for jobs was down last year. FRS Recruitment recorded a total of 123,305 job responses in 2022 as it became a “candidates’ market” in some sectors. This meant the average response rate per role was at 1.14, down from 1.66 in 2021. On a sub sector level the largest increase in roles experienced in 2022 was in Banking & Financial Services, which were up 106%. This was followed by opportunities in IT – Software Development (up 67%) and IT – Support Services (up 46%). Significant growth was also recorded in arts, entertainment and recreation (up 43%), education & training (up 31%) and professional services & practices (up 25%). FRS Recruitment is also forecasting further growth in IT, construction and healthcare recruitment for the year ahead, describing these sectors as “relatively inelastic”. [articlepreview id=\"1028981\" link=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/home/1028981/graignamanagh-named-in-top-ten-most-charming-irish-villages.html\"] The analysis is contained in FRS Recruitment’s ‘2022 Review and 2023 Trend Forecast’ Report. Speaking about the report, Lynne McCormack, General Manager with FRS Recruitment said, “We are confident that we will see further growth in recruitment opportunities in Kilkenny for the year ahead. We experienced a strong year in Kilkenny last year and our belief is that this will continue over the coming 12 months. “Both in Kilkenny and nationally we believe there will be strong opportunities in the IT, healthcare and construction sectors. There has been such a build-up in openings across these sectors over recent years that they have become relatively inelastic and that will continue throughout 2023. Not all parts of the economy will rise in 2023, but we are very optimistic about the prospects in those particular sectors. [articlepreview id=\"1027526\" link=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/what-s-on/1027526/alone-to-host-valentine-s-afternoon-tea-party-with-kilkenny-lions-club.html\"] “Another trend we saw in Kilkenny and across the economy last year was that the level of applications did not keep up with the number of openings. With the economy reaching a 20 year low for unemployment and nearing full employment, this impacted the market. For some high demand sectors it became a candidate’s market. This, coupled with the rising cost of living, meant significant pressure on salaries in some high demand sectors over 2022. With the economy likely to be less buoyant in the next year, we expect this pressure will diminish as candidates in Kilkenny and nationally focus more on job security and work life balance considerations,” Ms. McCormack concluded.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Searches for part-time and weekend work soar amid cost-of-living squeeze',\n",
       "  'text': 'Searches for part-time and casual work surged in 2022, according to Indeed, with the recruitment company citing the impact of inflation on the cost of living. New data from the job site suggests there has been a “noticeable uptick” in job searches for part-time and weekend work, as well as jobs requiring no experience. Indeed said this increase likely reflected the need for those normally on the outskirts of the job market – such as the long-term unemployed or younger people – to enter or rejoin the workforce due to the financial squeeze felt from rising inflation. The top two searches in Ireland in 2022 were “visa sponsorship, healthcare assistant”, which rocketed 532 per cent, and “visa sponsorship, elderly care”, up 421 per cent. “Working visa sponsorship” came in at number six on its chart, up 214 per cent. Indeed said this could largely be attributed to inward searches for these positions from abroad, and echoes previous research that indicated that the Republic is one of only five European countries experiencing a “brain gain”, with more inward job searches from overseas than the reverse. Indeed’s latest wage tracker figures point to a general slowdown in wage growth to 4.4 per cent in the Irish labour market in December, indicating that wage growth rates have fallen below their 2022 peaks and remain well below the 8.2 per cent inflation rate recorded in the final month of last year. “These trends clearly show that jobseekers are feeling the pinch right now as wage growth sits at roughly half of inflation rates. Salary, benefits and job security are the main priorities for them when considering their career. However it’s possible we may see less frequent job-hopping as people become wary of moving in an uncertain environment,” said Jack Kennedy, economist at Indeed. “Rising searches for part-time and weekend work potentially reflects that people who need flexibility, such as parents, students, or people who are semi-retired, want to engage in the workforce in a way that can fit into their lives,” he said. Meanwhile, FRS Recruitment is forecasting growth in job postings in IT, construction and healthcare, with the company’s general manager Lynne McCormack saying there is “pent up demand” in these sectors. “In the IT sector, for example, even though there been some really significant and disappointing job redundancies announced by some of the major tech companies in recent months, we believe this will create movement in the market as smaller employers see this as an opportunity to source difficult-to-find, highly skilled talent.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'No plastic bottles, cups or cutlery: UCC eliminates single-use materials from campus',\n",
       "  'text': 'University College Cork (UCC) is eliminating all single-use plastic throughout restaurants, shops and vending machines as part of a wider drive to create a more sustainable campus. The university, which published its five-year strategic plan on Tuesday, is also creating the first dedicated sustainability and climate action office in Ireland’s higher education sector. To assist with the push to go plastic-free, water refill stations have been placed across campus, thousands of reusable cups have been handed out to staff and students and mini dishwashers have been installed across various locations. UCC president Professor John O’Halloran said “people and the planet” are at the heart of its development plans for the campus. “Together the UCC community has created a roadmap that will secure our future so that we can continue to inspire and shape future generations, while also providing the expertise and insight to meet the challenges our society faces,” he said, at the launch of the report on Tuesday. The move to go plastic-free came from students, he said, and has given the university a chance to become an “experimental ground” for how the rest of society can take similar measures. “This is a community of 25,000 students, 3,500 staff ... We estimate that UCC is the 14th largest settlement in the country,” he said. The new office of sustainability and climate action will be tasked to deliver on a range of environmental targets, while ensuring learning, teaching, research and operations lead the transition to a more sustainable future. The blueprint for the university also places a big focus on developing new postgraduate programmes, boosting international student numbers and widening student access to higher education. It plans to offer increased pathways into university courses from further education and is seeking to widen access to postgraduate education through philanthropy and other sources. Prof O’Halloran said about 23 per cent of its students come from “non-traditional pathways” and about 47 per cent of students at the university avail of student grants. It was important, he said, to ensure postgraduate options are made more accessible for all students. “The key is making sure that funding is not a barrier ... I’m a first generate graduate myself and a lot of support will be required,” he said. “We’re not in favour of students loans or anything like that. ... I lived in the US and we’ve seen the damage that it creates.” He said he was hopeful that the Government will deliver on promised additional funding for the sector to help ensure universities can provide all the supported needed for new students. Prof O’Halloran estimated that while universities received about €4,000 per student in Government funding about 10-15 years ago, this has since dwindled to about €1,500. Yet, over the same time period, the student intake has grown more complex with additional needs. On the question of student accommodation, he said the college’s Crow’s Nest development at Victoria Cross is close to completion and the university aims to provide a total of 2,000 student beds within the time frame of the strategic plan. Thousands of other beds are available in private, purpose-built student accommodation. “Affordability rather than availability is the issue,” he said, adding that its campus-based accommodation was pitched below competitor’s prices. The strategic plan also includes a programme of research prioritisation coupled with an academic recruitment across ten indicative areas of strategic importance. UCC said it has been actively recruiting leading researchers globally and placing a strong emphasis on attracting and supporting early career researchers. Prof O’Halloran said the university’s research is now focused on the “global grand challenges” as identified by the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. There are also plans to create a student forum, or a representative assembly of students, to enable constructive consultation and participation with university leaders.',\n",

       "  'text': 'An EU-wide shortage of qualified mechanics is creating “extraordinary pressure” for the National Car Test (NCT) service while a “driver availability” issue is hampering plans for the redesign of the Dublin bus network, according to a briefing document prepared for Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan. The document, drafted in December and published on Tuesday, outlines how the department is continuing to progress three public transport “megaprojects” – BusConnects, Dart+ and MetroLink – and states that “assuming timely planning approval from An Bord Pleanála” as well as other matters, construction work on the MetroLink could start in late 2025 and it could begin operating in the early 2030s. [ Driving examiners ‘put at risk’ after ruling that cars without NCT can be used for tests ] [ Average NCT wait times still rising amid confusion over ‘free tests’ ] The document notes backlogs in the NCT system have been receiving “prolonged media and political scrutiny” since the start of last year. “The contractor is providing additional vehicle inspectors from its Spanish operation,” the report notes, while the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has approved a pilot scheme to use additional inspection staff for automated test elements, and non-EU testers are receiving training. There will be no reduction in the quality of the tests being carried out, according to the report, and the department has received assurances from the RSA that the appointment of additional resources will not result in the loss of any existing jobs. Investment in public transport, which was €524 million in 2020, is expected to grow to €851 million this year, while from 2021 to 2025 it is envisaged that the equivalent of 20 per cent of the 2020 transport capital budget – approximately €360 million annually – will be invested in walking and cycling infrastructure on a whole-of-government basis, according to the report. [ Motorists entitled to free NCT tests over delays, but none have been offered, TD says ] [ NCT mechanics reject plan to hire auxiliary staff in effort to tackle backlog ] Hundreds of villages and rural areas are to be connected to the national bus network as part of a five-year Connecting Ireland plan. Priority is being given to areas where “the population and transport demands have increased due to the requirement to house Ukrainian refugees in rural locations”. In order to achieve the “ambitious levels of emissions reduction required in transport”, base demand is among the matters that have to be addressed, according to the report. A National Demand Management Strategy, to be developed this year, will consider a broad range of measures and their sequencing and timing, with the measures mentioned in the report including the removal of free workplace parking, increased parking charges, congestion and road-user charges, and increased fossil fuel prices. On aviation, the report notes that the pandemic caused airline passenger numbers to plummet globally but that a recent projection by Eurocontrol envisaged Irish passenger numbers returning to 2019 levels in 2023 and throughout Europe the following year. “Recovery is ongoing, and at a pace that surpassed initial predictions,” according to the report. “While aviation’s contribution to economic development has long been acknowledged and the importance of connectivity for an island nation is well-understood, the imperative to act to reduce our emissions across all sectors is also fully recognised,” the report said. On the introduction of a tax on aviation fuels, the report says “progress continues to be very slow at EU level with varying views between member states.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Housing for All – Q4 2022 Progress Report published - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': \"The Government today published the progress report for Quarter 4, 2022 under Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland. In the first full calendar year of the plan, almost 30,000 (29,851) new homes were completed, exceeding the target by over 20%. Construction started on 27,000 new homes in the year, the second highest since 2014. Strong activity has also been seen in the area of mortgage approvals, particularly for First Time Buyers (FTB), with recently published data showing FTB volumes at their highest levels since 2007. The supply of homes is increasing despite considerable challenges in the external environment. Since the launch of Housing for All, over 41,456 new homes have already been built. Actions during Quarter 4 include: Increased funding through the Affordable Housing Fund and the Cost Rental Equity Loan to make cost rental homes available at affordable prices. Help-to-Buy Scheme extended to the end of 2024 and consideration being given to expansion of the First Home Scheme to cover self-build housing. The Scheme, operational since July 2022, will support the purchase of 2,000 homes by eligible buyers in 2023. Funding of €94m provided to local authorities to address legacy land debts. Provision of this funding linked to the immediate development of a housing proposal, a commitment to use Modern Methods of Construction and construction to start in 2023/2024. Overall, over 30 sites have been identified for acceleration, involving over 1,500 new social homes. Launched Construct Innovate, Ireland’s Construction Technology Centre, to accelerate research and innovation in the construction sector. Publication of Report on the Analysis of Skills for Residential Construction and Retrofitting 2023-2030, along with Action Plan to attract and retain the necessary workforce – identified need for almost 51,000 new entrantsto meet the Government’s housing and retrofitting targets over the period to 2030. Developed Vacant Homes Action Plan, with several incentives available if you are turning a vacant house or building into your permanent home. €500 Rent Tax Credit for rent paid in 2022 and protection for renters by deferring any ‘no fault’ tenancy terminations from taking place this winter. Pre-Letting Expenses for landlords increased from €5,000 to €10,000, the length of time that a property must be vacant to be eligible reduced from 12 to 6 months. Publication of draft Residential Zoned Land Tax Maps as part of the implementation of the Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT). In addition, significant reform is underway including through the publication of a new Planning and Development 2023 Bill and approval by Government on General Scheme of Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones Bill. While progress has been strong, 2022 also saw the emergence of unprecedented challenges, leading to high inflation and rising interest rates. These issues are having a negative impact on the financial viability of home development and Government is focused on solving this through schemes such a Project Tosaigh and Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme. A new call for proposals was launched under Project Tosaigh in Q4 and the evaluation of responses is nearing completion, to be prioritised in accordance with 2023 and 2024 figures. The Housing Agency is now concluding appraisals of projects with the potential to build up to 2,100 apartments under the Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme, following the European Commission’s approval of Ireland’s State aid application for the scheme. Letters of approval will now be issued to successful applicants from the first call. Commenting on the publication of the report, the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar TD said: “Government is fully committed to reversing the trend of falling home ownership and rising homelessness. We are determined to make home ownership a reality for the many again. “This can only be achieved by increasing the supply of homes of all types. We have made good progress in the first full year of the Housing for All plan, and we will continue to work with stakeholders to accelerate and enhance the plan as we implement it. It is a comprehensive plan and, working with the Minister Darragh O'Brien, I will do all I can to drive it forward. “We need new and innovative ways to supply homes; no option will be taken off the table without due consideration. “We must apply the same spirit of determination, action and immediacy that we saw during the pandemic, to solving this social crisis.” The Tánaiste, Micheál Martin said “Homelessness is one of the greatest challenges facing our society today and a serious concern for Government. Though actions implemented in Quarter 4 such as the short-term ban on no-fault evictions, and actions taken to address the fundamental shortage of housing in our country, particularly social and affordable housing, we will turn the tide and provide homes for those in most need in our society” The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan said: “The adoption of Modern Methods of Construction has the potential to significantly improve construction sector productivity, innovation, sustainability and costs. In December, the Government launched Construct Innovate, Ireland’s Construction Technology Centre, to accelerate research and innovation in the construction sector. Already, a series of research projects are underway. The Centre is just one of several initiatives that will further support the use and development of Modern Methods of Construction in the delivery of Housing.” The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O’Brien TD added: “We are making significant progress in tackling vacancy and dereliction. Last week I launched the Vacant Homes Action Plan which details the upcoming measures that will bring even more vacant properties back into use. The new €150 million URDF call for proposals will help local authorities transform vacant and derelict buildings and sites in order to revitalise and regenerate our cities and large towns, and deliver more housing”. Notes to Editor Housing for All ‘Housing for All’ is the Government’s housing plan for Ireland to 2030. It can be read at www.gov.ie/housingforall. The plan’s overall objective is: ‘Everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life.’ The Housing for All – Q4 2022 Progress Report and Quarterly Statistics Report can be read here: https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/9d2ee-housing-for-all-quarterly-progress-reports\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Transport spending: Town and local bus services are the priority, says Eamon Ryan',\n",
       "  'text': 'The priority for the €3.5 billion spending by the Department of Transport this year is the development of local link and town bus services, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has said. In a discussion of the estimates for his department for 2023, Mr Ryan also said enhanced port development, designed to take advantage of a multibillion investment in the offshore wind farm sector, requires a “leap of faith” by the ports but has to be delivered. Addressing the Oireachtas committee on transport on department spending plans on Wednesday, Mr Ryan told Darren O’Rourke TD (SF Meath East) local link and town bus services represent the number one priority. “It is closing the gap where there is nothing in many instances,” he said. “Yes we should be faster but we are opening new bus services week in, week out.” The Minister said next week the National Transport Authority would present new routes that will open. “This should be the number one priority and it is,” he said. My Ryan said although road building would continue, the coming two years would see a shift in funding of two-to-one in favour of active travel and public transport. He revealed just €240.009 million of €1.387 billion earmarked for roads and road safety has been allocated to the construction of new national roads this year. Some €70 million will be spent on new regional and local road improvement schemes. Road schemes include the ongoing Dunkettle Interchange in Cork City, the N5 Westport-to-Turlough route in Co Mayo, the Listowel bypass in Co Kerry and N59 Moycullen bypass in Co Galway. Projects with planning approval that will continue to progress towards construction phase include the N28 Cork-to-Ringaskiddy road and the retendered N5 Ballaghdereen-to-Scramogue scheme in Co Roscommon. The Minister told TDs and Senators €358 million would be invested this year in “active travel” including the Safe Routes to School scheme on which the Department of Transport was working with local authorities to design and implement changes that would make it more attractive for people to chose active or public transport over the private car. “Tactical interventions in urban areas at low cost to deliver quick active travel wins,” he said. Mr Ryan said big ongoing active travel projects included the Clontarf-to-Amiens Street route in Dublin and the McCurtain street scheme in Cork. “My intention is that these demonstrator projects will pave the way for more widespread behavioural change in how we engage with transport as a society,” he said. Mr Ryan said from this year Government supports to encourage people to move to electric vehicles would switch from grants for private vehicles to investing in public EV charging infrastructure, He said BusConnects “spines” would continue to roll out with the planned introduction of South Dublin City orbital routes while planning would continue on BusConnects for regional cities. Overall, €876.504 million has been allocated to public transport including the balance of the order of 41 Intercity Railcars that will increase capacity on the intercity network. Construction will also continue on the National Train Control Centre, and tenders will be issued for the redevelopment of Ceannt station in Cork. The Cork Commuter Rail project, part-funded through the EU’s National Recovery and Resilience Programme, will also be progressed, he said. A total of €15 million is to be invested in rail and public transport accessibility projects. Mr Ryan said although ports are not directly funded by the exchequer “offshore renewable energy should be supported strategically, given its potential for addressing future energy requirements, decarbonisation, security of supply, and job creation in emerging industries of the future”. He said the demands of the offshore industry included quays with a water depth of at least 11 metres and length of between 400 and 500 metres. Although this investment would have to be made before the ports were awarded contracts to facilitate the deployment of turbines, blades and towers, it was “a leap of faith” that the port companies would have to make. Questioned by TDs and Senators on the possibility of this work going to ports such as Hamburg, Mr Ryan said Irish port infrastructure “will be delivered. It has to be”.',\n",

The work stoppages, which at least 270 Siptu members are expected to take part in, will to take place on 1 and 8 March. During the planned stoppages, Siptu members will place pickets at the Go Ahead Ireland depots in Ballymount, Dublin 12 and Naas, Co Kildare. Siptu representatives carried out a ballot for industrial action of its members employed by Go Ahead Ireland on 20 December. “In the ballot, an overwhelming majority voted for industrial action if management continued to refuse to engage on the issue of pay,” Siptu sector organiser John Murphy said. He said that following the vote, Go Ahead Ireland management agreed to attend talks at the Work Place Relations Commission but would not engage on the issue of pay. Siptu then referred the dispute to the Labour Court which it claims Go Ahead Ireland is refusing to attend. “The current collective agreement takes no account of the significant additional cost of living increases our members and their families are facing,” Murphy said. “Siptu representatives remain available to engage in constructive negotiations with management at all times. However, due to its appoach on this issue we fear industrial action is inevitable,” he said. Go Ahead Ireland operates a number of routes previously serviced by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.

       "  'text': 'The Minister for Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform, Paschal Donohoe TD, has today 10th February 2023, launched an updated Investment Projects and Programmes Tracker and updated MyProjectIreland interactive map. Project Ireland 2040 sets out a clear long-term strategy for public capital projects in Ireland backed by funding of €165 billion over a 10 year period as presented in the National Development Plan 2021–2030 (NDP). The updated Tracker and Map published today on http://www.gov.ie/2040, showcases the steady progress being made in the delivery of the NDP. The Tracker and Map were last published in May 2022. Speaking today, Minister Donohoe said: \"I am delighted that there continues to be significant advances made in the delivery of Project Ireland 2040. The investment tracker and interactive map provide citizens with a comprehensive overview of the capital projects being delivered in their own areas. This year my Department has increased capital investment by a further 10% to over €12 billion. This represents a solid pipeline of activity that will continue to support jobs across the construction sector.\" This Tracker update, which incorporates user-friendly dashboards, provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments that make up Project Ireland 2040. It focuses on over 320 projects and 140 programmes with estimated costs greater than €20 million. The Minister also said: \"Over the lifetime of the NDP, we are investing €165 billion in new and upgraded infrastructure that meets the needs of our growing population and enables delivery of our national priorities around critical areas such as housing, health and climate action. With the unprecedented scale of investment in the NDP, the ambition of the Government is clear. The Tracker and the Map published today demonstrate the many successes we have had in the delivery of the NDP so far. \"Delivering the NDP is a huge undertaking but we must, and will, continually strive to ensure that projects are completed on time and on budget. That is why the Government has decided to sharpen the focus on delivery even further in 2023. Reflecting its change in name, my Department is examining how the support structures and levers at Government’s disposal can be used to drive delivery, in support of my colleagues in Government who are the key players in the management and delivery of all our NDP projects. \"The Government is determined to deliver on the vision set out in the National Development Plan. Success will mean a better Ireland for the benefit of all our people.” ENDS',\n",

       "  'text': 'CONTRACTS have been signed for the design and construction of a multi-million euro development at the Opera Site in the heart of the city centre. Limerick Twenty Thirty has also announced details of a €80m joint venture which will boost the development of the Opera Square site-wide basement and the six storey One Opera Square office building. Located at the corner of Michael Street and Ellen Street, the project is Ireland’s largest scale development site and works are scheduled be completed by 2025. Details of the joint venture, which involves Limerick Twenty Thirty and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) means that the One Opera Square project have been confirmed by the Minister for Housing, Darragh O\\'Brien, who is on a visit to Limerick this Monday. The 3.7 acre site will be transformed into a daytime employment hub, as well as offering 450,000 square feet of accommodation to the people of Limerick. Commenting, Minister O’Brien said: “Opera Square will be a transformative development for Limerick, and I’m delighted the Government has been able to support Limerick Twenty Thirty in bringing it to fruition. The regeneration and rejuvenation of our towns and cities is a key part of this government’s vision. “We are tackling vacancy and dereliction, and will continue to fund important regeneration projects in the country.” Separately to the funding announcement, Limerick Twenty Thirty has confirmed the appointment of John Sisk and Son for the design and construction of the circa 10,000sqm Opera Square site-wide basement and six storey One Opera Square office building.

Mayor of the City and County of Limerick, Cllr Francis Foley welcomed this Monday\\'s announcement: “This is a hugely significant moment for the wider Opera Square development, Limerick and, indeed, the Mid-West region. This is the moment when we can finally say that, two decades after the redevelopment of this site was first mooted by the private sector, building is now finally underway. One Opera Square is one of the flagship projects in the Opera Square programme which, together with other private and public investments already underway in Limerick, is going to transform our city centre, setting it on a new course that will make it one of the most competitive and attractive locations in Europe to live, work and play in.” Nick Ashmore, Director of ISIF, added: “This is an important step forward in our €500m investment programme to unlock the economic potential of Ireland’s five regional cities. We are delighted to show our backing for Limerick and the wider mid-west region with our biggest single investment to date from this programme. Our investment is about making Limerick an even better place for employers to create more jobs and making it an even more attractive place for people to work. Limerick has so much going for it and ISIF looks forward to backing more investments in the city and the region over the coming years.”',\n",

       "  'text': \"Dublin bus operator Go-Ahead “must pay staff more during the cost-of-living crisis” to avoid unnecessary strikes next month, according to a Labour TD. Duncan Smith is calling on Go-Ahead Ireland management to engage with SIPTU immediately to avoid widespread strikes and disruption across the bus network over the coming weeks.According to SIPTU, members will stage 24-hour strikes on March 1 and March 8 with pickets at the company's depots in Ballymount, Dublin and Naas.“The refusal of Go-Ahead to engage in meaningful talks on pay that will honestly take into account the impact of the cost-of-living crisis is utterly regrettable,” Labour transport spokesperson Deputy Smith said.“SIPTU members in Go-Ahead are not immune from the inflationary pressures that hundreds of thousands of workers are facing and they need to see some real light at the end of the tunnel.“The reality is that the current collective agreement takes no account whatsoever of the significant additional cost-of-living increases workers are facing. That needs to change.“Across the water, the same company has agreed a significant pay deal for its workers and the demands for a similar approach to be taken for the company’s 300 workers in Ireland is a fair and reasonable one.“The onus is now on Go-Ahead management to pull out all the stops and respect the plight of their hard-working staff.“They must immediately, meaningfully engage with union representatives and do everything in their power to avoid these unnecessary strikes,” he added.The dispute over pay has come due to rising costs facing workers and businesses nationwide.SIPTU Sector Organiser, John Murphy, added: “SIPTU representatives conducted a ballot for industrial action of our members employed by Go-Ahead Ireland on December 20.“This vote was required due to the refusal of management to engage through the normal agreed process in talks concerning an increase in pay for our members to take account of the impact of the cost-of-living crisis.“In the ballot, an overwhelming majority voted for industrial action if management continued to refuse to engage on the issue of pay. Following this vote, management did agree to attend talks at the Workplace Relations Commission.“However, at these talks it refused to engage on the pay issue separately to other matters. We then referred the dispute to the Labour Court, which the company is now refusing to attend.”SIPTU Organiser, Andrew Quigley, added: “Our members are frustrated at the refusal by management to engage constructively on the issue of pay rises.“The current collective agreement takes no account of the significant additional cost-of-living increases our members and their families are facing.“In the UK, the same company has reached an agreement for a significant increase to its employees’ pay in line with inflationary pressures. We are demanding a similar approach be taken with its over 300 employees in Ireland.”Independent.ie has contacted Go-Ahead Ireland for comment.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Minister of State for Trade Promotion and Digital Transformation, Dara Calleary, TD, today turned the sod on the site of the new Advancing Innovation in Manufacturing (AIM) Centre in Sligo. The new facility will focus on developing capability in cutting-edge manufacturing technology in companies across the Northwest region.This innovative project is driven by Atlantic Technological University (ATU), Sligo County Council and Leitrim County Council and is supported by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment administered through Enterprise Ireland.Speaking at the event today Minister Calleary said; “I am delighted to be here in Sligo to formally turn the sod on the new home for the AIM Centre at the old fire station at Market Yard. This is an ambitious, innovative project that will provide companies across the Northwest with access to new and emerging manufacturing and supply chain management technology. There is a technological revolution occurring in this important sector and it is vital that Irish enterprise is ahead of the curve in adapting to change. As well as helping businesses adapt and become more competitive, projects such as this are crucial if we are to develop a resilient enterprise ecosystem to provide high-quality jobs and employment opportunities for people to live and prosper in all regions.“I would like to acknowledge the vision of Atlantic Technological University, Sligo County Council and Leitrim County Council in championing this important project, which my Department is proud to support with funding of almost €2 million delivered through Enterprise Ireland’s Border Enterprise Development Fund.”Welcoming the commencement of construction work, Councillor Michael Clarke, Cathaoirleach, Sligo County Council, said; \"Today marks a huge step forward in bringing this very innovative and forward-looking project to fruition. I want to acknowledge the huge effort, vision and collaboration of all the key players, including the Atlantic Technological University, Enterprise Ireland, Rhatigan Architects, the contractor, Joseph McMenamin & Sons Ltd., Julie Dowling, Director of the AIM project and of course my colleagues and staff in Sligo County Council. This project has the potential to be a gamechanger for industry in Sligo and beyond, while also boosting local trade.\"Dr. Chris O’Malley, Vice President of Research, Innovation and Engagement with ATU said; “Manufacturing is undergoing a technological revolution with tens of thousands of jobs at stake across our region. ATU is delighted to collaborate with Sligo County Council, Leitrim County Council and Enterprise Ireland in taking this initiative to help our companies address that challenge, drawing on the expertise and facilities across all the ATU campuses and partner networks across the country and beyond. It’s about putting knowledge at the service of the region.”Recently appointed director of the AIM Centre, Julie Dowling said; “It is fantastic to see the renovation work on the old fire station commence. Whilst we await the use of our state-of-the art facility, several cutting-edge projects are already in-flight with businesses in the region. Currently the AIM team are operating out of Sligo ATU Innovation Centre. We have a team of experienced resources in the fields of artificial intelligence and analytics, robotics and automation, business strategy, research and engineering. Businesses are under pressure with ever changing landscapes brought about from Brexit and covid, followed by an energy crisis, global inflation, and talent retention issues. New technology can assist organisations with such challenges, and the AIM centre have the resources to help find the optimal solution for them.”Carol Gibbons, Divisional Manager, Regions and Local Enterprise, with Enterprise Ireland said; “It is really positive to see this great project coming to fruition with the formal sod turning today. I am confident that the knowledge and expertise located in the Aim Centre will be of immense benefit to companies across the Northwest region as they use emerging technology to drive productivity and competitiveness. This project is one of 11 transformative projects currently being supported by Enterprise Ireland through the Border Enterprise Development Fund, a specific initiative to support entrepreneurship in the Border counties post-Brexit.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'In its submission, The Irish Home Builders Association, a part of the Construction Industry Federation, will tell politicians that there are potentially 70,000 homes awaiting a decision by An Bord Pleanála. The association will also say that a judicial review of homes that have already been granted permission can add between €10,000 and €20,000 per unit to build costs. Housing Minister Darragh O\\'Brien\\'s bill looks to limit access to judicial reviews to those who have a material interest in a development. The statement, which will be read by the IHBA\\'s director Conor O\\'Connell, says that housing commencements, which were down 13% last year, will have fallen dramatically in the last 12 months when figures are compiled. \\'Time is money\\' \"We estimate that there are over 70,000 housing units waiting for a decision in An Bord Pleanála and in the courts, nearly two years\\' supply of homes. \"The old expression that “time is money” has never been more appropriate in the current economic environment as increases in the cost of materials, the rising interest rates, and other factors mean that the extraordinarily long delays being currently experienced in the planning and legal system results in more costs being added to a new home. \"These are adding unnecessary delays to our younger generations securing their new homes. Commencements have declined by 13% last year and we expect that planning permissions will see a dramatic decline over the last 12 months.\" Mr O\\'Connell will tell the committee that while there are many planning permissions already granted for homes, most in urban areas are for apartments. He will say apartments have \"always been a challenge to deliver due to their high delivery costs and it will be difficult to see many commence in 2023\". Objections He will say government schemes such as Project Tosaigh and the Croí Conaithe cities scheme may yield results in terms of apartment commencements in the latter half of 2023 but demand for traditional housing units remains strong and is the preference for most people. Mr O\\'Connell will tell the committee that house builders trying to deliver homes are \"concerned they may run out of permissions in areas of high demand in late 2023 and that the resourcing in the planning system is \"at a critical juncture\" and will argue for stronger safeguards around planning objections. \"We have seen objections based on the claim from individuals that their houses may be devalued. We have seen objections to housing from organisations or individuals living several hundred kilometres away from the site, we have seen politicians objecting to housing who, at the same time, are calling for more housing. This simply cannot continue if we are serious about an inclusive and harmonious society where the provision of housing is facilitated by the state with appropriate legislation and procedures.\" Representatives of Property Industry Ireland, the Ibec group for the construction and property sectors, will tell the committee that finance has become an issue for builders and potential homebuyers. \"In the delivery of new homes, homebuilders face many challenges. At present, the growth in input cost inflation is impacting on viability and the new home pipeline. Financing is now a particular constraint. Interest rate rises have had a major impact. There are supports for owner-occupiers, but a critical challenge will be in the delivery of homes to rent. Uncertainty can also play a key role in homebuilders decision-making.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Joint agents Cushman & Wakefield and Sherry FitzGerald New Homes are guiding a price of €59 million for the Rockpoint apartment development in Blackrock, Co Dublin. The scheme, which is under construction currently and due for practical completion in the final quarter of this year, will comprise a total of 91 apartments distributed across two blocks. Aimed towards the upper end of the private rented sector market, the development will consist of a mix of 49 one-bedroom apartments, 38 two-bedroom apartments and three three-bedroom units, along with 71 underground car-parking spaces. Rockpoint is well located in Blackrock and just 7km southeast of Dublin city centre. The scheme is situated just off the Frascati Road (N31) and within a short walk of both Seapoint and Blackrock Dart stations and Blackrock Village itself. While the €59 million being sought for the development equates to a significant average price of €648,351 per unit, the selling agents say they expect rents in Rockpoint to range from €2,600 to over €4,000 for the larger units. The portfolio is being offered to the market by way of a forward-purchase agreement on behalf of Seabren Developments – the company led by Michael Moran of the Red Cow Moran Hotel. Seabren acquired the 0.5-hectare Rockpoint site from developer Pat Crean’s Marlet Property Group in 2020 for about €7.5 million. At the time of that sale the former Europa Garage lands had planning permission in place for a smaller development of 42 apartments and nine houses. Seabren secured planning permission for the present scheme from An Bord Pleanála in 2021 in the face of objections from a number of parties including the former president of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.',\n",

       "  'title': 'US says new weapons will help Ukraine mount ‘decisive’ spring offensive',\n",
       "  'text': 'Ukrainian officials denied Russia’s claims that its invasion force had taken more territory in eastern Ukraine, and the United States said the West planned to give Kyiv the weapons needed to achieve “decisive” results in an expected spring offensive. Heavy fighting continued in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as the European Commission unveiled plans for a 10th package of sanctions against Russia, and Nato said its members were ramping up ammunition production to keep supplies flowing to Kyiv and replenish its own stocks. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Wednesday that during an offensive by its forces in Luhansk region, “Ukrainian troops retreated in disarray to a distance of up to three kilometres from previous positions. Even the enemy’s more fortified second line of defence could not stop the breakthrough by the Russian military.” Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of the partly occupied Luhansk region, said claims that Russian troops had pushed Kyiv’s forces back to the border of the province “do not correspond to reality – our forces are holding the line”. “We see there is an escalation, especially in the direction of Bilohorivka and Kreminna. There is a lot of shelling and aircraft are already involved – the Russians are constantly attacking in waves from different sides,” he added. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the most intense fighting was now taking place around the towns of Bakhmut and Vuhledar in the Donetsk region. Describing Bakhmut as a “living wall” that holds back Russian forces, he said Ukraine’s people “are standing strong, defending themselves resolutely, and they understand they are a fortress that allows Ukraine to prepare for the de-occupation of all its territories”. Referring to the February 24th anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of his country, Mr Zelenskiy said “there is a feeling that the new year in Ukraine now starts on the 24th… We want this year to be a year of victory.” After a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said recent western pledges of tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, missile systems and other modern weaponry were intended to ensure that Ukraine’s forces “can be decisive on the battlefield in their upcoming offensive”. “And so with that additional capability, better trained troops, platforms that can perform a lot better in this environment, I think they’ll have a real good chance at making a pretty significant difference on the battlefield and establishing the initiative, and being able to exploit that initiative,” he added. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said member states were stepping up production of ordnance in response to Ukraine’s use of “an enormous quantity of allied ammunition” which was “depleting our stockpiles”. “So the production of, for instance, artillery shells… is now increasing, and that enables us to both replenish our own stocks… but also to continue to provide support to Ukraine,” he explained. “We have seen the big need… and now we see that contracts are signed and production is ramping up.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to undermine Moscow’s ability to wage war in Ukraine by imposing export bans worth €11 billion, which would “deprive the Russian economy of critical technology and industrial goods”. The sanctions would hit electronics, specialised vehicles, machine parts, spare parts for trucks and jet engines, and goods for the construction sector that could be used by the Russian military, including antennas and cranes. Dual-use and advanced technologies are also to be hit, with 47 electrical components that can potentially be used to power Russian drones, missiles and helicopters set to be barred from export to Russia, along with certain rare earth materials and thermal cameras.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Dublin City Council pays 40% over the odds for social housing, audit finds',\n",
       "  'text': 'Dublin City Council has been paying in excess of 40 per cent more for the construction of social housing than private sector developers, an independent audit of more than 1,000 Dublin homes has found. Council officials had been “severely restricted” in their ability to control costs within Government and EU procurement rules and systems, according to the report by public management consultancy Seán Ó Riordáin and Associates Ltd and Trinity College economics professor Ronan Lyons. The “review of the construction costs associated with the council’s building of housing units” was commissioned by the council after concerns were raised in 2021 that it was paying a “premium” for the construction of social housing with costs that were significantly higher than those achieved by approved housing bodies (AHBs) and private developers. The analysis of 28 housing schemes across the three sectors, with a total of 1,023 homes built between 2019 and the end of last year, found the council was paying 23 per cent more than AHBs and 44 per cent more than private developers for a similar two-bedroom apartment. When the all-in costs of development were taken into account, and the apartments weighted for their size, the review found one-bedroom apartments provided directly by council cost €335,000, 11 per cent above the equivalent figure for AHBs (€303,000) and 34 per cent above the figure for “Part Vs “(€250,000). Under Part V legislation developers are required to allocate a number of homes for sale to local authorities for social housing. For two-bedroom homes, the council construction costs of €514,000 were 23 per cent above the AHB average of €418,000 and 44 per cent above the Part V average €358,000. The council paid an average of €600,000 for the construction of three-bedroom apartments during this period. However, as only a small number of “non-council” three-bedroom properties were built during the three-year period, they were excluded from the analysis. The difference in costs could, in part, be attributed to the differing nature of the projects, the report said. Council schemes were generally smaller, with an average of 43 homes compared with a private sector average of 180, of which 18 were set aside for social housing. Council schemes were typically regeneration or “brownfield” sites which were more costly to build on than private developers’ greenfield sites. Nonetheless, “it would not be appropriate to conclude that cost differentials between public and private delivery can be explained entirely by scale... and wider project nature”, the report said. “Issues such as the application of public procurement rules and the impact of policy shifts, application of differing standards in the use of construction materials, etc, can and do impact upon the cost environment for both public and private delivery of construction.” In addition, it said “councils do not have the option of entering into long-term commercial relationships where long-run production of construction materials and predetermined fixtures and fittings can be facilitated as is the case for private-led investment”. The systems used to develop these homes meant the capacity for council officials “to make substantive decisions around cost control was severely restricted, particularly when there were changes in regulatory specifications and requirements at a national level that had an impact on costs”. Following the introduction of the Government’s Housing For All policy, an international cost management framework was being introduced to local authorities which should assist in the council controlling costs, the report concluded. Fine Gael councillor James Geoghegan said it was “a serious concern that proper accounting and cost control measures and procedures were not in place” when these homes were built. “Because of how these projects were managed, the council was not able to maintain control over costs, and what this report shows is that Dublin City Council paid a premium price for that.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Shares of the company that operates one of China’s top investment banks, China Renaissance, plunged on Friday after the firm said it had lost touch with its founder Bao Fan, one of the country’s most high-profile bankers and a top tech-sector dealmaker. China Renaissance Holdings said in a filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange on Thursday that it had been unable to contact Mr Bao, who has worked on major deals including e-commerce company JD.com’s two billion dollar (£1.6 billion) initial public offering and the public listing of short video platform Kuaishou in Hong Kong.The company said that it was “not aware of any information that indicates Mr Bao’s unavailability” was related to the business of the group.Mr Bao’s disappearance follows a crackdown on big technology companies in the past two years that officials in China said had been completed.Shares in China Renaissance fell as much as 50% on Friday in Hong Kong. They were down about 28% in the afternoon.China Renaissance did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.A foreign ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin, said he was not aware of the situation when asked at a news briefing.“I would like to stress that China is a country under rule of law, and the Chinese government protects the rights and interests of Chinese citizens in accordance with law,” he said.Mr Bao’s disappearance comes months after former China Renaissance president Cong Lin was taken away by Chinese authorities in September last year, according to Chinese news media outlet Caixin, which first reported the news.Investigations in China targeting the financial sector have ensnared dozens of officials and finance executives at institutions such as Everbright Securities, China Construction Bank and major bank ICBC.Mr Bao earlier worked at Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.

       "  'text': 'Ireland’s property market proved to be resilient to cost-of-living fears and external pressures throughout last year, a new report has said. The MyHome.ie quarterly house price report found the market had held up better than evidence had suggested in 2022.The number of vendors cutting asking prices remained at low levels, while house prices were being settled above asking prices.However, the report warned that the resilience of the housing marking is set to be tested this year. The report found annual asking price inflation slowed to 6% nationwide, and was 3.6% in Dublin and 7.6% elsewhere around the country.Meanwhile, the report found quarterly asking price inflation dropped by 0.4% nationally, by 0.8% in Dublin, and by 0.2% elsewhere around the country.Asking prices for the average home in the Republic rose almost 11 per cent to 320,000 euro in the 12 months to June, it says.It means the asking prices for the average home in Ireland is now 330,000 euro, while the price in Dublin is 436,000 euro and elsewhere around the country it is 283,000 euro.There were 15,000 available properties for sale on MyHome.ie in the fourth quarter of the year – an improvement on the same time last year but still below pre-pandemic levels.Average time to sale agreed was 2.7 months nationwide which the report said is indicative of a very tight housing market.Average mortgage approval in October was 280,600 euro – up 4.3% on the year.Residential property market transactions are set to exceed 21 billion euro in 2022, a rise of 7.5% in volume terms compared with 2021.The average residential transaction in the third quarter of last year was 370,000 euro, almost eight times the average income of 48,000 euro which is the highest multiple in over a decade.The report said it expects to see 28,400 houses completions in 2022, exceeding its previous forecast of 26,500 units completed.The author of the report, Conall MacCoille, chief economist at stockbrokers Davy, said it appeared the market had held up better than evidence had suggested.“The number of vendors cutting their asking prices is still at low levels. Also, transactions in Q4 were still being settled above asking prices, indicative of a tight market,” he said.“There are 15,000 properties listed for sale on MyHome.ie, an improvement from the beginning of 2022 but below pre-pandemic levels exceeding 20,000.“The average time to sale agreed in Q4 was just 2.7 months, still close to historic lows.”He added that even if mortgage interest rates rise to 4%, debt service ratios are unlikely to become stretched and there will be only a limited headwind to house prices.Mr MacCoille noted that already stretched valuations in Ireland could be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times income.He said this gave an upside risk to the 4% house price inflation prediction for next year.He added that recent months had seen worrying trends in the homebuilding sector, with housing starts slowing, and the construction PMI survey pointing to the flow of new development drying up.“We still expect housing completions will pick up to 28,400 in 2022 and 27,000 in 2023. However, the outlook for 2024 is far more uncertain. The government’s ambitious plans to expedite planning processes are welcome although, as ever, the proof will be in the pudding,” he added.Joanne Geary, managing director of MyHome.ie, said that vendor sentiment had been somewhat affected by rising costs and interest rates.“Over 3% of all properties on MyHome.ie saw asking price reductions in Q4, a low rate but even still the highest figure since Q3 2020,” she said.“However, asking prices tend to fall toward the end of the year, for example, declining by 1.1% on average in the last quarter pre-pandemic. While asking price increases have cooled, the market has still remained remarkably resilient despite the uncertain environment.”She said that stock levels were still a cause for concern.“Stock levels are improving but are still not running at the levels we need to see in order to satisfy demand. As such, we hope to see inflationary pressures ease in the construction sector over the coming months.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'House prices have stretched to almost eight times the average salary, the largest gap for more than a decade. The figures come from the latest MyHome.ie/Davy Q4 Property Price Report, which predicts that residential prices will rise by 4pc this year, down from 6pc last year.It says that prices rose by 3.6pc in Dublin over the last 12 months and by 7.6pc outside the capital. However, all regions experienced price falls in the last quarter of the year, with Dublin falling the most, at 0.8pc.The report comes as property prices in the UK have fallen for four consecutive months, the longest negative run since the height of the previous property boom in 2008.House prices in most major western markets are expected to decline this year, according to a recent Reuters poll, after increases of up to 50pc since the start of the pandemic in 2020.Since 2013, average house prices in Ireland have risen by over 130pc, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). However, the MyHome.ie/Davy report claims that it is still cheaper to own a house than to rent, comparing CSO private rent rises of 11pc last year to average mortgage rates of under 3pc.The report predicts that the final figure for housing completions last year will be 28,400, above the Government’s previously stated target of 24,600. However, it warns that this year will be an “especially uncertain outlook” due to external pressures, despite the “resilience” of the property market last year amid high energy prices, inflation, interest rates and the war on Ukraine.Nationally, the median asking price for a house is €330,000, down 0.4pc for the quarter but up 6pc for the year, according to the report.In Dublin, the median price is €436,000, down 0.8pc for the quarter but up 3.6pc for the year. Outside Dublin, the media price is €283,000, down 0.2pc for the quarter but up 7.6pc for the year.The report says there were 15,000 available properties for sale on MyHome.ie in the fourth quarter, more than the same period a year ago but still below pre-pandemic levels. The average mortgage approval rose to €280,600 in October, up 4.3pc on the previous year, while the average time in reaching a “sale agreed” status in the last quarter was 2.7 months nationwide which the report claims is indicative of “a very tight housing market”.Overall, residential property market transactions will settle at over €21bn for 2022, according to the report, up 7.5pc in volume on 2021.The author of the report, Davy chief economist Conall Mac Coille, warned that buyers were stretched to a degree not seen since 2009.“The average residential transaction in Q3 2022 was €370,000, now 7.7 times the average income of €48,000,” he said. “This is a similar valuation multiple to the UK, where house prices are now falling due to a surge in mortgage rates above 6pc.”He said that “already stretched valuations” in Ireland could be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times’ income. He said this gives an “upside risk” to the 4pc house price inflation prediction for next year.He added that recent months had seen worrying trends in the home-building sector, with housing starts slowing and the construction PMI survey pointing to the flow of new development drying up.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The latest quarterly housing report for MyHome.ie found inflation in asking prices for homes dropped in the last three months of 2022, as is typical for Q4 of a year, but 3% of homes listed for sale actually dropped their price. Over the year, asking prices rose by 6% to a national median of €330,000. In Dublin, median asking prices rose 3.6% to €436,000, while they rose 7.6% outside of Dublin to €283,000. The median asking price in Cork City rose 5.3% in the year to €279,000. A typical two-bed apartment in Cork, meanwhile, rose 5% to €205,000. Davy chief economist Conall MacCoille, who authored the MyHome.ie report, warned the figures show buyers are being stretched to a degree not seen since 2009. “The average residential transaction in Q3 2022 was €370,000, now 7.7x the average income of €48,000,” he said. “This is a similar valuation multiple to the UK, where house prices are now falling due to a surge in mortgage rates above 6%.” Mr MacCoille said already stretched valuations of homes in Ireland could be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times’ income. Describing it both as a “key development” and a “surprise decision”, the economist said the Central Bank estimates it will eventually add 8% to Irish house prices over three years. But he said this 8% could all come in just one year. “It is quite possible that first-time buyers could act more quickly to take on more leverage on their borrowing as they compete for the limited pool of homes listed for sale,” Mr MacCoille said. “This poses an upside risk to our forecast for 4% house price inflation in 2023.” Elsewhere in the latest MyHome.ie report, it says 15,000 properties were available for sale on the platform in Q4, which is still below pre-pandemic levels. The average time to sale agreed in Q4 was 2.7 months, indicative of a “very tight” housing market. The average mortgage approval in October was €280,600, up 4.3% on last year, while the statistics show that, “for those who can get on the ladder, there is an incentive to buy over renting”. Recent trends in the homebuilding sector, however, are described as worrying, with the construction PMI indicator pointing to the flow of new development potentially drying up. Mr MacCoille said the Government’s new First Home scheme “will help overcome viability concerns on housing developments arising from build cost inflation”. But the pick-up in funding costs could well impede apartment development, he added, which has been reliant on institutional investment into the private rental sector. He said it remained the case the market for apartment blocks built for ordinary home buyers just is not there. He said an opinion remains apartments cannot be built and just sold off to ordinary home buyers, as they are expensive to build and difficult to secure finance for. “We still expect housing completions will pick up to 28,400 in 2022 and 27,000 in 2023,” he said. “However, the outlook for 2024 is far more uncertain. The Government’s ambitious plans to expedite planning processes are welcome although, as ever, the proof will be in the pudding.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Teacher shortages: it will get worse before getting better Schools struggled to find substitution cover at primary last year, while at second level qualified teachers in key subjects were in short supply. The issue calmed down in December due, mainly, to the availability of thousands of student teachers. These subs are back in college and the issue will come back into focus once again. Norma Foley has pointed to a host of initiatives aimed at boosting teacher supply such as easing employment restrictions for teachers on career breaks, job shares, etc – but, at its heart, this is an issue tied up with the housing crisis. Many teachers have relocated to cheaper parts of the country or abroad. If meaningful progress is to be made, expect more radical moves such as funding teacher education, more permanent contracts or fast-tracking recognition for teachers abroad. Otherwise, it will rumble on. Leaving Cert reform: battles ahead Most senior cycle reform plans will take years to realise – but the rubber hits the road this year with plans for students entering senior cycle in September 2023 to sit paper one in English and Irish at the end of fifth year. Standing in the way are teachers’ unions. English and Irish teachers’ groups feel especially aggrieved over changes that they say will hurt students. Others see this as a proxy fight over wider plans to introduce teacher-based assessment for up to 40 per cent of marks. Foley insists the changes will ease the burden on students. The future of senior-cycle reform may well hinge on getting this over the line. Free schoolbooks: jostling over costs to parents Funding of almost €50 million was announced in last September’s Budget to provide free schoolbooks and “related classroom resources” to all 540,000 pupils attending primary schools. However, education publishers and independent booksellers believe there are not enough resources to fulfil this pledge and they plan to join forces to highlight these issues in the new year. Some in the sector estimate the allocated funding is in the region of between €80-90 per pupil, yet research by the Irish League of Credit Unions puts the average cost of books at primary level at €110. Expect jostling over whether there is sufficient money to deliver the announcement or whether parents will be expected to fund the difference. Abuse inquiry: ensuring accountability A Government inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse by priests at some of the country’s leading private fee-paying schools looks set to be announced later this month. The calls for an inquiry followed, in particular, recent revelations of historical child sexual abuse in schools run by the Spiritan congregation, particularly at their Willow Park school and Blackrock College in South Dublin. The inquiry will need to be carefully constituted to ensure it enables survivors to have their voices heard and does not impede any Garda investigation. It is a complex task which, based on experience, may take years to complete. Learning loss: the shadow of Covid-19 Incredibly, there is no Department of Education report yet into the extent of any learning loss linked to Covid school closures. Yet, many other jurisdictions have long since quantified the degree to which students have fallen behind. Research from the Netherlands, which had a shorter period of school closures, indicates that primary children performed on average 20 per cent worse on standardised tests and some disadvantaged pupil scored up to 60 per cent worse. Anecdotally, school leaders in Ireland point to a range of deficits – yet, funding has been pulled for Covid catch-up learning programmes. We may see shortly the first indications of any learning gaps in international surveys. The Pirls (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) was conducted in autumn 2021 among student in fifth class. Those results, due soon, will be revealing. School funding: ‘one-off’ measures to continue The Government announced “once-off” funding of €90 million for schools to cope with higher energy bills, equivalent to a 40 per cent increase in school capitation, last October. But few observers expect the cost of energy to dip significantly in 2023. Similar levels of funding, then, are likely to be needed to help school make ends meet later this year. As any politician will tell you, it’s always difficult to end once-off measures which, inevitably, appear as spending cuts. As a result, we may well see a new era of better-resourced schools where fewer are forced to constantly seek parental contributions. Lifelong learning: making college more affordable While we are star pupils across a number of education metrics, we’re nowhere near top of the class when it comes to lifelong learning. Latest Eurostat figures show just under 14 per cent of workers aged 25 to 65 in Ireland participate in upskilling to bolster their professional development, well below participation rates in Sweden (34 per cent) and Finland (30 per cent). The EU’s lifelong learning target is for at least 60 per cent of the adult population to participate in some form of training every year by 2030. So, expect to see moves to make college more affordable and accessible for lifelong learners such as Susi grants for part-time students, greater prior recognition of learning and moves towards more micro-credentials for time-pressed upskillers. Primary curriculum: biggest changes in 20 years A shake-up in how teaching and learning takes place in primary schools – the most dramatic in 20 years – is on the way. A new framework for the primary curriculum, currently under consideration by Norma Foley, could see a reduction in time allocated to religious faith formation and other core subjects. Instead schools would be given much more “flexible time” to decide which areas of learning they want to prioritise. The draft changes could see an increased emphasis on areas such as PE, digital learning and the introduction of foreign languages, education about world religion and ethics, and a broader arts education. Anxious generation: what’s bothering our schoolkids? School principals have expressed concern over rising levels of emotional ill-health, anxiety and mental health problems in schools since the pandemic. Teachers are not experts, psychologists or mental health professionals - yet this is the type of help many pupils need. A new pilot project to provide in-school counselling is due to begin this year. It will be watched closely to see if it can meet children’s needs and become a model for how to better respond to children’s needs. School meals: move to expand scheme A Government programme provides funding towards the provision of free meals to about 1,600 schools benefiting 260,000 children. A report that will shortly be on the desk of Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys – whose department funds the scheme – has a bold recommendation: expand school meals to all primary children by 2030. It sounds fanciful. On closer inspection, it may well be achievable. School meal companies currently provide hot meals to order across many schools that don’t even have canteens at relatively low cost; and under an EU child guarantee, all children in need should have access to a healthy school meal each day. Skills gaps: more apprenticeships Ireland is facing urgent skills gaps across a range of areas such as construction, retrofitting and renewable energy, to name just a few. Increasingly, policymakers see the further education and training sector as key to providing a pipeline of skilled graduates in these areas and others. A key obstacle has been a status problem: many parents and students see it as a “second best” option after college. This year more students will begin to see the smart option of “earn and learn” options which, in many cases, deliver jobs, degrees and decent earnings. School buildings: delays ahead Soaring construction inflation in the latter half of last year ate into the budget for new school buildings. Basic building costs in the education sector, based on tender outcomes, grew by 21 per cent in the first half of last year. There is no sign of these trends abating. With fewer projects taking up more limited resources, it seems inevitable there will be knock-on effects on the delivery of new school buildings and other major projects. Special needs: assessing children’s needs Education authorities were forced to pause the roll-out of controversial school-based education assessments for children with additional needs following concerns among principals, teachers’ unions and campaigners. Campaign groups warned that principals did not have the expertise to identify children’s support needs and warned that the system was potentially unlawful. The health and education system will need to urgently develop a fit-for-purpose model to ensure vulnerable children do not slip through the net. [ Breda O’Brien: School hiring rules need to be reformed to make it easier to find substitute teachers ] 2022: A good year for ... Norma Foley: she secured a record budget, announced free schoolbooks at primary level and an ambitious education reform plan for senior cycle ... now she just has to deliver them. No pressure, then. Technological universities: Following a decade-long campaign, the southeast Technological University was finally established with the merger of WIT and IT Carlow. The new university has a total student population of 18,500 students across four campuses.

       "  'title': 'Amazing snapshot of life in Ireland in 2022 released by CSO',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Central Statistics Office has released a snapshot into Irish life in 2022. The release is the first part of an overall release of figures and the initial figures concentrate on Society & Environment. Other statistics will be released shortly. Amongst the many details released in the first batch of information includes the most common Irish name for babies, fraud figures and where Ireland’s most energy efficient homes are. The CSO 2022 Highlights section, based on data published by the CSO throughout 2022 up to 12 December 2022, is divided up under the following topics: Our Lives; Our Working Life; Our Society; Our Lives Online; and Our Environment. Population As of Census night on 03 April, the preliminary population count of Ireland in 2022 is 5.1 million – an increase of 7.6% from Census 2016 and the largest population recorded in a Census since 1841. It also showed that all counties experienced a growth in population. Looking at Population and Migration Estimates, there were 768,900 people aged 65 and over living in Ireland as of April 2022, which was an increase of 139,100 people since 2016. The proportion of the population now living in Dublin has also increased to 28.4% of the total in 2022 and now stands at 1,451,000 people. Ukrainian Arrivals As of the week ending 06 November 2022, there were 62,425 people who had arrived from Ukraine to Ireland, of which 34% were aged 19 or younger. Using Census 2016 figures we can see the impact of the war, as at that time there were 4,624 people who were born in Ukraine but were usually resident in Ireland. Names When it comes to naming our children, we picked a wider variety of names for girls in 2021 (4,741 names registered in 2021) than boys (3,863). Fiadh topped the most popular name for girls in 2021 for the first time, ousting the perennially popular Grace, while Jack remained as the most popular name for boys. The number of babies born in 2021 was 58,443, an increase of 2,484 on 2020. The 2021 total is almost 22% lower than 10 years ago when 74,650 births were registered in 2011. The top 10 surnames for babies in 2021 were Murphy, Kelly, Ryan, Walsh, Byrne, O’Brien, O’Connor, O’Sullivan, McCarthy, and Doyle. Weddings Our brides and grooms are getting older as the average age for brides in 2021 was 35.4 years and 37.4 for grooms in opposite-sex marriages. While the most popular form of ceremony for opposite-sex couples was a Catholic ceremony (40%), it was closely followed by civil ceremonies (34%). Deaths Cancer and circulatory disease were the biggest causes of death in Ireland, according to figures published in November 2022, accounting for 5,152 (or 55.2%) of deaths in April, May, and June (Q2) 2022 compared with 3,848 (or 57.4%) in Q2 2021. There were 1,724 deaths due to dementia in Q2 2022, of which, 1,051 (61%) were female and of the 527 deaths due to Alzheimer’s, 355 (67%) were female. COVID-19 Deaths & Vaccinations The number of deaths where COVID-19 was identified as the Underlying Cause of Death (UCOD) in 2021 was 3,011 (or 9.1% of total deaths). Our COVID-19 Vaccination Series in October revealed that just 14% of employees across all sectors were not fully vaccinated and the Accommodation & Food Services sector had the highest percentage of employees who were not fully vaccinated at 23% as of 31 August 2022. Education When it comes to educational attainment, more than half (53%) of 25–64-year-olds in 2022 have a third level education, the highest level in the EU-27. The release published in November also showed that over the last 10 years, there has been an increase in the proportion of those aged 25-64 years old with a third level education, from 40% in 2012 to 53% in 2022. A release in April showed that 80% of 2019 graduates were in substantial employment in the first year after graduation and their median or mid-point earnings was €555 per week. Our Working Life Employment A record rate of employment was recorded in Q2 2022 of 73.5% – the highest rate since the current series began in 1998. The number of people in employment increased by 3.4% to 2,554,300 in the year to Q3, while the estimated total number of hours worked per week in Q3 2022 was 80.3 million hours, up by 3.2 million hours or 4.2% on Q3 2021. The number of people employed rose by more than 650,000 over the 10 years to Q3 2022, and the number of unemployed people fell from just over 350,000 to 120,000 over the same period. Job Satisfaction According to a survey published in April, the majority of employees were satisfied with their job with more than one quarter (25.9%) saying they were very satisfied, while nearly two-thirds (63%) said they were satisfied. However, one in nine employees were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their job. Remote Working We are also changing how we work, as another survey also published in April showed that almost four in ten employees were remote working at some point during 2021, while only one in twelve (8%) workers had availed of some form of remote working pre-COVID-19. Almost three-quarters (74%) of remote workers surveyed said they felt they had more time on their hands while working remotely. Our Society Our social surveys paint a picture of how we live and how we feel. Wealth The Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2020 published in May showed the median net wealth value of Irish households was €193,100. In 2020, 97% of households had some form of savings, (deposit or savings account or positive balance on a current account) with a median value of €8,700. As of Q3 2022, Irish households were saving 19% of their income, down from 20% in Q2 2022. The release published in December noted this was still significantly higher than pre-pandemic savings levels of around 10%. Deprivation However, our most recent Survey in Income and Living Conditions (SILC) release in November painted a different picture as the proportion of people living in enforced deprivation increased from 13.8% in 2021 to 17.1% in 2022. The number of people unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm increased from 3.2% in 2021 to 7.4% in 2022, and households with at least some difficulty in making ends meet increased from 42.0% in 2021 to 49.3% in 2022. Another SILC Survey in May put the at risk of poverty rate at 11.6% in 2021, compared with 13.2% in 2020. Without COVID-19 income supports, the at risk of poverty rate would have been 19.9%. Child Deprivation A number of surveys captured the situation of lone parents, with an online CSO Pulse Survey indicating that 41% of lone parents reporting feeling lonely all or most of the time. Figures published in October 2022 showed that single-parents were more likely (12%) to be unable to afford two pairs of properly fitting shoes for their children when compared with 1% of two-parent households. Trust In June we learned that of respondents to a Pulse Survey who lived alone, 92% said they felt safe and secure in their home, while 83% said they have someone to count on if they had a serious personal problem. A separate Trust Survey published in March found that almost three in four (74%) respondents aged 65 and over were very comfortable with asking a neighbour to keep a set of keys to their home for emergencies. Renters More than three-quarters (76%) of respondents who lived in shared rented accommodation with non-family members said in a Pulse survey they felt like they would never be able to own their own place. Renters also featured in the child deprivation indicators publication, with almost 10% of households that rent unable to afford new clothes for their children, compared with 1% of owner-occupied households. In a separate Pulse Survey, 43% of those renting would consider emigrating to lower their cost of living while 57% of respondents aged 18 to 29 were considering it. Cost of Living Almost every respondent (94%) to a survey conducted in November and published in December said they had made cutbacks, with 62% cutting back on utilities (electricity, heating, etc.), 51% buying less fuel, and 49% not buying as much food. Younger adults were concerned they could not afford to start a family, with nearly three in ten (29%) 18-29 year olds selecting this option on the survey. It also found that men were more likely than women to ask for a pay rise to counteract cost of living increases. Lifestyle A Pulse survey in May showed that more than 40% of respondents aged 18 to 34 took up new outdoor activities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with 13% of those aged 70 and over. Among the activities proposed in the survey, participants were more likely to take up sea swimming in the West (27%) and Border regions (34%), while hill walking was the most popular activity in the Mid-West (33%), and cycling in the Mid-East (27%). Mental Health More than half of the respondents (55%) to a Pulse survey published in May reported spending more time outdoors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and of those, more than 70% realised that being in natural spaces was important to their well-being and 63% spent more time socialising outside. It found that the three main reasons to spend time outdoors in the previous six months for recreational purposes were: For mental health and well-being (76%); For physical health and exercise (75%); and ‘To get fresh air’ (73%). The majority (87%) of those who lived with a pet who responded to a Pulse survey published in June said it has a positive impact on their mental health and well-being. Crime Fraud crime rose by the highest level, up 43% or by 4,877 to 16,202 incidents in the 12 months to June 2022. Theft & Related offences also rose significantly, up 23% or by 10,559 incidents. However, the number of Homicides fell by 38% between Q2 2021 and Q2 2022, falling from 64 such deaths to 40. This was mainly driven by a fall of 17 (-53%) in Dangerous Driving Leading to Death incidents over this period. Crime detection rates were lower for most crime categories in 2021 when compared with 2020, according to figures published in November. Looking at victims of crime and suspected offenders, in 2021 56% of recorded victims of Sexual offences were aged less than 18 years when the offence occurred. For suspected offenders of sexual violence, 98% were male and 18% were aged under 18 years in 2021. Our Lives Online Digital Consumer Behaviour Our Digital Consumer Behaviour 2022 release published in December found that the most popular online purchase was still clothes, shoes, or accessories at 71%, while the numbers of people ordering ready-made food online rose to 58% in 2022, compared with 50% in 2021. Dubliners were most likely to shop online (87%), followed by persons living in the South-East (84%), while internet users living in the Midland region were the least likely (70%). Household Expenditure on Digital Services In July we learned that Irish households spent €49m on social media and dating sites in 2020, while the total household expenditure on digital services in that year was estimated at €896m. Video streaming services at €211m (24%) was the largest category of paid for digital service followed by online gaming at €137m (15%) and online gambling at €130m (15%). The UK provided more digital services to Irish households than any other country at 34% of the total spend, followed by Ireland at 15%, and The Netherlands at 13%. Information Integrity Despite the increased amount of time we spend online, less than four in ten internet users (37%) read privacy policy statements when providing personal information. Digital Transactions in the Irish Economy In November, we learned that 41% of goods and services produced in the economy were ordered or delivered online, or both, to the tune of €154bn. Some 94% of transactions in the Financial Services sector in 2020 were conducted online, and included transactions such as the provision of insurance, pensions, fund management, and online banking. Our Environment Green Energy CSO figures show the continued growth in the number of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles licensed in Ireland. The number of new electric cars licensed has increased by 82% from 8,414 in the first 11 months of 2021 to 15,291 in the same period in 2022. At the same time, the number of new diesel cars has decreased to 26,889 new diesel cars in the first 11 months of 2022 compared with 34,174 in the same period in 2021. By far the most common type of electric vehicle (EV) in 2021 was the conventional hybrid (45%), while one-third of EV owners had a fully electric EV, and more than one in five (22%) had a plug-in hybrid. However, the most common deterrento buying an EV was the purchase price (63%), 29% cited access to public charging infrastructure, while 21% said that no or limited access to home charging was an issue. Separately, in April we learned that in 2020 energy taxes on petrol were 63 cent per litre compared with 51 cent per litre on autodiesel. Energy Use Looking at electricity consumption by data centres, a release published in May showed it had increased by 32% between 2020 and 2021. The increase between January to March 2015 and October to December 2021 was 265%. A separate release in May also found that large energy users accounted for 23% of metered electricity consumption in 2021. Consumption by large energy users increased by 17% between 2020 and 2021 and by 80% between 2015 and 2021. When it comes to our homes, a detached house in 2021 used 8,039 kWh which was 56% more electricity than an apartment (5,160 kWh). Metered Electricity Consumption data showed that Dublin postal districts had the highest proportion of residential consumption in 2021 at 18%, followed by Cork (12%), Dublin county (7%), Galway (6%) and Kildare (5%). Energy Ratings Data published in September showed that A and B rated dwellings consumed more electricity than F and G rated dwellings in 2021. The lowest mean electricity consumption for F and G-rated dwellings in 2021 may indicate that factors other than energy ratings – such as disposable income, whether the house was adequately heated, and use of secondary heating fuels – may have had an impact. In October, a release showed that more than one-third (36%) of non-domestic buildings constructed between 2020 and 2022 received an A rating compared with 21% built between 2015-2019. The most energy efficient building types audited during 2009-2022 were schools and colleges with 37% awarded an A rating. In October, a release found that electricity was the main space heating fuel used in 84% of domestic dwellings where construction was completed between 2020-2022 and with a Building Energy Rating (BER) audit. Dwellings built between 2015-2019 and between 2020-2022 were considerably more energy efficient than those constructed in earlier periods. Kildare (21%), Dublin County (20%), and Meath (20%) had the highest proportion of A ratings while Leitrim had the lowest at 2%. Emissions In October, the CSO noted that greenhouse gas emissions by resident units fell 17% to 63.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on foreign air travel. However, Environmental Indicators 2022 in November found that Ireland had the second highest emissions of greenhouse gases per capita in the EU27 in 2020 at 11.6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Rivers and Land Environmental Indicators 2022 also noted that the proportion of rivers and streams in Ireland with high water quality declined from 27% between 1987-1990 to 17% in 2017-2020. Three counties each had more than 10% of the total length of rivers; Donegal (7,867km), Cork (7,584km), and Mayo (7,464km). Dublin, Longford, and Louth had the shortest total length of rivers, Separately, grasslands accounted for almost 56% of the land cover in Ireland, much higher than the EU average of 10%. Donegal was the county with the lowest coverage of grasslands and croplands, at less than 40%, while Meath and Monaghan had more than 90%. Looking at land protection, herbicides were the main type of plant protection product sold in Ireland in 2020. A release published in July showed that total fertiliser sales increased by 6% in 2021 to 1.7 million tonnes, while sales of lime sales increased by 6% in 2021 to 1.7 million tonnes, while sales of lime sales increased by 50% in 2021 to 1.3 million tonnes.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Varadkar predicts tech sector will continue to grow in medium term',\n",
       "  'text': 'The tech sector will continue to grow in the medium term despite job losses being announced last year, the Taoiseach has predicted. In a briefing for political journalists Leo Varadkar said that a “slightly more positive picture” emerged around the sector in the run-in to Christmas after announcements that Meta, Stripe, Twitter, Intel and others had signalled layoffs or temporary furloughing of workers in the autumn. He said after a difficult autumn period there were no “early warnings at the moment of digital job losses”. “The tech sector is downsizing internationally; we’re not going to be immune from that here,” Mr Varadkar said. “A slightly more positive picture (has emerged) perhaps (in) the last few weeks than would have been the case six or 12 weeks ago,” he said, adding that a lot of tech companies were still recruiting. “It’s a situation that we’ll obviously be keeping under review, I’m certain, though, that in the medium to long term we’re going to see further growth in the tech sector. The future is digital. All of those technologies we’re going to see more of in the future, not less,” he said, arguing that Leaving Cert students and school-leavers should strongly consider science, technology, maths and engineering “because there’s going to be more jobs in those areas, not less”. Last month Mr Varadkar conceded that the housing crisis was a “drag” on inward investment, which is regularly raised with him by executives in multinationals during meetings when discussing potential investments in Ireland. Last week The Irish Times reported that officials in inward investment agency IDA Ireland have expressed anxiety about the impact of the housing crisis on big business, saying the lack of accommodation was “not positive” for Ireland. With building commencements slowing down in 2022 despite increased construction targets for 2023, internal records from the State’s inward investment agency show how companies raising housing issues had described an “unfavourable” situation. IDA Ireland ranks among the most powerful public agencies because of links with 1,700 international companies that employ some 300,000 people, which equates to almost 12 per cent of the State’s 2.55 million workforce. “As you can guess IDA’s clients are worried about the housing and in particular the rental situation across the country, and I [would] just like to get an update from you on where you feel our rental policy is at and any new developments,” said one email to the Department of Housing from Tommy Fanning, IDA head of strategic policy.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Many tenants overholding on properties as they can find nowhere else to go',\n",
       "  'text': 'A tenant who had been served an eviction notice for the Co Clare property in which he lived with his family said he had no place to go. Appearing before a tenancy tribunal via Microsoft Teams, the man, who had been accused of overholding by the landlord, said there were “many things wrong” with the house, such as the heating system. The family did not like the dwelling, he said, adding they were not going to stay but “cannot find anywhere” else to live. The tenant was facing a tribunal of three decision-makers in one of the final steps in the dispute-resolution process between landlords and tenants, held by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). The determination of the tribunal is binding, and can be appealed only on a point of law via the High Court. When a determination order is issued by the tribunal, it can be enforced if a party involved in the case makes an application to the District Court to make the RTB decision a court order. This, barristers working in the sector have said, is not unusual and does happen, though is not required in the majority of cases as most people comply. In the Co Clare case, heard in March 2022, the tribunal determined that the tenant and his family must vacate the dwelling within 28 days of the date of issue of the determination order. There is desperation in many of the cases heard by the tribunals, with the disputes often laying bare the extent of the housing and homelessness crisis. In May 2022, one appellant in Dublin had his appeal heard by a tribunal after he was served an eviction notice. Despite viewing 10 properties, he said he could not find alternative accommodation. The tenant, who was accused of overholding, said he believed he was competing with about 800 other people for each property he attempted to rent. He had two young children who were attending a school near the dwelling, he said, adding that a move to alternative accommodation would involve a change of school which would cause upset to his children. The tribunal determined that the tenant must vacate and give up possession of the dwelling within a 42 days of the date of issue of the determination order. The Irish Times analysed the almost 400 RTB tribunal reports and determination orders that were published in 2022. The reports detailed the disputes arising between tenants and landlords, or, in some cases, third parties who claimed to be affected by a tenancy. According to the RTB’s data, rent arrears and overholding were the most frequent dispute types reported in 2021, accounting for 31 per cent of all complaints made that year. The second most common reason reported was deposit retention (19 per cent of cases), followed by validity of notice of termination (17 per cent of cases) and a breach of landlord obligations (17 per cent of cases). A breakdown of figures for 2022 is awaited. Overholding The issue of overholding frequently results from a fear of becoming homeless, according to the evidence provided by tenants during the tribunals. In another case, heard by the tribunal in March, the tenant’s representative said they were making “every effort to find new accommodation and getting in contact with the correct people but that it had not yet succeeded”. The landlord in the same case said he required the dwelling for his own needs. His children shared a bedroom with him following the breakdown of his marriage, he said, and he had difficulties in terms of mortgage arrears. In Mayo, a tenant who lived in a rented home with her three children said if she was evicted she and her family would be homeless. She told the tribunal in February that she was doing her best and was not overholding deliberately. In April 2022, a couple renting a Dublin home, who had been served a notice of termination, told the tribunal they were in the process of purchasing their own house. They had paid a deposit for the property in February 2021, but “due to the imposition of Covid restrictions, labour shortages and supply issues the construction of the house was delayed” but would be completed in about three months. The tenant said “due to the current housing crisis, when they received the notice of termination, their options were limited and they had to choose between being homeless or overholding”. The couple wanted to move out, he said, but “they were in an impossible situation, and it was difficult to find a short-term solution to their problem”. Sources working in the sector said while overholding is a common dispute type brought to the RTB, it can sometimes be agreed between parties that it is beneficial to take this course of action. In some cases, landlords bring the case to the RTB “out of kindness” as tenants require a determination order to get on various housing support lists, such as social housing or homeless lists, legal sources said. Meanwhile, other tenants stated they accepted and moved into dwellings with insufficient heating, mould or damp, as they had been homeless and just wanted a roof over their heads. sources working in the sector said. Later, these issues became bigger, resulting in some of them having to take a case to the RTB, complaining that their landlords had breached their obligations. Mould and damp were common issues raised by tenants to the tribunal, with at least 17 and nine complaints respectively relating to these concerns. Heating problems also featured regularly, as did broken or damaged furniture or appliances. Ann-Marie O’Reilly, national advocacy manager at Threshold, a charity advocating for rental rights, said it can be quite difficult for a renter to go to a landlord asking for repairs. Heating and boiler repairs are common issues that arise, she added. “There’s a bit of a sense among people who just want to keep their head down. What happens is people don’t say anything and they put up with things that are not okay,” she said, attributing this to the shortage of alternative accommodation options. However, these problems can then worsen as they’ve been left untreated, resulting in a bigger dispute between the two parties. Mary Conway, chairwoman of the Irish Property Owners’ Association, said the current legislation and tax on rental income are the reasons behind landlords leaving the sector Many tenants taking appeals were immigrants, the analysis of the tribunal filings show. Ms O’Reilly said there is potential for migrants to be more vulnerable in this regard, as they may not understand their rights under tenancy laws. “Maybe they’re more likely to challenge things or they don’t have a choice. While it is very difficult to find alternative accommodation for everyone, if you’re not from here and maybe don’t have family or friends with their ear to the ground, maybe you’re left with no choice but to challenge things and hold on to what you have,” she added. One significant change in recent years, Ms O’Reilly said, is the number of cases in which a notice of termination is served because of a landlord’s intention to sell the property. Previously, she said, a lot of these notices would have been deemed invalid. Now, however, the majority of landlords who issue a notice for this reason are found to have a genuine intention to sell. This is reflected in RTB figures, which show 43,000 landlords left the private rental market over the past five years. Adding to this, a quarter of small landlords are likely or very likely to sell their rental properties in the next five years, according to research done by the board. Tom Dunne, chairman of the RTB, recently told a meeting of the Oireachtas housing committee that this shift could be attributed to people who bought properties during the Celtic Tiger, rented them out when they upsized, but have now sold them on as they are no longer in negative equity. However, Mary Conway, chairwoman of the Irish Property Owners’ Association, said the current legislation and tax on rental income are the reasons behind landlords leaving the sector. “For the most part, tenants are absolutely fine. Generally, the reason is the legislation, the RTB and the tax and how long it takes to get in and get things sorted out with regards to overholding,” she said. “Before you actually get to the RTB at all, it could be six months. So you’re already down six months [rent payments] at that stage. I don’t think tenants want to default on their rent. People can fall on hardship.” Under law, if rent arrears arise, a landlord must present the tenant with a written arrears warning notice of a minimum of 28 days. If the arrears are not being paid off during that time, a notice of termination can then be issued, equalling an additional 28 days. If one of the parties decides to then take a case to the RTB, that results in things being delayed further. The average processing time for an initial hearing of a complaint was 19.5 weeks in 2021, while the processing time for tribunals, the next step if the case is appealed, was 33.4 weeks. A spokesman for the RTB said while the body “adapted speedily and implemented changes to processes to maintain services during the pandemic, the impact of Covid-19 inevitably created a backlog of cases”. In 2022, the body has also seen an increase in the volume of applications for dispute resolution, the spokesman said, which will also have an impact on processing times. Most small landlords, 94 per cent, are part-time and do not manage properties as their primary occupation, a 2022 survey by the RTB found. According to Ms Conway, this means margins are small, with many renting out the property only to cover their mortgage. This creates difficult financial situations when tenants stop paying, she said, adding that mortgage arrears become a real concern. Many tenants who fell into rent arrears and who appeared before a tenancy tribunal spoke about falling into financial hardship, with a significant proportion attributing this hardship to job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic. The extent of arrears varied significantly, according to the tribunal reports. Some landlords were owed one month’s rent, while others had accumulated arrears in excess of €25,000. The highest level of arrears recorded in the reports was €60,000. Ms Conway said 99.9 per cent of the time when a tribunal determines that a landlord is due the rent arrears, they do not receive it. She said: “If they didn’t have the money to pay initially, where are they going to get it to backpay? Landlords tend to just accept the losses. How can they pay for it, if they don’t have it?”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Cost of building hundreds of schools soars amid construction inflation',\n",
       "  'text': 'Soaring inflation in the construction sector is making it difficult for contractors to stand over tendered costs for delivering hundreds of school-building projects. Department of Education records show there are more than 300 school building-projects under construction, along with a continuous stream of other projects at or near tendering stage. Internal records released under the Freedom of Information Act flag concerns over project delays and construction inflation linked to the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and “challenging market conditions”. During the first half of last year the Department of Education was forced to increase its basic building costs by 21 per cent based on reviews of actual tender outcomes. This forced the department to seek an additional capital allocation of €300 million during 2022 to meet “significant budgetary pressures” linked to the rising cost of construction, as well as the need to accelerate school accommodation for children with special needs and young people from Ukraine. Of the hundreds of school-construction projects under way they include in excess of 50 new or replacement school buildings and 300 extensions to existing schools, the majority of which are due to be completed by the end of 2023. When asked if projects will be delayed due to rising construction costs and other factors, a spokesman for the department said a €860 million capital allocation in 2023 provided a platform for “strong roll-out” of school-building projects. He said this investment would also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050. “The Department of Education has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school-building programme. There are currently in excess of 300 school-building projects at construction, with other projects in design and at or near the tendering stage.” The spokesman said inflation has created challenges in the construction sector, and the schools sector was no different. “There are central arrangements in place for dealing with inflation which are reflected in the co-operation framework for inflation which was announced by Government earlier this year. This framework provides clarity for contractors when tendering for public works contracts.” He added that the status of all projects were listed on a county by county basis at www.gov.ie. and was updated on a regular basis to reflect their progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction. Special education, meanwhile, was a driver of increased school-construction costs last year. Moves to ensure 900 children with special education needs had access to an appropriate school place required additional investment of €100 million. This was achieved through 83 projects involving mainly modular accommodation. There are also big pressures on the special education front at post-primary level and in large urban centres at primary level, with assessments of needs backlogs and increased evidence of autism. While most Ukrainian pupils are being accommodated within existing schools, the greatest pressure on capacity is at post-primary level where student numbers are rising and there remain significant special needs capacity deficits. A total of €55 million was required for 45 projects at second level to cater to these additional Ukrainian enrolments.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Nearly 700 forestry road licences issued in Ireland',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) has issued an estimated 695 forestry road licences to date, latest figures indicate. Construction of forest roads is exempt from the planning system unless it connects to a public road. According to DAFM, all forest road construction “must be built in a manner that protects water quality and in accordance with the National Council for Forest Research and Development (COFORD) Forest Road Manual (2006) “. This outlines that roadside drainage “must not be allowed to discharge directly into natural watercourses and should be allowed to run out through buffer strips”. All forest road construction projects must secure a licence and the written consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. These regulations apply to the entire forest road project and also govern access to and from public roads. The government is currently in the process of “considering and integrating feedback from stakeholders and the public” following the public consultation on the proposed new €1.3 billion Forestry Programme for 2023-2027. The new programme intends to increase premiums for planting trees by between 46% and 66% and to extend the premium period from 15 to 20 years for farmers. DAFM has outlined that the programme “will cover all costs to establish a forest”, and depending on the type of forest, could pay landowners more than €1,100/ha for up to 20 years. The programme will be 100% exchequer funded but is subject to state-aid approval by the European Commission. According to DAFM, the programme “will come into force in early 2023” once approval is secured from the commission. State aid guidelines in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas expired on December 31, 2022 and are scheduled to be replaced with a revised version this month. The Irish government cannot submit a formal application for state aid in relation to the new forestry programme until the revised guidelines are in place. Interim forestry scheme Agriculture minister, Charlie McConalogue has confirmed that his department is “engaged” with the commission wich has “facilitated the submission of a pre-notification for this state aid in November ahead of the formal submission for January 2023”. The minister said that DAFM continues to engage bilaterally with the relevant directorate generals in the commission “in order to advance the state aid approval”. In the meantime Minister McConalogue has approved an interim afforestation scheme and an interim forest road scheme based on the De Minimis rule which effectively makes them exempt from state aid rules. In a letter to all registered foresters and other stakeholders, DAFM said that these schemes are being offered to applicants who held “a valid technical approval for afforestation or roads” on December, 31 2022 – but had not commenced work on planting or road construction in 2022, and did not wish to wait until the launch of the Forestry Programme 2023–2027. However the department has stressed that if anyone opts to take part in the interim schemes they will not be permitted to “revert” to the new forestry programme once it is in place. For landowners who may already have a valid technical approval in place for afforestation or a road scheme but who had not commenced work in 2022, they now, according to DAFM, have the option of: Postponing planting or road construction until the launch of the new Forestry Programme 2023-2027 and opting into the new programme;Opting into the interim afforestation/forest road schemes (on the De Minimis basis) with the grants and premiums payable for these schemes outlined in the proposed grants and premiums detailed in the Forestry Programme 2023–2027. However, if someone with a valid approval wants to wait until the launch of new forestry programme, then the department has said they do not have to take any further action at this time.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Construction and Farming sectors account for almost three quarters of all work-related fatalities Provisional data from the Health & Safety Authority (HAS) shows that 26 people lost their lives in work-related incidents in 2022 compared to 38 in 2021, representing the lowest figure recorded since the Authority was established over thirty years ago. Summary of statistics reported by HSA are as follows: Fatal incidents happened to victims from all age groups, the highest number involved people between 55-64 years with 10 fatalities The age groups 55-64 and 65 years and over represents 69% of all fatalities in 2022, with these age groups representing 19% of employees in Ireland (CSO figures up to end of Q3 2022) Falling from height (9 fatalities) and loss of control of a vehicle or its attachments (7 fatalities) were the leading causes of work-related fatalities in 2022 Farming saw 12 fatalities recorded in 2022 compared to 10 in 2021, with it remaining the sector with the highest number of fatalities Dublin, Galway and Wexford recorded the highest level of fatalities with three in each county No fatalities were recorded in 2022 in counties Carlow, Clare, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Sligo and Wicklow Of the 26 fatalities in 2022, 10 were employees, 13 were self-employed and 3 were non-workers Of the 26 fatalities in 2022, 25 were Male and 1 was Female The transport and storage sector recorded a decline of 83% with one fatality in 2022, compared to six in 2021 Manufacturing recorded no fatalities in 2022, compared to five in 2021 Releasing provisional annual statistics for 2022, the Health and Safety Authority welcomed a decline of over 30% to 26 work-related fatalities in 2022 from 38 in 2021, the lowest figure recorded since the Authority was established. This decline comes against a 3.4% increase in employment figures (Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021). While the confirmed number of work-related fatalities this year is the lowest recorded, it is important to point out that there are ongoing investigations that may see the reported/recorded number of fatalities increase. Commenting on the HSA’s provisional data on fatalities in Irish workplaces, Mark Cullen, Interim Chief Executive at the Health and Safety Authority said, “It is positive to see such a substantial decline in work-related fatalities in 2022. However, our view is that every work-related death is preventable and vigilance around health and safety in Irish workplaces is still imperative. Christmas this year for the families and friends of all those killed in workplace incidents will have been a difficult one and our thoughts are with them”. The HSA reports show that falling from height (9 fatalities) and loss of control of a vehicle or its attachments (7 fatalities) were the leading causes of work-related fatalities in 2022. Mark added: “We see a large number of fatalities relating to working at height and vehicle handling. We also know from the data that the age groups 55 and over represents 69% of all fatalities in 2022, with these age groups representing 19% of employees in Ireland. As Ireland’s labour force is aging, we must all look to our work place practices, and ensure that health and safety is being prioritised across all workforce age groups.” Farming continues to be one of the most dangerous sectors in which to work, and sees an increase with 12 fatalities recorded in 2022 compared to 10 in 2021. “We are urging employers and their workers to think about the task you’re asking others to carry out, or that you are about to undertake. Complete a risk assessment and make sure the right precautions are in place and nobody is putting themselves or others in danger. As evident in our records for 2022, if working with heavy machinery or at a height, be particularly vigilant and take the appropriate care”. In relation to the construction sector which saw a decline in fatalities in 2022, Mark said, “The construction sector saw a decline of 30% with 7 fatalities in 2022 compared to ten in 2021. We welcome this lower number, but are all too aware of this industry being one of the most dangerous. We would ask that smaller sites and contractors in particular continue to ensure that their own and their workers’ safety is a priority every day.” The Health and Safety Authority has guidance and supports available across industry sectors in Ireland and the www.BeSMART.ie tool is freely available to employers and employees.

       "  'title': 'Homelessness record broken again as 11,542 people in emergency accommodation in November',\n",
       "  'text': 'THE NUMBER OF people experiencing homelessness in Ireland has once again hit a record high with latest government figures showing that 11,542 people were living in emergency accommodation in November. It is the fifth consecutive month that the record number has been broken. A total of 5,423 single adults, 1,371 young people and 3,494 children were living in emergency accommodation between 21 and 27 November. It means that 145 more people were living in emergency accommodation in November of last year than the previous month. The figures also represent a 26.85% increase in homelessness compared to the same time period last year. There was also a record high number of young people, aged 18-24, in emergency accommodation in November. Simon Communities of Ireland Executive Director Wayne Stanley said that the government’s decision to introduce a moratorium on evictions over winter was an “important step”, but that unless more secure accommodation can be provided throughout 2023, Ireland may face ongoing extensions and renewals of the eviction ban. Stanley warned that this would not be a “long-term solution”, and added that Ireland needs to see “innovation” in housing provision this year, including driving forward with the focus on rapid build homes. “It is timely to reflect that 11,542 people living in emergency accommodation only a year ago seemed unthinkable,” he said. “2023 needs to be a year of delivery for those at the sharpest end of the ongoing housing crisis or we will see the unthinkable surpassed and redefined each month.” He also called on the government to insert a right to housing into the Irish constitution. ‘Tragedy’ In Dublin, 1,134 families were in emergency accommodation in November, including 2,549 children. The CEO of Dublin Simon Community Catherine Kenny said that they are “dismayed” to see that, for a seventh month in a row, “we have broken the record for the highest number of people ever recorded in homelessness in the capital”. “These spiralling figures convey nothing short of a tragedy,” she added. Kenny further noted that these figures do not include those sleeping rough, staying in domestic violence refuges or the hidden homeless population. She said that it is especially concerning to see an older cohort of people presenting to emergency accommodation services in Dublin. “In the last 12 months, the number of people aged 65 and older entering into emergency accommodation has grown by\\u202f36%. Over the same period, the number of people aged between 45 and 64 entering into emergency accommodation has grown by\\u202f25%. “Their fear is palpable as they try to cope with the stark reality of becoming homeless in older age, and are faced with navigating a very complex system. As we enter into a new year, many will worry what will become of them,” she said. Kenny called on the government to take radical action to tackle the homelessness crisis, adding that it is “simply unacceptable in a first world country with a successful economy”. Focus Ireland CEO Pat Dennigan said that while the charity welcomed commitments to address the homelessness crisis, “we need to see those words turned into urgent action”. “2,706 new build social homes were delivered between January and September 2022, and while final figures for 2022 will not be released until March, Minister O’Brien has said that most newly built social homes were completed towards the end of 2023. “The minister has indicated that last year more social homes were built than for very many years, which would mean that local authorities could be allocating upwards of 3,000 new social homes over the next few months,” he said. Dennigan said that the onus is on the Government to ensure that these homes are allocated in a way that creates a fair balance between the families who have spent years on the waiting list living in unsuitable conditions, and those who are trapped in homelessness, but have not been registered for so long. ‘We can no longer rely on the private sector’ Analysis by Focus Ireland suggests that the current winter eviction ban will have a much more limited impact on homelessness than the Covid-19 eviction ban, which saw figures drop almost 20%. Dennigan explained that this is because during the Covid-19 eviction ban, as well as fewer families becoming homeless, there was an increase in families moving out of homelessness as private rental properties became available on the market. Focus Ireland does not expect that to see an increase in families moving out of homelessness during the winter eviction ban as “we can no longer rely on private sector to provide a route out of homelessness”. Dennigan stressed the importance that this places on new social housing units over the next few months. He also said that it is highly concerning that a large number of families and single families have now been in emergency accommodation for over two years. “This is unacceptable. It’s important to remember that when we discuss these figures we are talking about human beings struggling every day and the trauma of long-term homelessness can leave a lasting trauma long after they finally find a home,” he said. Dennigan said that if the eviction ban is lifted in April, we will face a wave of Spring evictions, “with no emergency accommodation available” for the people affected. He said that the Housing Minister needs to take measures to encourage landlords not to sell up, and that constructive engagement is needed with the over 1,000 landlords who have already issued notice of terminations, and are currently waiting for the eviction ban to lift before they sell up.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Citigroup signs deal for new European HQ in Dublin docklands',\n",
       "  'text': 'Citigroup has signed for a new headquarters in Dublin, in a timely boost for the office market in the capital. The US lender has agreed a €300 million deal for a new office campus in the city’s north docklands. The deal with Johnny Ronan’s RGRE for the delivery of 300,000sq ft (27,870sq m) of office space at the developer’s Waterfront South Central site was concluded in the week leading up to Christmas. Citi is understood to be paying about €100 million to acquire the site with a further €200 million being set aside for the construction of its new base. Due for completion in 2026, the bank’s proposed footprint will equate to roughly 70 per cent of the 430,000sq ft of office accommodation RGRE intends to develop as part of the wider north docklands scheme. News of the agreement should provide something of a fillip for the capital’s commercial property sector coming as it does at a turbulent time for the global tech companies whose requirements have driven much of the demand for office space in the Dublin market over recent years. Facebook’s decision not to occupy the four blocks developed for it by RGRE at its new Ballsbridge campus has, for instance, brought 34,838sq m (375,000sq ft) of office space back to the letting market while LinkedIn’s decision last October to seek an alternative occupier for two blocks under development at its new European headquarters in Wilton Park have added a further 265,000sq ft to the city’s available office stock. Firms took up about 206,000sq m of office space in Dublin during 2022, CBRE said in a statement on Friday. That was an increase of about 35 per cent year on year. Still, it is about two-thirds the amount of space taken up in 2019 before the pandemic struck. It remains to be seen meanwhile, what impact, if any, Salesforce’s announcement earlier this week to cut its global workforce by 10 per cent will have on its office accommodation requirements in Dublin. The company is due to move into its newly developed European headquarters at Spencer Place in the city’s north docklands in March. Developed by RGRE, the campus extends to 40,041sq m (431,000sq ft) and comprises three office buildings along with a 204-bedroom hotel let to Ireland’s largest hotel operator, Dalata Hotel Group. While Salesforce signalled its intention this week to reduce its office footprint globally by setting aside $450 million-$650 million for what it describes as “exit charges associated with office space reductions”, in the case of Dublin, much of the heavy lifting may already have been done. As reported by The Irish Times in December, SMBC Aviation Capital has agreed a deal for all 135,617sq ft of space at Fitzwilliam 28, the newly developed office block which Slack Technologies had signed for in early 2020. That plan was abandoned when Slack was acquired subsequently for €27.7 billion by Salesforce. Slack’s entire operations will now be located at Salesforce’s new European headquarters at Spencer Place.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Glenveagh setback this week may open up opportunity for rival Cairn',\n",
       "  'text': 'Glenveagh Properties, one of the worst performing stocks on the Iseq 20 last year as it lost close to a third of its value, had a stab at a rally in the first days of trading in 2023. It didn’t last long. A trading statement from the home builder on Thursday sent the stock tumbling as much as 10 per cent on the day, as it downgraded its forecast for suburban house completions this year by 20 per cent to about 1,350 units – citing “near-term gridlock” in the planning system at a time when supply is continuing to fall well short of demand in the State and the housing crisis is supposed to be a top Government priority. Back in September, Glenveagh said it had planning in place for 80 per cent of the 1,700 homes it then aimed to complete this year, and that it expected to receive the go-ahead from An Bord Pleanála (ABP) on the remaining 20 per cent during the fourth quarter. None of the anticipated approvals came through. Just days before Christmas, ABP issued an apology for ongoing delays in issuing planning decisions, admitting it was not meeting “statutory objective time frames for decisions for a large number” of cases. The embattled planning body also highlighted that its board, which takes decisions on appeals or applications, was operating with half of its standard complement of 10 members. Glenveagh, led by chief executive Stephen Garvey, used the trading statement to urge planning system reform be “expedited to solve the longer term structural supply issues the sector faces”. The outline of draft legislation published last month has the object of, among other things, recasting ABP under a new name and decision-making structure, and tightening the time frames for judicial reviews of planning decisions, in an effort to avoid projects being bogged down in legal proceedings. The Government aims to enact the planned laws “in early 2023”. But it is no quick fix. While the Government has a target for an average of 33,000 homes to be built every year until 2030, Davy analyst Conall Mac Coille estimates house completions will actually fall this year to 27,000 from 28,400 in 2022. Glenveagh has long set its sights on becoming the biggest housebuilder in the State, and to be churning out 3,000 homes by 2024. Peer Cairn’s aim is to deliver 5,000-5,500 homes in the three years to 2024, which, when factoring in the 1,500 units factored in for last year, points to a more manageable average of 1,750-2,000 for this year and next. Some 2,000 of Glenveagh’s 2024 target is forecast to come from building houses, mainly in the Dublin commuter belt, with the rest coming from building urban apartments for investment firms involved in the private rental sector (PRS) and a new line of business developing social and affordable units in partnership with local authorities and State agencies. Glenveagh has enough to be getting on with, for now, on the urban front – having agreed forward funding deals last year to develop projects in the Citywest, Castleknock, Blackrock and north docklands areas of Dublin, totalling more than €310 million. However, this line of business has become increasingly challenged over the past six months, as overseas money that flooded into the sector in recent years – including German and Dutch pension funds – has all but dried up since the European Central Bank (ECB) started to jack up interest rates. “There is a real viability issue in PRS at the moment,” said Colin Sheridan, an analyst with Davy. “Buyers that were in the market in recent years were buying at rental yields of as low as 3.6 per cent in prime areas... Even if PRS investors come back to the market, they’ll be demanding higher yields than they previously had accepted.” Jonathan Coubrough, an analyst with London brokerage Numis, noted to clients that Glenveagh was struggling to scale up its business as quickly as it would have liked. “We see further timing risk here,” he said, reiterating his reduce recommendation – the equivalent of a sell – on the stock. Barclays analyst Celine Soo-Huynh was more upbeat, saying “fundamentals are expected to remain resilient” this year, with house price inflation expected to amount to 6 per cent, while construction cost inflation, which had hit the construction sector hard last year, should also ease. Irish lenders have largely lagged behind European peers in passing on ECB rate hikes. “The 30 per cent presale on the units completing in 2023 is lower than the year prior, but management expects the recent announcements by the [Central] Bank of Ireland on less restrictive mortgage requirements, as well as a supportive Irish housing policy, to still fuel demand for new homes,” she said. This time last year, Glenveagh had already signed up buyers for almost 45 per cent of the owner occupier homes it ended up completing last year. Some believe that Cairn – which had a head start on accumulating its land bank following the crash and floating on the stock market – should break away from its arch-rival in the eyes of investors. Shares in Cairn, trading at 91 cent in Dublin on Friday afternoon, and Glenveagh, changing hands at under 87c, are well below their respective €1 initial public offering prices. Could a scheduled trading statement from Cairn on Monday morning be a catalyst? “Cairn is in a more advantageous position from a planning perspective – with 90 per cent of its guided unit volumes to 2024 having full planning permission,” said Shane Carberry, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers. The overriding ambition of both housebuilders is to deliver profit returns by 2024 that are the equivalent of 15 per cent of shareholders’ equity. Glenveagh has more work to do, with its estimated return on equity last year of 7 per cent below Cairn’s 11 per cent target. Glenveagh has been relying more heavily on share buy-backs and to get there, having repurchased and cancelled close to €254 million of its stock over the past years (helped by money received from the forward sale of apartment schemes). It announced on Thursday that it planned to repurchase a further 10 per cent of its stock – which equates to €55 million based on its current share price. More buy-backs may be in store if it fails to deliver on hitting ambitious building targets.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Immunologist says stronger advice on mask-wearing needed amid surge in respiratory viruses',\n",
       "  'text': 'AN IMMUNOLOGIST HAS said that the Government “missed a trick” by not strongly advising the public of the importance of wearing masks before the current winter surge that is seeing record hospital overcrowding due to a rise in respiratory illnesses. Professor Christine Loscher told The Journal that while the current public health advice doesn’t need to be changed, there needs to be more communication on the effectiveness of mask-wearing in preventing the spread of Covid-19 and influenza. The health service is coming under an increasing amount of pressure at the moment due to the number of patients presenting with respiratory viruses. While Covid and RSV are significant factors, officials have singled out influenza as being of particular concern, with cases increasing rapidly and no clear indication of when they might peak. On Tuesday, a record 931 patients were without beds in Irish hospitals, the highest figure ever recorded by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO). While that figure has reduced in recent days, the interim CEO of the HSE, Stephen Mulvany, has said that despite this week being the worst on record for hospital overcrowding, he cannot say for certain that “it won’t get worse before it gets better”. Mask wearing Speaking to The Journal, Dr Christine Loscher said: “I think that we missed a trick in that we should have been getting the public on board with the fact that when things surge, we could do something to help the situation, and that this is what we should have been doing all along.” “Now we’re not just dealing with Covid, but we’re dealing with RSV and the flu,” she said, adding that she doesn’t know whether the public “are as on board as we need them to be” with the public health advice because of a lack of messaging and not being used to following the advice since restrictions were lifted. “We have evidence from the last couple of winters that when we do behave differently, we also impact on those viruses. There needs to be very strong advice that we should wear masks on public transport and in crowded indoor, poorly ventilated spaces at the moment, in order to reduce everyone’s risk.” Currently, the public health advice on mask-wearing is that while they are no longer mandatory, masks are still advised on public transport and in healthcare settings such as hospitals and GP surgeries. Call for mask mandate But last week, the INMO called on the Government to “make difficult decisions including the return of mandated mask-wearing in congregated settings” in an effort to reduce the spread of respiratory infections. “We know that one of the main pressure points in our health service is the rise of respiratory infections. Asking people to return to mask-wearing in busy congregated settings is a simple measure,” Phil Ní Sheaghdha, general secretary of the INMO, said. However, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has said that the official advice to Government is that mask mandates are not required. “I don’t anticipate any change coming in terms of the public health advice from the Chief Medical Officer,” Donnelly said. “However, I want to fully acknowledge the INMO’s concerns, I think they are playing a very constructive role. I got a letter in from them today, we had a good chat earlier on today. They’re looking for solutions,” Donnelly said. “The public health advice to Government, to me at the moment, it is not a move to mask mandates, but obviously we will keep the situation under review on a daily and on a weekly basis.” Loscher is not in favour of introducing a mask mandate, and believes that issuing stronger advice is the way to go. “We’ve missed the boat on forming that habit, now we’re in dire straits and we need people to respond. I can totally understand the INMO calling for a mandate because they’re the frontline dealing with the desperate situation that everyone’s in at the moment,” she said. “Mandates come with controversy; it ends up being huge discussions, whereas I think that it needs to be, again, reiterating the benefits to people of infection control using masks, hand washing and sanitising.” At a briefing on Tuesday, the Government said flu cases are much higher than in previous years, with the number of people being hospitalised more than doubled compared to pre-Covid. Flu vaccines Compared to 2019, there were 2,331 lab confirmed cases of flu identified up to Christmas week. This is in contrast to 1,000 cases in 2019. Of the 2,331 cases, a total of 637 people hospitalised which compared to 350 people on past figures. Loscher said the current flu season still hasn’t peaked and that there’s “still an awful lot of people out there who will get the flu”. There is no doubt that when we were wearing masks in the context of Covid, that it did have a huge impact in terms of the incidence of things like flu and other respiratory viruses. She previously told The Journal that she would have liked to have seen flu vaccines free for everyone the way they were in the last few years. The vaccine is currently free for people aged 65 and over, children aged 2-17, healthcare workers and people with long-term health conditions. She said that by making the flu vaccine free for all age cohorts, it is likely to improve the uptake of the vaccine and reduce the spread of the virus. “If you want people to behave a certain way, you’ve got to make it easy for them. When you put barriers in the way like increased costs, I think it really impacts on people engaging with them anymore,” she said. Attitude towards masks While more people have been visibly wearing face masks on public transport and in crowded settings in recent weeks, the vast majority of people are not wearing one. Pete Lunn, the head of behavioural research at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), told The Journal that it is unlikely that there will be a significant increase in mask-wearing under the current guidance. “When the mandate was lifted for masks on public transport and in some other public settings, there was a very rapid fall-off in people wearing them. There is a very big difference between having a rule and something being guidance, however strong that guidance is,” Lunn said. “Part of the reason for this is that because mask-wearing is very much a collective activity, people tend to do it much more when they see that other people are doing it too. The existence of a rule really, really drives up the proportion of people who are wearing masks. And when you take the rule away, even if it remains guidance, as soon as people see that some other people aren’t doing it, the numbers doing it drop. From a behavioural science point of view, essentially you move from an equilibrium where people are cooperating with each other because they can see other people are doing it – to a situation where because a lot of people aren’t doing it, the people who would cooperate don’t, because they can’t see why they should bother if other people aren’t bothering. “You end up with a minority doing it, who are the ones who are perhaps most at risk or ones that believe in it most, or whatever it happens to be, but you get a really big change. “If I’m honest, I think it would be very difficult to get mask-wearing back up to a high level again purely through voluntary guidance. Ultimately, it’s going to take a decision to say: ‘Look, there is a mandate in these circumstances, this is what everyone has to do.’” Lunn said that were a mask mandate to be introduced, it is difficult to know what the public response would be. “In the past, whenever we’ve introduced genuine rules about this, the very large majority of people stuck to it,” he said. “I think it’s pretty clear to everyone at this stage that we have a problem. Given what they’re seeing on the news and given the way people have responded in the past to pressure on the hospitals and rises in case numbers, I would anticipate that if we strengthen the rules surrounding wearing masks, that more people will wear them and we’ll get pretty high compliance, but I can’t be sure about that.” Loscher said that while it is possible that people may not resume wearing masks at the level previously seen, a strong message from Government could still see an increase in the number of people following the public health advice. “One way of changing behaviour is to make it mandatory. We all know that when people have to comply, they will. I think the reason that maybe the uptake on mask wearing won’t be as much as it could have been, is because this is what we should have been doing over the last few cycles of Covid so that people are used to: ‘This is what we do when we get a surge and the healthcare sector is impacted’,” she said. “I do think there’s lots of very small things that we can do, and that will help, but I think it’s about the Government and the HSE coming out and asking people to help support the healthcare sector and the healthcare workers at the moment by doing that range of things where they can. That message is very strong, and I think that’s a message that people respond to very well.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Increase in online shopping prompts spike in demand for warehouse space in Limerick',\n",
       "  'text': 'AN INCREASE in online shopping has resulted in a spike in demand for warehousing space in Limerick. That\\'s according to two leading city auctioneers, who have expressed positivity in the commercial sector as the local and national economy recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic last year. Tom Crosse, GVM Auctioneers and Gordon Kearney, Rooney Auctioneers, have also reported that despite another impact of the coronavirus lockdown - that of working from home - demand for office space in the city remains high. Mr Crosse, who trades in Glentworth Street in the city, said: \"The warehousing market has been the big winner with all historically vacant units now occupied with new suitors either as purchase or investors.\" The demand for this type of space is not just because of a rise in online shopping, but also substantial price increases in Dublin, and the comparative lack of warehousing stock in the regions, he added. [articlepreview id=\"1004814\" link=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/1004814/have-property-prices-peaked-limerick-estate-agents-reflect-on-2022-and-look-at-the-year-ahead.html\"] Contributing to this, Mr Kearney said: \"There has been extremely low levels of construction of new warehouse and industrial space resulting in existing stock being in high demand with competitive biddings on most sales throughout the year.\" One thing which has impacted across the board when it comes to property, both residential and commercial, has been the rise in construction costs - both labour and materials. Mr Kearney, whose auctioneering firm is located in the city centre\\'s O\\'Connell Street, said it led to demand for development land dropping last year. But sales of commercial interest properties were very active in the first six months of 2022, something he puts down to negative interest rates being applied to large deposits held in banks. \"Large depositors sought a better return on their deposits and invested heavily in commercial investment properties and land,\" he explained. \"However, since positive interest rates have now returned, activity levels on commercial investment properties have waned somewhat.\" Mr Crosse says there has been a \"very robust\" local commercial market this year, with rental for office space up around 10% year-on-year. \"Rental levels in business parks is ranging from €15 to €20 per square foot with good grade A space in the city centre averaging €25 per square foot. “There appears to be growing interest in the good quality accommodation,\" he added. [articlepreview id=\"1004917\" link=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/1004917/limerick-people-urged-to-run-or-walk-to-support-work-of-milford-care-centre.html\"] In terms of commercial sales, GVM notably sold development sites in Kildare town centre - which will be used for a school - and land for a shopping arcade in Tullamore, Co Offaly. In October last, the flagship tenant at the city\\'s Opera Centre development, Revenue, admitted it would be reconsidering the number of people it planned to work at the heart of the space due to the rise in the number of people working-from-home.

The number of products unavailable to Irish doctors and pharmacies to treat patients has jumped by more than 15 per cent over the past month. Dominic Coyle has the details. More than 1,000 Irish businesses could go to the wall this year, costing creditors and others €3 billion-€4 billion, a report published on Monday warns. Between one and two businesses fail every day in the Republic, according to some calculations. However, a new PwC report warns that this could rise to more than 1,000 – almost three daily – this year, as the global recession bites more deeply in coming months. Barry O’Halloran reports. Emma Jacobs says it is time we culled the amount of meetings we have to attend.

       "  'title': 'Housebuilding activity contracts sharply for third month running',\n",
       "  'text': '“2022 was a year of two halves for construction,” said BNP Paribas Real Estate Ireland director and head of research, John McCartney. “Strong expansion between January and May gave way to slowing activity from June, and the year petered out with a further pronounced slowdown in December,” he said. The construction sector is in contraction territory due to “challenging economic conditions” which have hit market demand. The headwinds facing the industry include, supply chain delays, and high input prices. The fall in construction activity coincided with a reduction in new orders. New business decreased for the ninth consecutive month, and to the greatest extent since last August. This falling workload led firms to reduce staffing levels. Mr McCartney said: They initially took a wait-and-see approach to shrinking order books, maintaining their staff headcounts and continuing to purchase materials. “But after nine months of new business contraction, panelists have now begun running down stocks and not replacing employees who leave.” The survey recorded a drop in activity across the three construction categories, housing, commercial, and civil engineering. The softest fall in activity was seen on commercial projects, despite the rate of decline quickening from November. Some construction firms remain optimistic and have predicted a rise in development activity for 2023 as many expect the current economic environment to become less volatile. Mr McCartney said: Ireland’s construction firms retain a positive medium-term outlook, with a solid majority expecting to be busier this time next year. “This may reflect recent developments which should assist with current viability challenges. “Input price inflation has moderated to its slowest rate for 21 months,” he said. Mr McCartney also said the State’s Croí Cónaithe scheme will also help increase building activity as it is being implemented to subsidise apartment developments that would otherwise not be profitable to build. However, he said further government action is required if construction activity is to increase. “Relaxing mortgage restrictions and raising the shared equity scheme price ceilings, may also underpin builders’ confidence that they will be able to sell properties at prices that make development viable,” Mr McCartney said.',\n",

       "  'text': 'To put it in Michael Noonan-style parlance: the house is on fire but the lads are wondering how much use they’d get out of a hose the next day. Heartiest congratulations to the Department of Housing and all the local authorities around the country for their fiscal management this year. The gratitude of the nation too must go to 3,494 children who were homeless this Christmas for their contribution to this prudence. There was €66,000 for each one of them just sitting in the bank to build houses that never got spent. In a year when President Michael D Higgins declared a “housing disaster”, with record numbers of people in homelessness, €231m set aside for building houses went unspent. Homes, in other words, for people who are without a place to live. And that’s not an error. It’s not that there was an overspend on housing last year, when the challenges of record rent rises and 70,000 Ukrainian refugees were added into the equation. 2022 was quite the year. Remarkably, the housing budget still came in under the limit. And the kids who went homeless for Christmas because not enough houses were built – helped round up the Exchequer figures and bring in a budget surplus of €5bn. After all, a housing overspend would not have looked good on the balance sheet.And that’s what is important. The interchangeable finance ministers Michael McGrath and Paschal Donohoe were grinning away at their figures last week. The Coalition’s answer to the Kray twins are busy hoarding a pot of gold for a rainy day. The largesse of the Covid era is gone.Coming into 2023, real-world figures show a record 11,500 accommodated by homeless services near the end of 2022 – up over 25pc on the same period a year earlier. Renewed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says there are a number of pressing challenges that will define the rest of this Government’s term in office: “The first is housing.” He says the Government “must apply the same spirit of determination, action and immediacy that we saw during the pandemic to this the greatest challenge of today”.“We must do whatever it takes it solve this social crisis and reverse the trend of rising homelessness and falling homeownership. We will leave no stone unturned. No option taken off the table without due consideration,” he declared on becoming Taoiseach.This has become something of a slogan as he trotted out the same line this week when he met with a housing policy quango during the week. Due to a mix-up, Housing Minister Darragh O’Brien was curiously absent from his meeting with the Housing Commission. Varadkar has come on a bit since having a dispute with Micheál Martin around the Cabinet table about whether housing was the most important issue and whether it preceded protecting the economy. Now Varadkar is poetically promising “hope and housing”.But to “do whatever it takes” clearly doesn’t include telling councils they can go above their allocated budgets to deliver on housing targets at a time of unprecedented demand when unforeseen events occur.The fear of getting a rap across the knuckles from the department seems to outweigh any desire to “do whatever it takes”. It’s doubtful the Dáil Public Accounts Committee is going to haul a local authority chief executive across the coals for going a few million over budget in order to “do whatever it takes” to deliver houses.The warnings were there in the summer of a problem as spending was too slow. A euro in every five that was supposed to have been spent wasn’t. The blame at that point was being placed on “lower than anticipated spend on Local Authority housing due to ongoing economic issues impacting delivery” and on “wider challenges in the construction sector, including supply chain disruption”. The alarm bells were ringing loud.Come the end of the year and Donohoe is explaining that the “very high levels of inflation” had an impact on the delivery of new houses and the ability of local authorities to manage their budgets. The focus though has to be on the spending of every euro. “What myself and Minister Darragh O’Brien are aware of is the need to spend and spend well,” the public expenditure minister says.Inflation does drive prices up, making budgets harder to manage. Contracts have to be renegotiated and tenders put out again. Normally this would result in an overspend, but instead there was an underspend. The local authorities couldn’t get the housing across the line due to a shortage of manpower and supplies.But it also appears the pressure from red tape as costs increased and being afraid to go over budget, meant projects were stalled. Rather than logically going over budget – in the very year where it was most excusable – spending got postponed for another day. It was easier than getting caught over budget.During Covid-19, the coffers were thrown open, but now in the housing crisis we’re talking about watching every cent. So much for applying “the same spirit of determination, action and immediacy that we saw during the pandemic”. Nobody is suggesting the Government start burning money, but there has to be some acknowledgement that construction prices are gone up and the bang for the buck will be lessened.The slowdown in building starts is having knock-on effect for 2023 with O’Brien now admitting it will be a struggle to hit targets again this year. The excuses are already being lined up. The cycle continues. It’s not about a lack of investment. The capital spending on housing is the highest of any area of government, trumping even transport, and is at record levels. At a time when unprecedented resources are available, the Coalition literally can’t spend the money. Varadkar’s argument that delivery on housing will be the test of this Government’s success until the general election is correct. Reform of the health service, the cost of living, climate action and a potential recession shouldn’t go without a mention. The next election though will be about housing and who can show they have the solutions. Not being able to spend the funding allocated is hardly a ringing endorsement of Coalition policy.Putting out the fire can’t wait.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Fish producers welcome change to permit scheme for migrants',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Irish Fish Producers Organisation (IFPO) has welcomed the new permit scheme which will give non-EEA migrant fishers the same rights as EU crew members. IFPO chief executive, Aodh O Donnell says their members lobbied for the change and are delighted it has now finally come into effect. O Donnell says this employment permit system also offers a more streamlined process to crew members and vessel owners alike. The Department of Justice confirmed the new arrangements this week. Under the new scheme, all holders of a current valid permission to work as a non-EEA Crew member under the Atypical Working Scheme (AWS) in the Irish Fishing Fleet expiring on or after 1 January 2023 will be granted a Stamp 4 immigration permission. The new arrangements provide for legislative changes for non-EEA Crew in the Irish Fishing Fleet and to assist in the transition period to the Employment Permit system. O Donnell says this award of Stamp 4 permission is a “critical and much embraced change to the status of Crew employed in the Irish Fishing Fleet under the auspices of the problematic Atypical Working Scheme.” “Our members have worked hard with us, as a representative body, to support the right of all non-EEA migrant fishers to fair treatment and for fit for purpose permitting. This is positive news with the introduction of measures to protect migrant fishers and to grant them the full rights and entitlements under Employment legislation. This legislative change gives qualifying non-EEA crew the same full entitlements as EU crew and the option to avail of the share-based remuneration. Furthermore, the process of permitting is streamlined for both crew and vessel owners. Costs of administration are also radically reduced to the benefit of all stakeholders.” “In this regard we highly commend Minsters Charlie Mc McConalogue at the Department of Agriculture Food, and Marine and Damien English at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. They must be credited for sound leadership and for spearheading this much needed legislative initiative. In addition, we should point out that the seafood sector worked together and engaged proactively with the various government departments over the last year to deliver this outcome. The cooperation and support of the Civil Service is a paradigm for what can be achieved in the process of open, focused, and constructive engagement.” Niall Connolly Chairman of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation adds that ‘’we have been consistent in saying that our crews are the backbone of the traditional fishing activity. Ours is a professionally operated sector, committed to international best practice. These employees have valuable skill sets that are critical to our business and are much prized. We have shared goals, and we strive for continuity and international best practice’’. Barry Faulkner, Director of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation also acknowledged the support of the Minister for Marine and the delivery of an undertaking at a Protest meeting held in Kildare Stret on May 18th last year. ‘’Our vessel owners were joined in solidarity with our migrant crew colleagues to support them in a protest at Leinster House. This initiative was led by crew and skippers alike and aimed to raise awareness of much-needed legislative change to current permit schemes. The protest meeting was addressed by Minister Mc McConalogue. Whilst there are some technical implementation considerations, the Minister has delivered on an undertaking given to vessel owners and crew on that day’’. Aodh O Donnell says the “partnership with the crew members underpins the performance of our vessels to ensure a shared long-term future in a challenging international environment. This fit for purpose permit scheme is a key element of this universally welcomed change’’.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Shoppers must demand longer lasting goods and less packaging, says Fine Gael waste policy paper',\n",
       "  'text': 'Shoppers must be able to buy longer-lasting appliances and have packaging-free areas in supermarkets, a Fine Gael policy document says. The ‘circular economy’ paper also says the construction industry must improve sorting of demolition and building site waste so that materials can be reused.It urges immediate action to prevent the €700 in food waste clocked up by the average household in a year.The document comes from Fine Gael’s ‘Policy Lab’, an internal think-tank of party members and external experts.A survey conducted by the group found most people believed making changes in the goods they bought and how they used them would be difficult.Most of those quizzed had confidence they could find ways to reduce their food waste to zero and a narrow majority felt they could avoid fast fashion.But a minority felt it would be manageable for them to stop using disposable containers, avoid single use plastic, reduce their black bin waste to zero or achieve high energy efficiency in their home.Only small numbers felt they could easily downsize their home reduce energy and running costs and an even smaller proportion felt it would be possible to forgo car ownership in return for a local vehicle sharing scheme.Respondents reported poor options in their local area for the repair or upcycling of consumer goods.By contrast, two-thirds said recycling facilities were good or very good in their area but as recycling rates are not improving, that raises questions as to why those facilities are not being used more.The document, which echoes Green Party policies, comes as Green Minister for the Circular Economy, Oisín Smyth, works on drawing up waste reduction, recycling and reusability targets for business and industry.Most sectors have a mountain to climb.The construction industry in Ireland produces 9 million tonnes of waste per year and has a recycling rate of just 10pc.Around 170,000 tonnes of clothes are thrown out each year here and only 35pc get recycled.Packaging waste remains a major issue too but Richard Bruton, chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, said it was one of the ‘low-hanging fruits’ that government and consumers could tackle.He urged adoption of the model in France where large supermarkets had to dedicate a quarter of their space to unpackaged food items that shoppers could take home in their own reusable containers.He said government should work with businesses to encourage change first but mandatory measures might be needed later on.“You need to promote innovation in the first place but over time you will see these practices that are proven doable embedded in regulation.“You don’t start with the big gun of regulation, which may be inflexible. You start to create the incentives and you set the targets.”The paper calls for development of a ‘national innovation hub’ to build in sustainability at the design stage of goods, and the creation of a system of ‘marks of best practice’ to recognise sustainability in manufacturing.It urges the development of ‘sustainability networks’ to support community repair and upcycling services and it says government must use its influence in public procurement contracts to ensure the most sustainable goods and services were paid for with public money.Mr Bruton said the policy document was not an attempt to muscle in on the Green Party but to help Minister Smyth decide his targets.“This is a concept whose time has come. Hats off to the Greens who perhaps identified that before others but it’s something we definitely need to do now, and we are fully shoulder to the wheel to make this effective,” he said.',\n",

       "  'title': 'From increased spending to tax breaks, can the ideas discussed at summit fix the housing crisis?',\n",
       "  'text': 'Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he wants 2023 to be a “year of inflection” in the housing crisis – having called a housing summit today as a “point of reflection”. But what are the ideas discussed today, can they work, and if so, how quickly? Viability This seems to have been the biggest focus of the day. Sources at the meeting said that there was a major push from some of the property and development companies there to overhaul some Government schemes aimed at making stranded apartment blocks viable. Largely because of changed financing conditions and higher interest rates, some builders cannot complete units with planning permission because the financial models underpinning them no longer stack up. They’re asking for subsidised funding to kick in at the start of the development process, rather than the end, with two of Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien’s flagship schemes, Croí Cónaithe Cities and Project Tosaigh, in their sites. Afterwards, Varadkar also spoke about purchasing large quantities of homes in advance, guaranteeing a certain price for a percentage of a development and hence “derisking” it. With a shortfall in housing commencements, the aim is to convert permissions into units in 2024, when the drop-off is predicted to bite. Spending more There is obviously a relationship between the money available for housing and the level of outputs – O’Brien consistently points to significantly bigger capital budgets for housing compared with previous years, and how the Coalition is recovering from a decade of underinvestment (although the Minister insisted today this isn’t a dig at his Coalition partners). Varadkar today insisted there was no barriers to spending growing “so long as the economy is strong and so long as the public finances can support it”. “Of course we’re willing and want to spend more money resolving the housing crisis.” However, it’s not that straightforward. As the Department of Finance has previously flagged, there are constraints in the economy around sourcing enough workers, materials and the capacity of the planning system which can’t be solved with fistfuls of cash. Sourcing more workers Since 2019, rules governing trades like bricklayer and plasterer have been relaxed – removed from the list of occupations ineligible for employment permits. Many construction sector workers from outside the European Economic Area are eligible for a general employment permit. However, the Economic and Social Research Institute has called for construction trades such as carpentry and plumbing to be added to the State’s critical skills list. There is also an upturn in the number of people taking up apprenticeships, but the legacy of the crash, which tarnished the sector for a generation of young people and saw many tradespeople emigrate, still has a big impact here. The Taoiseach said today that Ireland is facing this challenge at the same time many other countries are competing for skilled labour, meaning the country may struggle to attract people in, no matter what reforms are adopted. Emergency homeless measures The eviction ban hasn’t been successful in stemming the flow of people into homelessness – at least not yet – with record figures released before Christmas. It is due to expire at the end of March – leading to fears that whatever impact it is having on suppressing new homelessness will evaporate and make the situation worse. O’Brien has been slow to call for an extension, mindful that doing anything seen to force small landlords from the market will not help his cause. Varadkar confirmed it was discussed at today’s summit, but he conceded there wasn’t unanimity on the issue. Other steps discussed today included prioritising people in emergency accommodation for social housing, but the Taoiseach again said some had warned of the “negative consequences of unintended consequences” arising from such a step. Expanding measures for renters Budget 2023 saw the introduction of an annual €500 in tax relief for renters. The measure does little to solve the underlying problems in the rental market but it does address, to an extent, some of the affordability issues renters face, even if it is not the step change they need. Politically, it’s seen as a bulwark against losing more and more younger voters, so more measures like this, or an enhanced version, could prove politically popular. Tax breaks Probably the most politically contentious, if only because the Opposition will salivate at the prospect of attacking a Fianna Fáil Housing Minister for introducing tax breaks to encourage property development. Nonetheless, it was discussed today, the Taoiseach saying that “nothing is off the table”. O’Brien has been guarded in his public comments, but behind the scenes proposals have been under development for some time. The theory goes that Michael McGrath may be more open to the idea than his predecessor in the finance brief, Paschal Donohoe. Targeted tax breaks for apartment development in urban areas, capital allowance tax reliefs or a cut in VAT are all under consideration, as are tax breaks for smaller landlords to encourage them to stay in the market.',\n",

A total of 19,660 new jobs were created by Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2022. The jobs growth translates into a net increase of 10,841 jobs created last year. Employment increased across Enterprise Ireland’s three core economic sectors – technology & services (up 8% on 2021), industrial and life sciences (up 5%) and food and sustainability (up 3%). Strong employment growth was reported in specific sub sectors such as climate, sustainability and agritech (up 13%); digital technology (up 9%); high tech construction and housing (up 6%); fintech, financial & business services (up 6%); the life sciences and engineering sectors both saw 5% employment growth. “A real positive of today’s results is the regional balance in terms of both new jobs created and total employment,” said Minister for Enterprise, Trade & Employment, Simon Coveney. “More than 147,000 people in the regions are now employed by Enterprise Ireland client companies, making an enormous contribution to local economies and communities. “The government’s target to have a record 2.5 million people employed by 2024 has already been exceeded. Enterprise Ireland has also exceeded its own employment target for 2022 with these results announced today. “I firmly believe that with a strong focus on innovation, digitalisation, sustainability and regional development, Enterprise Ireland will continue to enhance their significant contribution to growing and maintaining quality jobs in every region and county in Ireland.” Enterprise Ireland CEO Leo Clancy said: “Enterprise Ireland supported companies like Version 1 play a vital role in the Irish economy, employing more than 218,000 people in cities, towns and villages throughout the country and making an enormous contribution to local economies. “Supporting Irish-owned companies to achieve greater scale and expand their global footprint is a priority for Enterprise Ireland in 2023 and we are committed to supporting Irish companies on their journey to become global leaders in their field.

       "  'title': 'Engineering consultancy EDC opens new Galway office',\n",
       "  'text': 'Engineering consultancy EDC, which celebrates 20 years in business this year, has announced the opening of a new Galway office. Gerard Kirwan, Associate Director at EDC, will head up this new office located. The addition of this office will bring EDC’s Irish presence to four Irish offices for the company, complementing their international offices in London and Istanbul. Over the past two years, EDC has experienced impressive growth, expanding its team to one hundred people across six offices in Cork, Dublin, Limerick, London, Istanbul, and most recently, Galway. This growth is reflected in EDC’s increased market share in the UK and Ireland, with staff numbers doubling from the start of 2021 to the end of 2022. EDC estimates that this trend will continue, with an additional 25% increase in staff numbers by the end of 2023 to support the investment and growth in market share. In August 2022, the firm announced the opening of a new office in Istanbul, Turkey, expanding the company’s presence in the MENAT region to accommodate client demand and leverage opportunities within these regions. The Istanbul team continues to grow, allowing them to provide best-in-class MEP Design and BIM services in the region; and to facilitate growth, they have moved to larger premises to facilitate doubling the size of the Istanbul team over the coming 12 – 18 months. Commenting on the opening of the Galway office and the company’s continued growth, Richard O’Farrell, Managing Director of EDC, said “As EDC celebrates 20 years in business in 2023, this expansion into Galway is another exciting step forward for the company, and sets the foundation for future growth across Ireland and beyond. The expansion is testament to the incredible work our whole team delivers, and this is driving us forward to realise new opportunities.” O’Farrell continued “The move into Galway aligns with the EDC’s growth strategy, which in recent years has also included the opening of a Limerick office to service the Mid-West of Ireland, the expansion of the leadership team with the appointment of Associate Directors across all offices; the opening and expansion of our Istanbul office; and significant growth in staffing.” Commenting on the Galway office opening, Gerard Kirwan, Associate Director at EDC, said “I am proud to head up EDC’s fourth Irish office, which marks an exciting chapter in the story of EDC and demonstrates the extent of the company’s growth in recent times. The decision to open an office in Galway strengthens our delivery capabilities and increases our ability to service our current and future clients and sectors.” As a proudly forward-thinking engineering firm, EDC offers services within a range of construction sectors from residential, commercial, industrial, and pharmaceutical, to retail, hospitality and leisure; with a focus on delivering the most innovative and sustainable designs to ensure all projects achieve their net zero carbon and ESG objectives.

       "  'title': 'Minister Harris gives go-ahead for next phase of proposed capital investment for TU Dublin - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris has today announced that Technological University Dublin (TUD) has been given the go-ahead to proceed to the next phase of the project proposal development for a ‘Design & Construct’ Sustainable Building Centre on their Broombridge Campus. The project envisages the refurbishment of a building in TU Dublin’s satellite facility in Broombridge in order to utilise it for core academic space to address capacity. It is anticipated that the proposed state-of-the-art campus would build capacity for the greater Dublin Area and beyond. Minister Harris confirmed that TU Dublin has been successful under the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund (TSSPF) and is now approved to proceed to develop the preliminary business case for a multi-disciplinary teaching and learning facility at Broombridge. It is envisaged that the new building will serve students in the areas of Architecture, Engineering and Construction. Speaking today, Minister Harris said: “Today is a key milestone as we see TU Dublin emerge from the first part of a robust strategic assessment process, and move to the next phase of the project life cycle development, which will see the development of preliminary business case. “This proposed new building would accommodate 1,400 new learners in key skills demand such as retrofit, low carbon technologies, Modern Methods of Construction (MMC), and in energy efficiency. “It is anticipated that its creation would be a Beacon for Sustainability and Climate Action, creating a Retrofit hub in one of the largest residential areas requiring retrofit in the city. “Investment will play an important role in supporting the technological sector as drivers of regional development by allowing them to better meet the needs of learners in their region, to deepen existing and forge new relationships with business and enterprise and to respond in an agile fashion to future developments. “The HEA in advancing these capital proposals, is playing a crucial leading role in rolling out the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund ensuring a pipeline of key strategic projects delivers for our learner, economic and societal needs, and we need to keep these objectives at the heart of all our decision making. The outcomes of the preliminary business case stage will inform the development of a pipeline of projects and future capital investment decisions. “The proposal developments to be advanced under the Technological Strategic Projects Fund, including 5 nationwide already announced, will complement significant investment right across the technological sector and further education and training sector.” Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery, and Reform Paschal Donohoe, who attended TU Dublin with Minister Harris today, said: “Since its inception, the Technological University (TU) agenda has sought to transform the Higher Education landscape and support the delivery of a highly skilled workforce, capable of meeting current as well as future economic and societal challenges at a national and regional level. “This investment in TU Dublin through the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund (TSSPF), in addition to the significant Exchequer resources provided to date, further highlights the Government’s support for the development and delivery of the Government’s TU agenda. “Ensuring these Universities are well equipped to deliver on our national ambitions is key. In total, including the NTF, approximately €4.1bn will be allocated to the Higher Education, Further Education and Training (FET) and Research and Innovation sectors in 2023. This reflects the importance of these sectors to the economy and the Government’s commitment to support learners through them.” President of TU Dublin Professor David FitzPatrick, welcomed the announcement: “TU Dublin is delighted to commence 2023 with this hugely significant announcement for the University, our students and the local community in Dublin 7, which will deliver a world-class multidisciplinary learning and industry engagement environment for students across the faculties of Engineering & Built Environment and Computing, Digital and Data, from apprenticeship to PhD. “Critically, the research, knowledge generation and skills development activities undertaken in Design + Construct will provide creative solutions that will be core to the sector’s efforts in addressing its key sustainability challenges that are contributing to the Climate Crisis, acting as a living construction laboratory encompassing best practices in sustainable design and construction.” Ciarán McCaffrey, Head of Capital Programmes in the HEA, said: “We welcome today’s announcement that TU Dublin are to proceed to the next phase of project proposal development under the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund (TSSPF). “The TSSPF is a key driver in delivering on the ambitions of the technological sector, aiding the sector in meeting the increased demand for education and driving more balanced regional development. The HEA look forward to working with all Higher Education Institutions, whose proposals are moving to the next phase of the TSSPF, in developing their preliminary business cases.” ENDS',\n",

       "  'title': 'Housing Minister rules out introducing regulations on people renting out spare rooms',\n",
       "  'text': 'HOUSING MINISTER DARRAGH O’Brien has ruled out introducing regulations on homeowners who rent a spare room to students, saying that implementing rules would reduce supply. In response to a Parliamentary Question by Fine Gael’s Neale Richmond, who asked if rights available to typical renters would be extended to people living in rented rooms, O’Brien said that the Government had no plans to introduce new regulations. Under current legislation, the Residential Tenancies Board does not have authority over licence agreements for people who are renting a room in a house where the landlord also lives. Rented rooms, or “digs”, are typically used by students while attending college and have been in short supply in recent years, with campaigns by students’ unions being run to boost the number of people offering rooms. Currently, people can rent out a room in their home and make up to €14,000 in rent tax free through the Rent a Room Relief tax credit. There has also been a lack of availability in overall student accommodation in recent years, with the Government now set to part-fund the construction of an additional 667 student beds across an initial three colleges. Despite challenges within the sector, O’Brien says that he does not believe adding regulations to the sector will improve the availability of digs. “I do not consider that there is a need for a legal regulatory framework in this area. Digs accommodation is an integral housing solution that suits both lodgers and home owners, providing an important source of revenue and, in some circumstances, social interaction,” O’Brien said. “Any attempt at regulating ‘digs’ is highly likely to impact negatively on the supply of this traditional and important source of accommodation.” He said that people who live in digs “benefit from the goodwill that exists to ensure that both lodgers and home owners are happy with the arrangement”. “It is possible for the arrangements to be formalised by way of a licence between the parties, but this is a matter of choice for the parties themselves to agree on,” he added. Despite not having plans to introduce regulations, O’Brien added that it would be kept under review.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Are we waiting for an Irish recession which may never arrive?',\n",
       "  'text': 'The economy continues to hold up, despite pressures from the cost-of-living crisis. New Central Statistics Office (CSO) figures give insights into the impact on households of soaring inflation and how they are responding. Huge uncertainty remains and there is no doubt that we are seeing a sharp slowdown in growth. But with the multinational sector still contributing to growth and signs from the euro zone not as bad as anticipated, might 2023 again see the Irish economy hanging in? 1. Standard of living edging down The cost-of-living crisis is, of course, having a big impact. A key insight from the latest CSO figures is the hit on the disposable income of households – a measure of the standard of living. The real (inflation-adjusted) level of disposable income fell in the third quarter by around 0.4 per cent compared to the previous three months – and has declined in three of the last four quarters. It peaked in the third quarter of 2021, when it reached the highest level in the 24-year history of collecting the data. The longer term trend here was a big fall in living standards after the 2008 financial crash followed by a few years of not much change and then a strong recovery. The drop after the crash was around 11 per cent, based on the latest CSO figures looking at household disposable income. There followed a period when living standards bumped along before a rise started in 2015. They did not get back to their pre-financial crash peak until early 2107. By the third quarter of last year, living standards as measured by disposable income had risen by more than 30 per cent from their lowest levels after the financial crash. They have now fallen by 1.4 per cent from this peak. The big question is what happens next. Notably, the latest fall in living standards is due to higher inflation. People’s incomes have, on average, continued to rise – unlike in the wake of the financial crash, job numbers remain strong, unemployment is at a record low and wages, on average, are rising. Household earnings were up in the third quarter of 2022 as more people were in work – but soaring inflation outpaced this growth, leaving real incomes lower. That, if you like, is the bad news. 2. But savings are up and spending is solid The better news is that despite this, consumer spending has been quite resilient and also households – probably largely better-off ones – are continuing to accumulate significant savings. Savings were running at 19.5 per cent of income in the third quarter of last year, as shown by the latest CSO figures. According to a note from Davy economist Conall MacCoille: “This is an enormous buffer for many households to potentially sustain spending through the squeeze in real incomes from energy bills and elevated CPI inflation.” Savings rates here remain among the highest internationally and have transformed from the years before the financial crash – Irish consumers, chastened by the experience of the crash, are much more cautious now, a trend also evident in total borrowing figures, with net savings also boosted by debt being paid down, as well as more cash in the bank. Savings rates now are close to double the 10 per cent average in the years before the pandemic, even if they have fallen back from their pandemic lockdown highs when many normal spending routes – holidays, nights-out and so on – were closed off. Consumer spending also remains surprisingly resilient, despite the squeeze on incomes. Here we need to be careful to understand the impact of inflation. Households are spending more cash because prices are going up, but their money isn’t going as far as it did before. Nonetheless, the latest figures show a slight increase in the volume of consumer goods and services purchased during the third quarter. As this coincides with lower disposable income, it suggest households are dipping into savings a bit to keep up consumption. More recent CSO figures suggest that the squeeze on spending continues to tighten. Retail sales figures for the month, which look at spending on goods, show the total cash spend by consumers was up 3.6 per cent year on year in November, but the actual volume of goods this bought was down 4.2 per cent. The gap is explained by inflation and particularly the need by households to spend around 20 per cent more on energy bills. Excluding volatile car sales, the volume of sales was nonetheless up 3.5 per cent in November on the previous month. So far, household spending, a vital piece of the overall economic picture, while under pressure, is hanging in. Christmas trends will be interesting to watch. 3. What about the rest of the economy? The business sector is the other key part of the economy to watch. While forward-looking purchasing managers’ indices show nervousness and indicate a slowdown, employment remains strong. The latest official figures show a drop to 4.3 per cent in the unemployment rate and jobs website Indeed says the level of postings on its site remain 60 per cent up on pre-pandemic levels. Grant Thornton’s latest survey of Irish business also shows that attracting and retaining labour remains a key issue for Irish companies. So while we know of lay-offs and slowing recruitment in the tech sector – and the latest BNP Paribas index suggests that construction firms have also slowed hiring – there is still strong demand for people in many sectors and this is supporting wages as well as job numbers. Employment tends to be a lagging indicator when a slowdown hits, so these figures bear close watching going into 2023. But so far, given the hit to the economy and to businesses from higher prices, jobs have held up better than would have been expected. Recent figures also show that the export sector remains strong and we know that, driven by multinationals, this continues to lead to strong growth in GDP and even in figures such as Gross National Income which factor out some of the distortions from the multinational sector. The latest data shows that gross value added by industry in the State was 21 per cent – (or €17.8 billion) higher in the third quarter than in the same period in 2021- much of it driven by manufacturing, within which pharma and medtech remains dominant. The ICT sector grew, but at a slower pace – and will likely slow or decline this year. While much of the extra value added flowed back in profit repatriations and royalty payments, multinationals continue to support Ireland’s overall economic figures. Domestic businesses continued their bounceback from Covid-19 lockdowns. However some closures in areas such as the restaurant sector show that the combined impact of Covid and the cost-of-living crisis is taking its toll. 4. The bottom line The resilience of the economy here – and signs that the euro zone may not hit the deep recession which had been anticipated – give some cause for optimism that Irish growth can stay in positive territory this year. This will be supported by multinationals, while the cost-of-living squeeze will continue to put pressure on households and their spending. The consumer sector may thus face its own mini-recession and this will continue to put some domestic firms in trouble, with predictions of a jump in liquidations. But with strong savings in better-off households, overall spending levels will not see the kind of fall seen after the financial crash. The uncertain course of the war in Ukraine – and the implications of this for the world economy – mean the economic outlook for the Republic remains impossible to predict with any confidence. Sentiment has been shaken by the cost-of-living crisis and growth has slowed rapidly after the bounceback from Covid shutdowns in the domestic economy. But what we can say is that, so far, the impact of the cost-of-living crisis has been a good deal less dramatic than would have been expected.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Developer Johnny Ronan in €140m deal for Citi’s Dublin HQ',\n",
       "  'text': 'Johnny Ronan’s Ronan Group Real Estate (RGRE) has acquired Citigroup’s existing European headquarters on Dublin’s North Wall Quay. While the value of the deal has not been disclosed, RGRE is understood to have paid about €140 million to secure ownership of the property in the face of competition from UK-headquartered private equity property manager Henderson Park, and from developer Shane Whelan’s Westridge Real Estate. The offices at 1 North Wall Quay were offered to the market by agent Knight Frank at a guide price of €120 million last March. News of RGRE’s purchase of the property comes just six days after The Irish Times reported its completion of a €300 million deal with Citi to develop a new European headquarters for the US-headquartered banking giant at its Waterfront South Central site in Dublin’s north docklands. Citi is understood to be paying about €100 million to acquire the site, with a further €200 million being set aside for the construction of its new base. Due for completion in 2026, the bank’s proposed footprint will equate to roughly 60 per cent of the 430,000sq ft of office accommodation RGRE intends to develop as part of the wider north docklands scheme. Once Citi’s workforce is ready to move into Waterfront South Central and vacate the company’s current premises at 1 North Wall Quay, RGRE will take ownership of the building, with plans being put in place to transform the property into a 500,000sq ft landmark office capable of accommodating a major corporate occupier. RGRE completed its purchase of Citi’s existing headquarters with funding provided by Landfair, a company headed up by Colony Capital’s former managing director of investment management, Stefan Jaeger. During his tenure at Colony, Mr Jaeger worked in partnership with RGRE on its delivery of Irish and European headquarters for Amazon, Salesforce and Facebook owner, Meta. Commenting on his company’s completion of its two-part deal with Citi, RGRE chief executive Rory Williams said: “The choice of Waterfront South Central (WSC) as the future home of Citi in the European Union represents a major vote of confidence in the continued strength of the Irish economy. This demonstrates the increasing desirability of Dublin as a European base for leading global companies, especially in the financial and banking sectors. “Ronan Group’s expertise in delivering world-class buildings has also received a vote of confidence, as demonstrated by the institutional backing of our transaction to redevelop Citi’s current HQ at North Wall Quay.” Davinia Conlan, interim Citi country head for Ireland, said: “We are thrilled to have finalised the location for our new building in Ireland. Our aim is to develop a state-of-the-art, sustainable workplace with the highest standards of design and technology. This significant investment is a signal of our commitment to Ireland, to Europe and to our people.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Wave of small landlords selling investment properties, claims report',\n",
       "  'text': 'Approximately 40 per cent of property sales in the final three months of last year involved landlords selling their investment properties, according to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). The finding, contained in the SCSI’s latest annual report, appears to buttress the industry narrative that smaller landlords are being squeezed out of the market by stricter rent controls and higher tax burdens. The report found that increasing levels of buy-to-let properties were being put on the market, aggravating supply shortages in the rental sector. Landlord exodus It noted that on average 40 per cent of residential sale instructions to agents in the fourth quarter of 2022 were landlords selling their investment property. The SCSI linked the exodus of smaller landlords to “overly complex” rent legislation; low rental returns; and compliance with “onerous” housing standards. “The trend of private landlords exiting the market has serious implications for the supply of rental properties,” warned John O’Sullivan, chairman of the SCSI’s practice and policy committee. “SCSI agents are reporting that the supply of available units to rent is at one of the lowest levels ever experienced and they don’t believe the situation is set to improve in the short term,” he said, noting that almost eight out of 10 agents surveyed by the SCSI are of the view that individual buy-to-let second-hand rental units being sold at present will not be replaced in the rental market in the next two years. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has promised to introduce incentives to retain smaller landlords amid a pronounced decline in available rental properties. Property website Daft noted recently that there were just 1,087 homes available to rent nationally on its website as of November 1st, including just 345 in Dublin. In its report, the SCSI predicted house prices would continue to rise this year by an average of 2 per cent — 1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023 and a further 1 per cent over the course of the next three quarters — despite the dampening effects of inflation and higher interest rates, which have triggered reversals in other countries most notably the UK. While economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rate hikes have cooled the market, affordability and viability remain key issues, it said. It calculated that new homes remain unaffordable for first-time buyers in several counties. On the basis of a first-time buyer (FTB) couple having a combined annual income of €89,000 and being able to borrow €356,000, equivalent to four times gross salary as per the Central Bank rules, the SCSI estimates counties Kildare and Wicklow would be unaffordable based on average house prices by €27,000 and €74,000 respectively. Meath, Cork and Galway remain affordable to the average FTB couple with available purchasing power exceeding new homes prices by as much as €28,000, €8,000 and €21,000 respectively, it said. Direct impact On the wider issue of supply, the group said while new housing completions in 2022 are expected to be at their highest levels in approximately a decade, about 25,000, there is concern among SCSI agents that commencements and planning permission numbers are declining and that this will have a direct impact on the number of completions this year and possibly into 2024. It said its members had highlighted the cost of construction as a particular concern in relation to the supply of new homes with inflation and labour shortages contributing to higher costs. The SCSI estimated that based on current new housing completion projections there will need to be an increase of almost 8 per cent of new home output each year to 2030 to meet the Government’s Housing for All targets. This means the State would need to be building 27,000 new homes this year, rising to 39,000 in five years and over 45,000 by 2030.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Troy was the capital of a rich and powerful kingdom which fell to the Greeks by deception – the Trojan horse ruse, according to the Iliad. This episode in one of the oldest works of literature still widely read by modern audiences continues to cast a spell, including on hard-line loyalists convinced the Northern Ireland Protocol is another Trojan horse engineered to con them out of the UK. The trope of a plucky people weathering siege, a people who cannot be beaten by fair means but may be betrayed by foul, has enduring appeal to loyalism. Somehow, this endlessly convenient theme has managed to embed itself in the protocol narrative.Jeffrey “Hector” Donaldson has positioned himself as a strong leader protecting his citadel against predators, as Dublin and Brussels are characterised. Eventually, Troy’s Hector was outfought by the Greek warrior Achilles. But it needn’t always be a case of death or glory, a defeated opponent lashed to the victor’s chariot and his remains dragged around the city walls. Compromise is possible if the will is there. A big if, in this case.But nothing else will revive the North’s democratic institutions after a layoff of almost a year. When then-First Minister Paul Givan of the DUP resigned last February it effectively meant Stormont’s collapse. Bulldozing is easier than building, unfortunately. A reluctance to compromise has taken root, and it has been allowed to drift for too long.But there is always cause to hope. Positions can shift, especially if local politicians feel listened to when big-wigs arrive on their turf. Currently, a flurry of activity is happening north of the Border, with senior politicians from Westminster and Leinster House congregating for meetings and side-meetings, handshakes and the odd cold shoulder – stupidity on stilts from James Cleverly’s staff. Britain’s foreign secretary should have notched up an easy score in Belfast by sitting down with all five parties. But the exclusion of Mary Lou McDonald, which led to the SDLP staying away out of solidarity, turned it into a Whitehall bungle.Still, if we’re comparing putdowns, the latest decision by His Majesty’s government on border controls is a bigger snub than leaving the Sinn Féin leader out of a meeting. There’ll be other days and other meetings. But checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain, to ensure they comply with EU regulations, are another matter entirely for loyalism. They show which way the wind is blowing.Yesterday, Britain published legislation on border controls at ports which takes matters out of the Assembly’s hands. There will be a green lane – minimal paperwork and no routine checks – for goods from Britain staying in Northern Ireland, and a red lane for goods moving onwards to the Republic and into the EU. Here we have a sensitive spot for the DUP: in a show of strength, its agriculture minister Edwin Poots had construction of checking areas stopped – but the UK is now signalling intent to complete the facilities as part of its negotiations with the EU. This suggests an administration looking for a solution to the EU’s concerns rather than the DUP’s.A deal acceptable to the UK and the EU is the goal. A deal that also passes the DUP’s stress test naturally is desirable in the interests of harmony, but may not be possible – and at some point Rishi Sunak, who has said he’s working flat out to break the deadlock, will shrug, or pull a sad face. But the DUP’s objections won’t be allowed to block progress. On past form, the DUP will turn to the Conservatives’ ERG wing. Support from that quarter may be forthcoming – or the Tory hard right may be preoccupied with more pressing matters as strikes cripple Britain across multiple sectors.Mr Donaldson is no fool, and needs something he can sell to his base. Yesterday he said some progress was made on “technical issues” but there were “major political issues” not yet addressed. Political issues, of course, are the reason the DUP is anti-protocol – fear of being edged out of the UK’s Elysian Fields. Nothing to do with a trade pact which gives Northern Ireland a less awful Brexit than other parts of the union. Let’s not forget the protocol itself is a compromise and a majority of MLAs favour it. As does a majority of the broader population.The DUP is illogical in complaining trade checks distinguish it from the rest of the union when the party has had no problem with other differences, from an armed police force to abortion law to Sunday trading restrictions. Nor is there any consistency in the DUP boycotting the Assembly, while continuing to sit at Westminster – where the protocol was passed into law. Little wonder people wonder if what’s at issue here is a party unable to manage peaceful transition of power.Politics in Northern Ireland continues to quiver on the verge of collapse, with the region being run yet again by its civil servants, hardly an example of democracy in action because they have no mandate from the people. The cost-of-living and healthcare crises demand local politicians making decisions locally.Talk-talk is preferable to the alternative, but none of what’s happening currently is particularly democratic. The Assembly lying idle represents a fundamental lack of respect for democracy by the DUP, although the party argues its proposed boycott was in its manifesto. What a topsy-turvy world, when an electoral result is interpreted as a vote not to enter government. A generation on from the Good Friday Agreement – a shining example of compromise, but one which the DUP didn’t sign up to – people deserve better of those elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly (or Norlin Airlin Assemblie in Ulster-Scots, in case you’re interested).It’s in the North’s best interests to give the DUP some life jackets to reactivate the Assembly. Must needs. But let’s bear in mind that life’s heroes aren’t the grandstanders rattling their shields and making ostentatious or bellicose speeches. True heroics lie in grafting to deliver improvements for the community. That’s what the art of politics is really about.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin TD, today announced an open call for applications for a new funding scheme aimed at enhancing civic society engagement across the island of Ireland. The Shared Island Civic Society Fund will promote practical North South cooperation and engagement, across a range of sectors and themes, consistent with the objectives and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement. It will encourage and support civic society and community organisations to further strengthen existing partnerships and/or to develop new cross-border links, to build connectivity on issues of concern for the island of Ireland. The scheme, which has been developed as part of the Government’s Shared Island initiative and supported through the Shared Island Fund, will provide €500,000 to cross-border projects in the first year of operation. It is expected that increased funding will be made available in future years. The Fund will support regional, national and sectoral cross-border civic engagement in areas including Climate and Environment; Community development; Heritage and conservation; Social Enterprise; Charity and Voluntary Sector, and Sport. Announcing the launch of the Fund in Armagh, the Tánaiste said: “I am pleased to launch this initiative, which will complement the vital work that is already supported through my Department’s Reconciliation Fund and other funding schemes, to promote North South cooperation and enhance cross-border civic, economic, cultural, and political links across the island. “Civic society often provides a unique dynamic for building understanding and consensus in areas where politics alone cannot. There is already deep and constructive cooperation within civic society and it is encouraging to see so many organisations already collaborating on an all-island basis, combining ideas and capacity to deliver benefits far beyond what can be achieved separately. “However, for civic society to flourish, it requires support. This Fund will reinforce the important civic engagement already taking place and support new and innovative cross-border civic initiatives, with North/South or East/West dimensions. “We are enabling civic society to develop new links, forums, and projects that will help to build a truly shared island. “I strongly encourage civic organisations North and South to apply.” Applications for funding under the Shared Island Civic Society Fund will be accepted from Monday, 16 January 2023 until Monday, 27 February 2023. Further information, including eligibility and application process details, is available at https://www.dfa.ie/about-us/funding/sharedislandcivicsocietyfund/. ENDS',\n",

       "  'title': 'Machinery Focus: Vertical take-off for Tyrone Trailers',\n",
       "  'text': 'Meath Farm Machinery has long set out its stall as being associated with quality equipment, and it has recently added Tyrone Trailers to its list of franchises, a make that it believes fits right in with this philosophy. Tyrone Trailers is a relative newcomer to the machinery business although its founder and managing director, Declan McMoran, has been crafting trailers and other machinery for over 25 years. Manufacturing hotspot Co. Tyrone itself has become an engineering hub over the last few decades with a large number of companies supplying the quarrying and construction industries located there. Little surprise then that from this pool of engineering talent and expertise there has arisen a new company with the same ethos of building strength and quality as that of the multinationals supplying the construction industry. Like many engineering companies, pinning down an exact birth date is a difficult quest, however, Declan had started making trailers on a part-time basis for a friend in 2018, going full-time in 2019, and he has not looked back since. Application of expertise The impetus to go full-time came when Declan suddenly realised that he had nine trailers on order – as well as a day job. It was sink or swim time, so he took the plunge and last year the 20 staff that now work for the company produced 280 trailers for sale in Ireland, the UK and Europe, with the Nordic countries in particular being a strong market for the company. This is, by any measure, a spectacular growth rate and it has been helped by the arrival of Kevin McSorley as sales manager, whose experience in selling heavy equipment abroad has been invaluable. Herein lies the key to the design of the product, it is heavy engineering scaled down rather than light engineering scaled up; there is a solidity about the trailers wherever you look. Shopping list Meath Farm Machinery first became aware of Tyrone Trailers when the company went out looking for a new loader to use themselves for recovery work. They had a list of requirements in mind, the chief one being that it had to be well built and well finished, it would be seen behind a John Deere whenever it was out on the road after all. The trailer they eventually purchased from the company has a length of 30ft and a gross weight of 30t, giving a carrying capacity of 22.5t. It has two fixed and one steering axle, all on steel springs. As yet, no customer has requested air suspension, although Declan is by no means averse to fitting it if required. The rear ramps are are hydraulically adjustable for width and spread to 2.9m to accommodate combine harvesters and other wide-tracked machinery, a facility bolstered by outriggers giving another 15cm to either side of the deck. 20t pull At the front sits a 10t hydraulic winch which is mounted strongly enough to enable the use of a snatch block, thus doubling its capacity to 20t. Big hydraulic winches are not cheap, but the beauty of running them from a tractor’s hydraulics is that they are a lot quicker than relying on a 12v trailer plug to supply the power. The deck is of 50mm timber, except for the steel plates sitting above the wheels. These were specified by Meath Farm Machinery to avoid a build-up of mud and dirt on the wood, which would shorten its life. This ability to fully customise the specifications of the trailer is another strong attraction for customers, according to Kevin. Tyrone Trailers build to spec Buying a trailer is not simply a matter of choosing the colour, there is always a discussion with the customer as to what he intends the trailer to be used for, as this will help ensure his needs are met. In the case of Meath Farm Machinery, the recovery of large machines, such as harvesters, would be the most demanding task asked of it, and so the trailer was designed and built with this in mind. The ramps, winch, axle arrangement, outriggers etc., were all requested by Meath Farm Machinery when ordering the trailer, and despite the manufacturer’s heavy workload, they were all incorporated into the final item. One point to note from the rapid growth of Tyrone Trailers is that it was not overly held-up by material shortages, which is something often complained of elsewhere in the industry. Steel supply did not hold up production to any great extent, and it appears that component availability has returned to something like normal, with shipment delays easing as more containers become available globally. Two-month delivery The company quotes a lead time of around eight weeks and is happily continuing to take orders for its whole range, which includes dump trailers as well as low loaders. Prices are also said to have stabilised. As to the future then, while it is the agricultural/construction contractor market which provides the mainstay of its business, it is intending to enter the commercial vehicle sector with bespoke low loaders later this year. Tyrone Trailers may be a young company, but it is coming from an area steeped in engineering and managed by people who know the business and how to work with steel. As yet, despite its immediate success, it has to make its presence felt fully on the Irish market, but with the quality of build shown in this particular example, that may not be too long in coming.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Oxfam calls for wealth tax as the number of Ireland&#039;s super-rich doubles in a decade',\n",
       "  'text': 'Despite a drop from nine to eight in the number of Irish billionaires following the death last year of Indian-Irish construction magnate Pallonji Mistry, Oxfam said the number of Irish people who earn more than $5m (€4.6m) has also doubled in the past ten years. According to Forbes, which Oxfam uses to track global individual wealth, Limerick brothers John and Patrick Collison top Ireland’s rich list with individual wealth of $8.1bn (€7.5bn) each. Oxfam said their combined wealth of €15bn is more than the €10.3bn in wealth held by the entire bottom 50% of the population. The Oxfam report said that, globally, the richest 1% have acquired nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of humanity over the past two years. “This rising wealth at the top and rising poverty for the rest are two sides of the same coin, proof that our economic system is functioning exactly how the rich and powerful designed it to,” Oxfam Ireland’s CEO, Jim Clarken said. “A wealth tax on elite Irish wealth at graduated rates of 2%, 3% and 5% above a high threshold of €4.7m would raise €8.2bn annually, with the potential to transform Irish public services in health, housing and education while also delivering on our international and climate commitments,” he said. Third on Ireland’s rich list is US financier John Grayken who founded private equity firm Lone Star Funds and who took Irish citizenship in 1999. Telecoms magnate Denis O’Brien is fourth, followed by British hedge-fund manager John Armitage who took Irish citizenship in 1999. Campbell’s Soup heir John Dorrance III is sixth followed by financier Dermot Desmond who Forbes says has an individual wealth of €1.9bn. Eugene Murtagh who founded building materials giant Kingspan is eighth on the list. According to Forbes, John Collison aged 32 remains one of the world’s youngest billionaires positioned 13th on the list. His 34-year-old brother Patrick is 20th on the list of youngest billionaires. Oxfam said money derived from new wealth taxes was urgently needed by ordinary people. \"Entire countries are facing bankruptcy, with the poorest countries now spending four times more repaying debts to rich creditors than on healthcare,\" Mr Clarken said. \"Three quarters of the world’s governments are planning austerity-driven public sector spending cuts — including on healthcare and education — of $7.8 trillion over the next five years,” They said inequality has led to the World Bank announcing that the world has almost certainly lost its goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030. The Oxfam report was published as economic leaders meet in Davos. The WEF’s annual Global Risks Report showed the threat of recession, the cost-of-living crisis and mounting debt distress will dominate the outlook for the next two years. The World Bank this week slashed its growth forecasts for most countries and regions, and warned that new adverse occurrences could tip the global economy into a recession. The CEOs of Moderna and Pfizer will also be speaking at the summit, with one panel devoted to how fast vaccines can be created the next time a pandemic hits. The future of work will also feature. Whether to return to the office, as well as the rise of “quiet quitting” and the four-day week.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Michael Stone profile: the quiet engineering pioneer caught up in Paschal Donohoe posters furore',\n",
       "  'text': 'MICHAEL Stone is described by associates as an intensely private and quietly impressive man who would recoil at the exposure he is now getting for paying to put up Paschal Donohoe’s election posters in 2016. The 54-year-old engineering and construction entrepreneur, who began his career as an apprentice with the ESB before founding the very successful Designer Group (DG) in 1992, is known within his industry as reserved yet driven.Advisers who have worked on deals with him say he is low-key but confident, and expert in his field but humble enough to take advice on subjects outside his domain.Known for his early arrivals in his firm’s office in Blanchardstown, Dublin, his ambition and professionalism grew DG from a start-up to one of Ireland’s leading electrical and mechanical engineering firms.Over 30 years, Mr Stone has retained 100pc ownership of the company, developing it into an international specialist with a blue-chip client list boasting Google, Amazon, Diageo and a host of high-profile public-sector projects in Dublin.Before Covid knocked the construction sector back for a couple of years, DG achieved turnover of €250m from operations in Ireland, the UK, Europe and Africa.For the year ending March 2022, DG had turnover of €175m and profits of €18m, including the proceeds from selling 50pc of a joint venture in a facilities management firm to its partner, Sisk.In the last two years, the company took nearly €5m in Covid wage subsidies too.Mr Stone has not taken any dividends from the firm in recent years, despite €36m in cash in hand. But directors’ remuneration is generous at €2.9m.The company does not disclose the compensation of key personnel, but Mr Stone is doing well enough financially to have bought a sprawling mid-century mansion in Killiney, south Dublin, last April for €4.6m – below the list price of €5m.A promotional video for the home by estate agents Sherry FitzGerald shows extensive and exuberant gardens with dramatic views across Killiney Bay.Characteristically, the house is hidden on a quiet lane behind tall hedges and a heavy security gate.But even though Mr Stone doesn’t court public attention for his achievements, he has nonetheless become a person of influence.He was a ministerial appointee to the Land Development Agency (LDA) in December 2021 and acted as chair for the agency’s first three meetings in January, February and March last year, reverting to a non-executive director role once former Goodbody corporate finance director Cormac O’Rourke assumed the chair in April.Mr Stone has waived his remuneration fee since the outset of his involvement with the LDA and does not claim expenses.The avid Dublin GAA supporter has also chaired the North East Inner City Initiative – in Mr Donohoe’s constituency – since 2017, where he has compiled a lengthy list of accomplishments, including community festivals; training and education initiatives; action against crime and drugs; and several sport and recreation programmes.As Construction Industry Federation (CIF) president in 2015 and 2016, Mr Stone was determined to rehabilitate the reputation of the industry after the catastrophe of the financial crisis.“We have been lying down and taking a beating for too long,” he told magazine in 2015.“Our members have not made huge amounts of money at the expense of the Government or the people of Ireland. We have built and delivered projects that have allowed people to go to work, school, college and receive treatment in our hospitals. We should be proud of what we are achieving.”In a callback to his own professional origins, he promoted the value of apprenticeships during his CIF tenure, pushing member firms to invest in their own training and development programmes as a pathway into the industry. He has made that same emphasis at DG, where 170 of its 750 Irish staff came up as apprentices.Those who have worked alongside Mr Stone praised him for his progressive approach as CEO of DG, investing in technological innovation to create a more hospitable workplace for women. “Employers need to provide better facilities for women,” he told in a 2018 interview.“I think a lot of building sites traditionally are not set up in a way to allow women to work comfortably. My own opinion is that the secret to getting more women involved in the industry is the further development of off-site fabrication.”DG’s innovative approach has made the company a favourite of tech firms, pharma companies and brewers such as Guinness.In addition to projects at famous private addresses such as St James’s Gate, in recent years DG has been central to several major public-sector projects. The company’s vans are seen everywhere on the capital’s streets.A partial list of highly visible projects includes the construction of Technology University Dublin’s Grangegorman campus with Sisk, high-spec installs at Trinity College’s business school and bioscience facility, a fit-out at Dublin Castle and the refurbishment of Government Buildings and Leinster House in 2018.Attempts were made to contact Mr Stone via his company but messages were not returned.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Republic using productivity boom to invest public infrastructure and housing – Slugger O'Toole\",\n",
       "  'text': 'A typically spunky piece from the New Statesman’s new columnist Wolfgang Münchau starts with a great quote from Otto von Bismarck: “Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others.” He has Angela Merkel in his sights. He notes that despite the appearance of economic success, her austerity policies have led to a public investment shortfall in public investment of some half-a-trillion pounds, with the dire consequences only leeching up from the ground slowly in a series of spectacular shortfalls. He cites a motorway linking the north and south of Germany which has been closed because there’s no money to repair a bridge that’s become unsafe, and one Bundeswehr general has warned the army is so underfunded it cannot fight a war for more than a few weeks. He accuses Merkel of not being interested in solving problems, something he argues you can get away with until they accumulate and blow up in your face. Germany has relied on cheap Russian gas to sustain old industries so many sectors have missed the digital revolution. Productivity has fallen through the floor. Münchau recommends higher public investment as a way to levering it back up again on the basis that even a modest increase in productivity ‘would have a disproportionately large effect on the government’s ability to borrow’. So, finally, to Ireland. There have been worries about the fact the current coalition government has been throwing caution to the wind and doing the opposite: borrowing like crazy to fund infrastructure investment and critically from a political point of view, housing. According to Cliff Taylor there is a gap growing in the government’s plans in the south to calm a housing crisis which burgeoned out of af largely inactive period from the time of post crash ghost estates, until the present government set out its plans in the summer of 2020: The end of the era of super-low interest rates is the fundamental reason. For years, house building and the wider construction sector was funded almost exclusively by the Irish banking sector, via loans to builders and developers and also mortgage borrowers. Irish banks were in on both sides of an over-inflating market. Then, after the crash, Irish banks stepped out in terms of lending to developers and international funds stepped in. But now, as interest rates rise, the game has changed for these investors. When you can get a safe return of 3.5 per cent for putting your cash into US government bonds, the profit needed to justify investment in Irish property goes up. Meanwhile the cost of building has shot upwards. The economics of building apartments – already challenging – is now undermined and even house building becomes more financially difficult. So the international investors are stepping out. And with domestic builders also hit by higher costs and the Irish banks still loath to extend their lending to the property sector, there is a funding gap. The Irish government is now planning to offer support… …effectively giving a Government guarantee to buy some or all of certain projects when completed. In turn, this would help builders and developers to get finance from banks or investors to get schemes under way and finish them. It is also eyeing up some 70,000 planning permissions that have already granted and hoping that if can these could be got moving, it would make a huge difference to the figures. But, and this where the contraction of the two former dominant parties at local level hurts… Development efforts by local authorities and State agencies seem painfully slow and there is often little sense that everyone is pulling in the one direction. Local politicians try to secure their positions by objecting to many projects. Whoever is in government will face the same problem of “getting things done” when faced with a dysfunctional system, and a Nimby culture. Against this background, the challenge now for the Government is to ensure that the bucks being thrown into housing – probably €5 billion or more this year when the cost of tax incentives is added to direct spending – generate the required bang. Luckily (because of the presence of multinationals) productivity in the south is not the burden it is in the UK or Germany. The sun is shining in the south (€12bn or £10.5bn in corporation tax receipts in 2020) and the government is mending (and building) roofs. As Münchau notes of Liz Truss’s failed productivity experiment: It is not the debt that is the problem, but what you do with it.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Ministers Harris and Ryan welcome record number of enrolments in retrofitting programmes for 2022 - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris TD together with Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan TD have today welcomed the significant progress being made in the number of participants in Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB) and Retrofit upskilling and reskilling programmes in 2022. Following progress in developing a national network of Centres of Excellence in retrofit skills training, including NZEB skills, the number of workers availing of these opportunities has increased steadily since the first centre was opened in 2020. Numbers have risen from 363 to 793 enrolments in 2021 and to a record 2,034 enrolments in 2022. This reflects an increase of 118% between 2020 and 2021, and 156% between 2021 and 2022. Minister Harris said “I am delighted to see the increased uptake of these important courses. We are on track to having the highly knowledgeable and skilled workers needed to meet workforce needs between now and 2030. “With the opening of the ETB Centres of Excellence, the capacity for workers looking to upskill in the area of Green Skills is there. As demand for retrofit increases there will be significant employment opportunities and I would encourage anyone in the construction trade to get onboard and help us build warmer, more energy efficient homes. “Last year also saw the establishment of a dedicated Construction and Green Skills Programme Office within SOLAS. Working with ETBs nationally, this office is focused on developing programmes and initiatives to drive forward this reform agenda with a particular focus on the construction sector. “The government has set an ambitious target to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030 and the increased numbers enrolling on NZEB courses and establishment of the SOLAS Programme office are important steps towards delivering on this target.” Minister Ryan said: “Last year we met our target to retrofit 27,000 homes. This year we aim to retrofit 37,000 and I have no doubt we will make that target also, and then, those beyond that. The pipeline of interest is huge. People up and down the country are clamouring to make their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run. “The one way we can keep up with this demand is to ensure that we have enough highly skilled people to respond to it. The increased numbers we are seeing committing to these NZEB courses is so encouraging. And while it means that more and more homes can become better houses to live in, it also means that thousands of workers with valuable green skills can be sure that they have work for years, if not decades into the future. Green jobs are also sustainable jobs for the longterm.” The skills training is provided in a number of further and higher education facilities including at Centres of Excellence operated by Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB), Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board (LOETB), and Limerick Clare Education and Training Board (LCETB). Courses are also delivered in Cork ETB and Mayo-Sligo-Leitrim ETB with further provision due later this year and in 2024. The courses are free, fast and flexible with weekend and evening provision available. In many cases, where a person has an existing construction-related qualification, knowledge or experience, they can learn these skills quickly, usually within three-four days. Those in the sector interested in upskilling can find out more details by visiting gov.ie/therightcourse. The National Construction Training Campus in Mount Lucas also provide a 1 day tailored introductory programme for Transition Year and Leaving Cert students to give them a better understanding of NZEB principles while using a mixture of practical skills and theory. Retrofitting is both an important economic activity, and critical in meeting Ireland’s climate targets, and the delivery of the Government’s Housing for All plan. Nearly Zero Energy Buildings have a very high energy performance, with renewable sources as their dominant energy source. Making homes more energy efficient through retrofitting not only makes homes warmer and more comfortable, but can help households save money on bills and help to reach climate goals. ENDS Notes to the Editor The recently published Climate Action Plan 2023 (CAP23) sets out the actions required to halve our emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. The SOLAS Green Skills for FET Roadmap 2021-2030 was launched in March 2022 incorporating the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and the Green Skills Action Programme which began in 2021. The National Recovery and Resilience Plan committed €29m to NZEB and Retrofit upskilling and reskilling programmes and €10m to green skills modules, and includes the provision of 4,550 retrofit and NZEB standard places and 60,000 green skills places by the end of 2022. Alongside courses in NZEB and retrofit, a national suite of Green Skills programmes is currently being developed by SOLAS in collaboration with enterprise partners for blended delivery by ETBs in areas such as sustainability awareness and resource efficiency to assist in delivering on these challenges. A SOLAS eCollege course on a general Introduction to Green Skills was developed in partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. This was launched on 28 November 2022 and gives a taster insight into sustainability at home and in work.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Scotland’s construction sector faces a “major task ahead” to recruit workers – with industry bosses estimating almost 20,000 more staff will be needed over the next five years. A new report from the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) showed some 19,550 extra workers – 3,910 a year – will be required to meet demand in the sector between now and 2027 in Scotland.There is demand for workers for infrastructure projects, private housebuilding and repair and maintenance work, according to the annual construction skills network report.As part of its efforts to boost recruitment, the CITB has recently launched its employer network pilot project – which helps local firms recognise their training priorities.In Scotland, the pilot is being led by the Scottish Civils Training Group, with an initial focus on supporting employers from Inverness.In addition to this, the CITB’s Scottish Academy for Construction Opportunities awarded £1.3 million of funding to help support 1,000 job starts across the Highlands and Islands in a bid to reduce the skills gap.CITB Scotland engagement director Ian Hughes stressed that while the sector will “certainly face challenges heading into the new year”, the new report also showed there is “a lot of opportunity available for Scotland”.Mr Hughes said: “Despite the economic challenges, there is still huge demand for more workers in the industry and it will become even more important to retain our current workforce over the next 18 months.“There are a range of projects set to bring a steady stream of work into Scotland this year, including the new River Clyde bridge, Scottish Water’s £5 billion capital investment plans and £200 million towards Scottish Gas Networks mains replacement, to name a few.“These opportunities in the infrastructure and industrial sectors will be major drivers for growth in Scotland.”He continued: “Supporting the industry in attracting and retaining talent from right across Scotland will be our main priority, with a particular focus on training routes.“There’s no denying we have a major task ahead but I feel inspired by the resilience shown from industry over the last couple of years and look forward to supporting industry in emerging stronger when the recession ends.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Government getting ready to bail out the developers again',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Government is now considering the possibility of “advance purchasing” large numbers of private-sector apartment blocks that already have planning permission but haven’t yet been built for one reason or another. If Ministers were to proceed with this proposal, it would represent the biggest bailout of the property development sector in Irish history. The ballpark estimate is that developers have accumulated planning permission for at least 70,000 residential units – the vast majority of them apartments – granted by An Bord Pleanála or local authorities over the past four years that haven’t been “activated”. This phenomenon is at least partly due to the hoarding of land for its speculative purposes. But there is another major reason: the construction of high-rise, high-density apartments has become “economically unviable” because of higher interest rates and escalating inflation in the cost of building materials. The high-rise, high-density model – predominantly for exclusively build-to-rent (BTR) schemes – has turned out to be unbuildable due to the multiplicity of smaller apartments, generally studios or one-bedroom units, involved in most schemes. Each one requires kitchen and bathroom facilities, as well as extra fire safety precautions such as sprinkler systems. [ Frank McDonald’s future Dublin: Prepare for floods. Lose the ugly bridge. Dig an underground ] There is a bitter irony in all of this, because it was as a direct result of lobbying by the property industry that the planning system was upended in 2016 to permit developers bypass local planning authorities and make direct applications to An Bord Pleanála for large-scale housing schemes of 100 units or more. If sustainable residential communities are to be created, the BTR schemes that have planning permission would need to be redesigned to include a better mix of apartment sizes The changes were brought in by the then minister for housing Simon Coveney and they became even more prevalent after his successor, Eoghan Murphy, bowed to further pressure in 2018 and introduced mandatory ministerial planning guidelines that dumbed down apartment design standards to facilitate BTR schemes and promoted more high-rise development. These changes opened the floodgates to a torrent of applications to An Bord Pleanála for high-rise, ultra high-density apartment blocks in Dublin and elsewhere that were usually approved. [ Frank McDonald: Dundrum scheme’s overwhelming scale an indictment of the system ] The strategic housing development (SHD) process brought An Bord Pleanála, for the first time, into direct contact with developers and their agents; architects, planning consultants, chartered surveyors, structural engineers and others involved in what was aptly dubbed the “planning-industrial complex”. Its physical legacy is already visible in random high-rise eruptions on the skyline, including numerous BTR apartment blocks built at ultra-high densities. What’s waiting in the wings to be “activated” is yet more of the same type of schemes, largely comprising small flats on long corridors with no private amenity space and views out in only one direction. They are what the Government would be bringing into being if it was to embark on an “advance purchasing” programme of apartment developments with ready-to-go planning permissions, thereby “de-risking” private-sector developers – as the property lobby wants – and clearing the way for new homes to be built at scale, irrespective of their quality as places to live. The densities of many of the these unbuilt schemes are extraordinarily high. As the Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance has pointed out, these range from 330 units per hectare (uph) at Davitt Road in Inchicore to 347 uph at Clarehall on Malahide Road, 609 uph on the Circle K garage site in Donnybrook and 626 uph at Newmarket, in the Liberties. If sustainable residential communities are to be created, the BTR schemes that have planning permission would need to be redesigned to include a better mix of apartment sizes, with more two- and three-bedroom units, rather than an overwhelming preponderance of cell-like studios or one-bed apartments, intended to extract the maximum level of profit from rent. [ Frank McDonald: MetroLink will lay waste to chunks of the city centre but won’t integrate city transportation ] The Department of Housing has now revoked the “specific planning policy requirements” introduced in 2018 to permit lower design standards for BTR schemes. In a circular quietly issued to all planning authorities on December 22nd, it said “all apartment developments shall now adhere to the same standards ... regardless of the development type”. Advance purchasing of apartment blocks intended for the BTR market will also be extremely expensive, compared with units built directly by local authorities or approved housing bodies. For example, 14 two-bed social housing units in a high-rise scheme now under construction at Eglinton Road in Donnybrook were priced at €762,916 each – and that was back in 2020. It would be infinitely preferable if the Government were to adopt the latest idea put forward by industry lobby group Property Industry Ireland calling for European-style “low-rise, medium-density” housing at 40 to 80 uph as a more viable way of realising the declared objective of the National Planning Framework to achieve compact growth in cities and towns. The fact that this idea is now being put forward by the industry itself is an implicit admission that the whole SHD process – now mercifully ended – was an abject failure and that previous advocacy of the “high-rise, high-density” model helped in no small way to lead Ireland down the wrong road in terms of sustainable urban development.

       "  'text': 'Applications are open for the Niamh Burke Memorial Bursary, which will award a total of €10,000 to students pursuing studies linked to climate action and renewable energy in Ireland. The bursary was established by leading law firm Arthur Cox, in memory of their former colleague and Arthur Cox partner, Niamh Burke, who played a significant role in the development of the Irish wind energy sector and advised on some of Ireland’s largest, energy, infrastructure and construction projects. All relevant disciplines are open for consideration including law, economics, engineering, policy, science, planning and others. It is open to students planning to study in these or related fields in Ireland, at postgraduate level in 2023. If more than one person is selected, the bursary monies will be split between the successful applicants. “A year on and I still feel honoured to have been given this tremendous opportunity,” said one of last year’s winners, Aoife Stewart, from Drogheda in Louth. “The bursary provided me with vital financial support to pursue a masters in Environmental and Natural Resources law, which I am currently undertaking at University College Cork. “I have just completed the first semester of the programme and I am delighted with my decision to pursue a masters in this field. I am excited to continue my studies this year and to see where this degree leads me in the future.” Alex McLean, head of the energy and natural resource group at Arthur Cox said: “We are very pleased to continue providing this bursary in memory of our colleague Niamh Burke. Ireland has the potential to be at the forefront of the energy transition and we want to support the next generation who are working towards a carbon-neutral future.” The bursary was launched in 2020 and has already helped six people with their studies. It is funded by Arthur Cox and Niamh Burke’s family, to offer opportunities to a new generation of renewable energy experts. The fund is administered by Wind Energy Ireland. Dave Linehan, head of research, Wind Energy Ireland said: “Anything that supports and encourages academic excellence in this area is very welcome. Today’s renewable energy students will be the people making sure we reduce our CO2 emissions and work to end our dependence on foreign fossil fuels. We are supporting future leaders in Ireland’s fight against climate change.” Previous recipients have used the bursary to study at University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, NUI Galway, University College Cork, Dublin City University, and the Law Society of Ireland. Candidates can apply for the bursary until 2 March here. TechCentral Reporters Read More: renewable energy Renewables STEM students',\n",

       "  'title': 'New offices drive demand in Dublin as investors and occupiers shy away from older stock',\n",
       "  'text': 'Last year was an extraordinary year for Dublin’s office market, with take-up coming in above the long-term average, at a total of 2.64 million sq ft despite multiple disruptions and concerns, particularly in relation to global funding costs and accessibility. Demand for new space in the city centre dominated activity as occupier preference for space with the highest sustainable credentials and proximity to transport links comes to the fore. Offices located in Dublin 1 and 2 represented 70 per cent per cent of all the deals signed in 2022, with activity in the city’s north docklands particularly strong (25 per cent of total activity in 2022). While there were 37 deals signed in the final quarter, the top 10 made up 75 per cent of the total as a number of larger deals returned to the market. Deals of note in 2022 included ServiceNow’s decision to take 88,000sq ft at 60 Dawson in Dublin 2, A&L Goodbody’s decision to take 62,600sq ft at North Wall Quay, Dublin 1 and SMBC Aviation Capital’s decision to take 135,000sq ft at Fitzwilliam 28, Dublin 2. The largest deal of the year was completed in the final quarter, with Citigroup committing to a large new building in Dublin’s north docklands, which is due to complete in 2026. Prime rents ended the year at €70 per sq ft. An increase in the amount of space that has come to the “grey” market will give some occupiers more choice in 2023 and, combined with new space due to complete, is expected to result in a softening in prime rents, to €65 per sq ft by mid-year. Key factors such as a fundamentally higher funding cost environment (which is now set to remain in place), a higher cost base for construction, a dip in the office supply pipeline in 2024 and occupier preference for the best space, is expected to put a floor on rents and see a return to rental growth towards the end of 2023. While the overall Dublin market vacancy rate remains above 10 per cent as we start 2023 (and is expected to be more volatile in 2023 as grey market space is absorbed into the market), space available with Ber energy ratings of B and below will become less and less attractive to occupiers. The vacancy level that more accurately reflects the space that investors and occupiers are interested in is closer to 6 per cent. Supported by the continued performance of key sectors driving wider economic activity, Ireland remains well ahead of its euro zone counterparts, largely driven by the volume of jobs created over the 2019-2022 period, which has delivered the highest tax revenue on record. International investors researching the Dublin office market are well aware of Ireland’s strong labour market, and concerns about the impact of tech sector employment correction are being taken against this wider backdrop. Ireland is set to continue to remain of particular interest to international occupiers and investors, and while 2023 begins with a difficult global backdrop, the domestic environment is as well positioned as possible to allow for continued strong occupier activity in 2023. Professional services companies are expected to lead demand in 2023. Joan Henry is chief economist and head of research at Knight Frank Ireland',\n",

       "  'title': \"Minister Ryan launches Ireland's first all-electric town bus service in Athlone - MerrionStreet\",\n",
       "  'text': 'Athlone’s town bus service is to become Ireland’s first all-electric bus service. The service was officially launched by Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan TD in Athlone today (Friday). Operated by Ireland’s national bus company, Bus Éireann (BÉ), and funded by the Department of Transport through the National Transport Authority (NTA), physical works to transform the town bus service into a 100% electric operation began last year, with the service due to commence operations on the 29 January. The project, a €10 million investment by the NTA, is the first to launch under the Government’s Pathfinder Programme – a package of exemplar transport projects to be delivered by state agencies and local authorities around the country within the next three years. The Pathfinder Programme forms a key part of the implementation of the National Sustainable Mobility Policy, which sets out the government’s plan to meet Ireland’s requirement to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in the transport sector. This Pathfinder project, an additional investment in public transport, will see 11 new state-of-the-art electric buses operate Athlone town services. The new fleet will reduce CO2 emissions by 400,000kg annually and will deliver a quieter, cleaner bus service for the town and passengers. Over 540,000 kilometres are operated on the Athlone town bus service each year, with over 10,000 passengers now using the service weekly – a 20% increase on 2019 figures. The new buses will be charged using newly-installed charging infrastructure supplied with power from the newly-constructed electricity substation within the Bus Éireann depot on Station Road, Athlone. Construction and installation work here was carried out by ESB Smart Energy Services. In preparing for the commencement of operations, Bus Éireann drivers and mechanics have undergone a comprehensive training programme – more than 500 hours – on the driving, maintenance and operation of the new buses which will deliver emission-free public transport. Speaking at the launch, Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan said: “The launch of these new electric town buses and the electrification of the Athlone depot is important on a number of fronts. It’s important because it will give Athlone town a new, quieter, cleaner bus service. It’s important because it’s the first of our 35 Pathfinder Projects to be delivered, just months after we first launched the programme last Autumn. And it’s important because it’s a sign of exciting things to come. “Driven by our new Climate Action Plan 2023, the future of Irish transport is on the cusp of radical change for the better. And that radical change will be driven by electricity – electric buses, electric cars, electric trains, powered for the most part by our own home-grown, cheaper renewable energy in the future. “I’m also delighted that this change is starting in Athlone because the other big difference afoot is the upscaling in rural transport that is happening. In 2022, we connected 67 new towns with buses and that number will continue to climb. I would like to commend Bus Eireann and the National Transport Authority for all the work they are doing across the country, and I look forward to many more bus services and depots going electric over the coming years.” CEO of the National Transport Authority Anne Graham said:The launch of these electric buses today represents a very significant milestone on the journey to a zero-emissions fleet for our town and city bus services. “From today the people of Athlone will benefit from buses that are cleaner, quieter, more comfortable and more attractive. “Athlone will be the first service in Ireland to be delivered entirely by electric buses, and we should not underestimate the significance of that for this town and for public transport in general. “The experience we gain here with our colleagues in Bus Éireann will doubtless stand us in good stead as NTA rolls out similar programmes in Dublin and in other cities and towns in the months and years ahead.” Stephen Kent, Chief Executive Officer, Bus Éireann said: “We’re delighted to see the launch of Ireland’s first all-electric town bus service in Athlone today, demonstrating the commitment and ambition of the Government, NTA and Bus Éireann to deliver transformative sustainable public transport services across the country. “This new fleet in Athlone is a particularly welcome development for Bus Éireann as we continue on our journey to become one of the most sustainable national transport companies in Europe. The operational experience will be invaluable as we expand electric vehicles to other urban services. ”We are excited to be operating the fleet, which will deliver a more modern, sustainable and comfortable service and provide an enhanced customer experience for passengers. A smoother and quieter ride is welcome as is improved access for persons with reduced mobility. “The all-electric Athlone service will help us to make real progress towards the ambitious goals we set out in our ‘Driving Change Sustainability Strategy, 2021-2030’ to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and to have half of our urban bus fleet transition to low and zero emission vehicles by the same time.” ENDS About NTA The National Transport Authority (NTA) is a statutory non-commercial body, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Transport.

       "  'title': 'Relying on private sector to build houses a ‘vulnerability’, officials say',\n",
       "  'text': 'Reliance on the private sector to deliver housing is a “vulnerability”, particularly with 2023 delivery targets coming under pressure, the Government’s spending department has said. Concerns about the challenges in housing and other areas are contained in a briefing document prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its new minister, Paschal Donohoe who took up the role in last month’s midterm rotation in Government. The Government department pointed to problems ahead in the year, saying that the overall 2023 target of 29,000 new housing units would be “challenging” to achieve due to high construction costs, capacity constraints, rising interest rates and disruptions in the supply chain. The department said structural issues such as planning, productivity and innovation, along with high construction costs, would “continue to challenge housing supply”. [ Irish house price growth slows to 8.6% ] [ Construction slows as inflation hits sector ] There was a 14 per cent year-on-year decline in new housing units commenced in the third quarter of 2022 and, if this downward trend continues, overall completions will fall, it said. It raised doubt around whether new schemes to address vacancy – a central plank in increasing supply – would deliver the scale of supply required, given that the schemes, including the Croí Cónaithe Towns grants initiative for derelict homes, were only recently introduced. The Government’s Housing for All strategy, launched in September 2021, commits to delivering 33,000 housing units on average every year, though experts warn significantly more units will be required to address chronic supply shortages in the housing crisis. The department said there were a significant number of uncommenced apartment planning permissions, some 43,000 apartments at the end of 2021, but there were viability issues around delivering housing through build-to-rent/sell and student accommodation schemes. [ Housing crisis ‘holding us back as a country’ and ‘causing intergenerational division’ - Taoiseach ] The “complex” design of the €450 million Croí Cónaithe scheme, aimed at delivering 5,000 apartments by 2025 in otherwise unviable developments, has “meant a lower-than-anticipated interest from developers” and is “likely too small” to address the scale of viability issues. It is estimated about 6,500 new social housing units will be delivered in 2023, some 2,500 units below target. Less than 1,000 affordable units are expected to be delivered for 2022. The department said the housing assistance payment (HAP) scheme – the main scheme to house the homeless – had reached its capacity due to constraints in the private rental market. This has resulted in fewer properties being available to accommodate homeless people and the problem has been exacerbated by large numbers of private landlords leaving the market. While the department said, in the 131-page briefing document, that the temporary ban on evictions would help manage homelessness during the winter, the longer-term consequences were “likely to negatively impact the rental market and deter investment in the rental sector”. “It is critical that the rental sector is reviewed, including an examination of options to curb further exits of landlords from the market,” the department said. [ Euro zone’s construction sector in worst decline since start of pandemic ] [ First 200 modular homes for Ukrainians expected by Easter ] In the response to accommodating people fleeing the war in Ukraine, the department said the Department of Education indicated that many of the excess places in schools for Ukrainian students had been “exhausted” and that further increases would require capital investment. The Department of Education said that, as of December 22nd last, 13,753 Ukrainian pupils had been enrolled in schools, including 8,823 in primary schools and 4,930 in secondary schools. It is “anticipating significant challenges” in finding enough places for 2023, particularly at post-primary level, due to continued arrivals, the relocation of existing Ukrainian students around the country and more than 1,000 students graduating from sixth class. “The department continues to work close with the Department of Children to, where possible, match new arrivals with existing school capacity,” it said. The overall State support provided in humanitarian supports for Ukrainian refugees is expected to be about €1 billion in 2022 and between €1.6 billion and €2.2 billion in 2023.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Pure fantasy to believe our GP numbers can handle free care',\n",
       "  'text': 'Sir — The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has found that extending free GP care to everyone by 2026 can be done and would cost the State up to €881m. At that price, it sounds like a bargain — especially when you take into account the Government’s latest wheeze, to pay over €2.5bn to do remedial works on poorly built Celtic Tiger-era apartment blocks.I am acutely aware that free GP care is a key pillar of the Sláintecare health policy.However, I am bewildered as to how this will actually work in practice.At the moment, we have a population of more than five million people, but it is growing very fast. We also have about 4,000 active GPs in Ireland, but that number is reportedly going in the opposite direction.It seems to me that government proposals to extend GP care look lightweight.It has been widely reported that 25pc of GPs are over the age of 60, and this means more and more medical practices will in the future end up closing.I am left wondering whether there will be enough GPs left in this country to care for so many patients?It is my contention that the Government appears to be living in cloud cuckoo land if it believes the present and future medical workforce can actually cope with the chimera of having a free GP healthcare service.I would ask Health Minister Stephen Donnelly to explain clearly how this new free service is going to work, considering the paucity of GP practices operating currently in Ireland.Wasting time playing party political gamesSir — Ireland faces a multitude of very serious problems in areas such as (but not confined to) health, housing and homelessness. While I am apolitical, I am nevertheless perplexed and angry as to why some of our public representatives are instead focusing on a time-wasting exercise in pursuing Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe.The opposition would be better employed in trying to help solve some of the major problems facing us citizens. How much valuable Dáil time will be taken up this week just so the minister explains what can best be described as a non-event?I just wish our public representatives would for once act in a meaningful way on behalf of the electorate and stop playing their party political games.Quit throwing stones and get on with the jobSir — Certain politicians outraged at the perceived wrongdoing by Paschal Donohoe would do well to remember the biblical adage: “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.”Any possibility that some of the frenetic energy expended on stone-throwing could be redirected towards resolving the hospital crisis, asylum-seekers’ accommodation, overspend on the Children’s Hospital, children suffering hugely while waiting for essential scoliosis surgery and the energy crisis?No doubt stone-throwing is fun, but it’s unproductive. Focus on real issues for once, please.\\u200bA rather odd take from Eamon RyanSir — Last week in the Dáil, the Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said he had a “similar perspective” to the Tánaiste in regard to Paschal Donohoe.“My sense is there are questions to be answered,” he said, adding that the place where this should be done was before the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo).He went on: “I think it’s difficult sometimes to do it in the Dáil because in a sense those asking the questions may have questions asked of them in turn.’’He seems to be implying that they should all circle the wagons, keep their heads down and say nothing because they have committed the same ‘offence’’.\\u200bStorm in a teacup while Rome burnsSir — Sitting at the kitchen table after he had blown out the two candles on his birthday cake (one in the shape of a 9, the other in the shape of a 1), I asked my dad his views on the recent “six men and a van” controversy surrounding Paschal Donohoe.His responses were “honest man”, “storm in a teacup”, “scandalous waste of Dáil time with the country and the world in a state of crisis”.At 91 years of age, my dad, who has seen it all before (and who is not an avowed Fine Gaeler), just hit the nail squarely on the head.\\u200bEthics in public office not taken seriouslySir — The applause for Damien English and Paschal Donohoe at last week’s FG TDs meeting demonstrates that the ruling parties do not take ethics and misconduct in public office seriously.The constant drip of scandal is having a corrosive effect on politics. Sipo’s powers require serious revision. But can politicians be up to the task when they have skin in the game?As the political class squabbled last week over a few thousand euro, and about who is the most virtuous (none of them), the same people handed out €2.5bn because of an incompetent, deceitful and greedy building industry. It is enough to make you throw your hands up in the air with despair.\\u200bWho now gets the job to fix faulty buildings?Sir — Housing Minster Darragh O’Brien’s newly announced redress scheme for faulty apartments built during the Celtic Tiger years will cost the taxpayer an estimated €2.5bn.The builders responsible, many of whom liquidated their companies and pocketed the profits from these defective buildings, were never held to account.Will these same builders and developers — many now operating under new company names — get the job of rectifying these faulty apartments?With the Government’s housing policy in a shambles, maybe this is just a simpler way of trying to appease voters.\\u200bHousing mandarin deserves more paySir — As a citizen, I was embarrassed to read the headline in last week’s paper regarding a pay dispute for the country’s top housing civil servant (Top housing civil servant fights for pay rise to €250k).It is regrettable that when we ask such post-holders to solve our housing crisis, we cannot benchmark their salary to industry norms.In the same issue, I read reports/advertisement from the private sector construction industry. I expect the chief of such enterprises earns more that €220,000 for their lesser roles.I hope the Government better remunerates the staff charged with resolving the housing crisis.\\u200bGAA must get to grips with hand passingSir — I watched a replay of this year’s All-Ireland minor hurling final on TG4 recently — a magnificent match. The skill level from both teams was fantastic. Tipperary showed wonderful class and spirit to come back to win against all the odds.Offaly are certainly going places with that team. Their skill was extraordinary. The backs’ defending was reminiscent of the great Offaly teams of the 1980s and ’90s. The scoring, particularly from the two corner forwards, was a joy to watch. However, there was a serious issue, highlighted on your letters page by former Tipperary All-Stars Conor O’Donovan and Michael Cleary regarding the ‘throwing’ of the ball, which took from the game, particularly in the first half.The referee totally ignored this persistent fouling, so the players understandably continued.While good suggestions were put forward by Michael and by another letter writer, John Manning, to disallow hand passes altogether, I feel that would be unworkable as teams would find it easier to ‘smother’ a player, which would lead only to further rucks.Conor’s suggestion, however, to disallow the hand pass from the holding hand would be far more practical and easier to monitor by referees. The ball can be passed or moved on quickly with the hurl or the other hand.Come on, rules committee of the GAA. Get to grips with this situation immediately and make this simple adjustment to the rules to eliminate this blot from our game.\\u200bScrum caps should be essential in rugbySir — I had the pleasure last week of watching some very entertaining rugby matches. It was great to see so many talented young players coming into the game. It was also very sad to see so many players with serious or permanent ear damage.It should be compulsory to wear good scrum caps with fitted ear protection for every level of rugby, male and female. If this were to happen in a sport involving animals such as race horses, there would be uproar.So why is it acceptable for rugby players?Cannabis no quick fix to mental health issueSir — I was dismayed to read your headline last week, “Snooker, soccer and cannabis jellies: How Lynn Ruane found way to beat burnout and pulled herself back from the brink.”The headline implies that using cannabis is an effective way to treat burnout and mental health problems.I am a psychiatrist who is concerned about the mental health of young people, and I believe headlines such as this ‘normalise’ the use of cannabis and provide a poor example to our youth.There is now a great deal of scientific evidence to show cannabis use is harmful to the developing brain, and the THC component can increase the risk of psychosis and suicidality.The cannabis jellies mentioned in this piece are particularly high in THC content and are responsible for many cases of accidental poisoning in children in the US and elsewhere.I certainly agree that exercise and social connectedness are effective in tackling burnout, but substance use is not a helpful strategy.\\u200bIt’s D-Day in Dáil for abundance of TDsSir — I applaud Denis Donohue’s Letter of the Week last Sunday, with his contribution on the excessive number of TDs in Dáil Éireann. Denis showed the number of TDs was a multiple of their equivalents in other European countries.If we cast the comparison net wider, our over-representation becomes more absurd.If India was to have the same proportion of national parliamentarians to its population as we have in the Dáil, it would require 45,052 parliamentarians instead of the present 552.They say all politics are local, and this is the reason for the 160 TDs we have. Perhaps an alternative approach would be a given budget for Dáil Éireann to include the salaries and expenses of its members.It would be interesting to see how the numbers would develop if the choice was between greater numbers with reduced pay or greater pay due to reduced numbers.Turkeys arriving to ‘DWTS’ right on cueSir — There are always a few turkeys on . This year is no different.Thankfully, last Sunday I was able to switch over to the BBC to watch the concluding frames of the Masters snooker, which was excellent entertainment. Mark Williams (47) was pipped at the post by his younger opponent, Judd Trump (33).A turkey may be able to give its younger, slimmer opponent a good run for their money in the snooker, but sadly not so in a dancing competition. The public generally keep the turkeys in the competition for their own amusement and get rid of them when they are tired of laughing at them.On the other hand, the Masters turkey may yet be champion in a future competition.\\u200bRyan needs garda to be in the frameSir — Rather than having a close protection garda accompanying Green Party leader Eamon Ryan by bicycle, surely the most efficient way of cutting down emissions would be if they shared a tandem?\\u200bBig freeze shows no sign of chilling outSir — We have had some week up here in Donegal. Beautiful, freezing snow. Every day we hoped: “It will never last.”\\u200bTop level of health service is a shamblesSir — The endless shambles in the HSE is a terrible reflection on management there and in the Department of Health.I would compare the health service position to the financial crisis at the end of the Noughties. Maybe the only way to deal with the problem is to close down the entire top level of the department and the HSE and replace them with proven international experts — in the same way as the late Brian Lenihan Jr brought in financial experts to sort out the financial crisis,I’d like to see Jim O’Callaghan appointed health minister.\\u200b‘Respectable’ tag for hunting ill-deservedSir — Justice Minister Simon Harris has strongly condemned the alleged ill-treatment of horses in a sulky race on the M3.While I’m sure he has a soft spot for horses, I wish he and his colleagues would show the same compassion towards the animals that suffer in the “respectable” pursuits of fox hunting and hare coursing.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WELCOME TO HOW I Spend My Money, a series on The Journal that looks at how people in Ireland really handle their finances. We’re asking readers to keep a record of how much they earn, what they save if anything, and what they’re spending their money on over the course of one week. Are you a spender, a saver or a splurger? We’re looking for readers who will keep a money diary for a week. If you’re interested send a mail to money@thejournal.ie. We would love to hear from you. Each money diary is submitted by readers just like you. When reading and commenting, bear in mind that their situation will not be relatable for everyone, it is simply an account of a week in their shoes, so let’s be kind. I’m a single parent due to separation. I work full-time in the public health system. I live outside Dublin because I can’t afford to live in Dublin where I’m from, and I commute to work in Dublin. I have one child, a daughter, who is the apple of my eye, and most of my decisions are based around her. I also try to pursue some of my own interests and a sedate social life! I’m mostly content with my situation but I do sometimes feel the burden of one income needing to cover everything, including savings! Especially when there are large unexpected expenses, like car trouble or a problem with something in the house, etc. I’m lucky that I have a reasonably good job and I can provide for us, but I studied and worked hard and made a lot of sacrifices to get where I am. I’d be interested to see if readers had any constructive advice for me. Occupation: Health and social care professional – half as a clinician and half as a team manager Age: 38 Location: The east of the country Salary: €63,000 Monthly pay (net): €3,555 Children’s allowance: €140 – saved each month Maintenance from my child’s father: €500, but he also pays for her activities, summer holidays and is generous at birthday and Christmas Total monthly income combined (net): €4,195 Monthly expenses Transport: €130 petrol €20 for parking in work Mortgage: €1100 Childcare: €455 approx (depends a bit on my working hours, etc) Household bills: Tv/phone/broadband – €99, gas/electricity – €110, bins – €15 approx Life insurance: €20 Income protection: €140 – this is very expensive insurance to have but I feel as a single parent I really need it Car insurance: €40 House insurance: €28 Cleaner: €130 per month or €32 per week Health insurance: €1,450 per year for me and €350 for my daughter. I pay it in full, but daughter’s father contributes half of hers, so cost to me is €120 per month although I don’t pay it like that Groceries: €500 Subscriptions: Netflix – €9, Disney + – €9, Google photos – €1.99 Charity: Oxfam – €15, Focus Ireland – €15 Savings: €400 towards car fund for when I need to change it, and separate €140 for my daughter. This is the children’s allowance saved every month for her future *** Monday 6.00 am: Alarm goes off. Up and prepare my daughter’s school lunch and my own lunch for work later. I try to eat healthily and save time and money at work by not going to the canteen. Unload the dishwasher, and hang out the washing that has been done overnight. 6.45 am: I do an online yoga class for an hour (€15). I wake my daughter before jumping in for a quick shower and get dressed for work. 8.00 am: Breakfast for both of us. Help my daughter get dressed and out the door for 8.30 am. I drop her to school at 8.45 (thank God it’s local!) and by 8.50 am I’m on the road to work. 9.30 am: Arrive at work. It’s always busy after the weekend! First thing I do is scan emails, then meet the team, see how everyone is fixed, any issues arising etc. The team I work with are great. We mostly get on with our own work but help each other out as needed. As a senior team member, as complications arise I’m pulled in to try to help them out which I’m glad to do. I spend the morning catching up on emails, planning and confirming arrangements for the week ahead. Healthcare is so dynamic, there can be rapidly changing schedules. 11.00 am: I grab a coffee in our staff room at no cost to me and eat a banana I brought from home. More emails, calls and meeting prep take me to lunchtime. Lunch is short, 20 mins whilst I eat my homemade soup and toasted sandwich I prepared this morning, and a quick social catch up with the team. 12.00 pm: The afternoon is busy with clinic appointments, which take the whole afternoon. There’s no time for an afternoon break. 5.00 pm: My brain is tired so I grab a quick coffee and eat three Cadbury roses from the staff room. Bad habit really shortly before dinner, but I feel like I need an energy boost. I tend to further emails/final calls of the day. 5.45 pm: I finish up. Thankfully the worst of the traffic is gone so I get home quickly, stopping at the childminder to pick up my daughter at 6.20 pm. 6.30 pm: Home and I reheat dinner for both of us. Leftover chicken and broccoli bake I made at the weekend. Tidy up after dinner, check daughter’s homework (which is not much thankfully) to ensure it’s done properly, check her lunchbox to make sure lunch is eaten (it is!) 7.15 pm: I spend a while playing with my daughter before getting her ready for bed. Phone my sister for a chat afterwards. We make plans to try to meet up at the weekend. 8.00 pm: I watch a bit of telly whilst simultaneously scrolling through my phone, and messaging some friends. 10.30 pm: I’m tired so head to bed and listen to a podcast. Today’s total: €15.00 Tuesday 6.30 am: Time to get up. No yoga this morning, so I shower, get dressed, etc and prepare lunches for both of us. 7.00 am: I prepare dinner by putting it in the slow cooker on low. It’ll be on for 9-10 hours whilst I’m out at work. Fold and put away clothes that were drying overnight. I try to minimise what needs ironing because I pay someone to do it – this might sound like a luxury to others, but I just don’t have time to do everything myself! 7.45 am: Wake my daughter to get her ready for school. Thankfully she’s pretty good at getting up and getting ready in the morning. My daughter needs €14 for books she selected from the recent book fair at school. I also Revolut a colleague €10 (we are sending flowers to another colleague who had a baby recently). 8.30 am: Drop my daughter to school. Traffic is heavy this morning, so I’m going to be late for work! 9.30 am: I’m late for a meeting that I have started by phone from the car (thank God for Bluetooth and virtual meeting options). This is not how I like to start the day! 9.45 am: I get to work and join the meeting in person. 11.00 am: Finish the meeting and go grab a coffee in the staff room with the team. Catch up on their issues and try troubleshooting with them. 11.30 am: Finally get to my office and work on a project that’s on a tight deadline. 1.30 pm: Where did the last two hours go? I go to the staff room to get my lunch of smoked salmon and avocado on a toasted bagel, followed by a yoghurt. This was all bought during the weekly shop. Have a team meeting this afternoon, so I get takeout teas and coffees for the team. I do this the odd time, they all work so hard. Cost is €21.75! 3.00 pm: After our meeting, I spend the rest of the afternoon returning calls and emails that have piled up, and working on some of my projects. There’s a lot going on in healthcare at the moment with endless asks for inputs on different things. 5.00 pm: Leave work and collect my daughter from the childminder on the way home. We also stop to buy bread (€1.80) for school lunches for the remainder of the week. 6.00 pm: Get home. Herself is delighted with books from the book club and can’t wait to show me! I get the smell of bolognese in the slow cooker as soon as we enter the kitchen – yum. Quickly cook some spaghetti with extra for lunch tomorrow and check her homework and lunchbox – all ok. 6.30 pm: Eat dinner and tidy up afterwards. 7.00 pm: Watch some kids’ TV with my daughter. It’s mind-numbing, but she loves it when I watch this stuff with her. I simultaneously go online to do weekly grocery shopping for delivery on Friday (€111.24). It might sound a lot for such a small household but I do some batch cooking to stock up the freezer, etc and also all cosmetics, cleaning products and the like are included. 7.45 pm: After TV, we begin one of the new books at bedtime. That’s an incentive to get up to bed early! She is asleep by 8.30 pm this eve. 9.00 pm: I decide to have a bath to relax. 9.30 pm: Watch some Netflix. 10.30 pm: Head to bed and lights out for 11 pm. Today’s total: €158.79 Wednesday 6.00 am: I get up and do my online yoga class (€15). 7.00 am: Get my daughter up, shower and dress, etc. My daughter does an art class directly after school today and another mother of a child in her class collects her and brings her back to their house for a play. This is a huge help to me as it eliminates a day’s childcare for me. Although her childminder is excellent and very flexible, the cost really adds up. Little things like that make a big difference to me. I will try to get out of work a bit early today not to take advantage of the other parent’s generosity, and at Christmas I’ll gift them some wine or chocolates. 9.30 am: Drop herself to school and at work for 9.30 am. Full-on day of meetings and working on various projects, consulting with the team, etc. 1.00 pm: I heat up my spag bol and eat at my desk and work through lunch as I’ll leave about 4 pm today. 1.30 pm: After lunch, I treat myself to a cappuccino (€3.75). I also buy a birthday card and stamp to send to a friend (€4.55). It’s also my father’s birthday soon, so I order some aftershave for him (€120). My sister will probably go halves with me but I haven’t checked, and we’ll take him out for lunch on the day. I make an appointment to see my GP as I require a routine blood test for some medication I’m on. 4.45 pm: Something came up and I don’t get out of work as early as I’d hoped I would. Traffic is bad and I stop for petrol on the way (€62.47). 5.30 pm: I finally collect my daughter from her friend’s house and we get home soon after. She has been fed chicken dippers and chips. She didn’t get to finish her art work in art class and is keen to finish this now. She asks me to do some artwork too. I join in because I know how much she loves it when I do things with her, and I have the constant guilt of not having enough time with her. 7.00 pm: I make an omelette for myself and some French toast for her. I give her a bath before bed, which she also loves, and I feel like we’ve had some quality time together this evening. 8.30 pm: She’s in bed and ready to fall asleep. I phone a friend who has been asking my advice about job applications, etc. She is looking to change sectors. This call takes over an hour. It’s good to chat and to try to offer some advice to others. She says we should meet up soon for dinner and drinks which I’d like. We’re both busy working mums, it might take some weeks to get this arranged! 10:00 pm: I watch some Netflix, drink tea and eat chocolate before going to bed too late at 11.30 pm. Today’s total: €205.77 Thursday 6.00 am: I’m up and prepping for the day ahead. I’m attending a conference today and have to travel to it, so I need to be away early. 7.00 am: I wake my daughter, get her dressed and drop her to the childminder half an hour later, where she’ll have breakfast and watch TV before going to school. I’m on the train by 8 am. 9.00 am: I get to the conference for welcome tea and coffee. The conference is great but exhausting, very full on, but meet lots of interesting people. All tea, coffee and lunch included and work will pay for my parking and train ticket there. 4.30 pm: It’s been a long day. There’s a wine reception after the conference which I’d love to stay for, but can’t and actually need to leave a little early as I’ve to get home. It’s a very long day for my daughter being with the childminder both before and after school. 5.00 pm: I tend to a few work emails on the train journey home. Collect daughter at 6.15 pm who has had dinner I sent to childminder – leftover spaghetti bol. I will need to pay the childminder a bit extra this week for the longer hours. I’m very lucky she is so flexible. 6.30 pm: We arrive home. The cleaner has come today (she has a key) and I just remotely turn off the alarm and reset when she’s done. I Revolut her €32 for two hours’ work. She is a godsend, the house is sparkling! 7.00 pm: Play with my daughter for a bit, then put her to bed by 8 pm. 8.30 pm: I make myself a toasted sambo with crisps and tea as a snack (I had big lunch at the conference) and eat that whilst watching some Netflix. 10.00 pm: Tired after a long day, so I head up to bed. Today’s total: €32.00 Friday 7.00 am: I get up, prep lunches for my daughter and me, get my daughter up, etc. 8.30 am: I head to my GP appointment, the first appointment of the day. Thankfully it runs on time as I have my daughter with me and need to get her into school! Just bloods and repeat prescription so only €30 at GP, but I know the prescription will cost me €56. 8.50 am: Get my daughter to school just in the nick of time and I’m on the road to work. 9.30 am: Have a clinic this morning but shouldn’t be too busy. Intermittently popping to the office to follow up on other tasks too and grab a quick coffee and scone (brought with me) to keep me going. I take half day annual leave today – I do this occasionally to facilitate a play date. My daughter gets invited to way more than I can return due to working full time, but I think other parents are generally understanding of this. 1.30 pm: I leave work on time to collect my daughter and two friends from school. 3.00 pm: Get home with the three kids and they immediately go up to her room to play. I love having kids in the house, and to be honest, they’re all good kids although I’m supervising, because they’re happily occupied, I tend to get some of my own things done around the house. Tesco online delivery arrives and I put it away. I also make a big batch of soup that I will use for some work lunches during the week and I’ll freeze some, while the girls are ‘doing art’ at the kitchen table. 4.30 pm: I put pizza on for them, and me. They have theirs in a den they built with couch cushions, blankets etc. House is messy but I know this is a good play for them and won’t last forever! 6.30 pm: Their parents pick them up as my daughter has swim lesson this eve. It’s not great timing, but she’s one of those kids who was affected by the Covid delay in getting to start swimming lessons and there is a huge demand for a place in lessons for her age so I had to just take what I could get. It’s paid for by term (€140) so no cost today, and her father usually pays for this and other after-school activities. 8.00 pm: Home from swimming and dry daughter’s hair and get her ready for bed, do a few stories, etc. It’s been a long day. 8.30 pm: I’m really tired myself. I phone my sister and my father and we make plans to meet on Sunday. 9.00 pm: I go to bed early and read. Today’s total: €86.00 Saturday 9.15 am: Bit of a lie on this morning. I have a leisurely breakfast of pancakes and smoothies. 11.00 am: I bring my daughter to a ballet lesson paid for by her father. I sometimes go for a walk while this is on but today I just sit in the car and catch up on some life admin. 12.00 pm: After ballet, I meet a friend and her two kids in a cafe for a quick hot chocolate for the kids, and cappuccinos for mummies. We each pay our own way – €7.90 for me. We go to a local playground for a while but it’s really cold so we don’t stay too long. 1.30 pm: I head home with my daughter and we have a late lunch of sausage sandwiches! Just some downtime then till her father comes to collect her at 3 pm. He will take her overnight until around 2.30 pm tomorrow. He works abroad a lot so we don’t have a regular schedule of when he sees her, it depends on his work etc. She is due to attend a birthday party from 12-2 pm tomorrow in a play centre. He will bring her but I send her off with the birthday present wrapped (€15) and card (€1), as I wouldn’t rely on him to organise this. 3.15 pm: After my daughter leaves, I actually go to bed and set my alarm for an hour’s time – I’m that tired from the week, I feel I need it as girls’ night out planned this eve. 4.30 pm: Get up, shower and get ready to go out tonight. I always try to utilise time like tonight to have a social life, so I’ve arranged to meet my group of friends I trained in college with. There are six girls in total who maintained a friendship for years. 6.00 pm: I drive over to my friend’s house because I’ll stay with her tonight. I stop on the way to pick up a bottle of wine (€12.50) so I don’t arrive empty handed. We have a glass of wine that was meant as a gift to my friend, and then her husband drops us into town. 8.00 pm: We meet the others for cocktails before dinner. Two cocktails (€30). We go for dinner after (€70 each with drinks and tip). We debate going for another drink after, but really we’ve had enough and get a taxi home. My friend insists on paying. I must remember to get her back another time. 12.30 am: Flop into bed for sleep with no alarm clock, bliss! Today’s total: €136.40 Sunday 9.00 am: It’s bliss not having to get up when I wake up! I doze on and off till 10.30 am when I can hear my friend and her husband up. I get up and have breakfast with them. 11.00 am: Quick shower and head home. I don’t hang around as I’ve things to do and don’t want to impinge on their plans for the day. 12.00 pm: I get home and tidy up my house a bit – unload the dishwasher, put on washing, etc. I start to prepare for dinner. My father and sister will come over later this afternoon for dinner for my father’s birthday, which is actually tomorrow but we won’t get to celebrate then. I remember I have no birthday cake for him. I think about chancing some baking with herself when she gets home, which she loves to do, but then I think that I’ll be too pushed for time to do that. 1.00 pm: I nip out to a local shop to buy a cake (€6.95) and a card (€3.45). 1.30 pm: I head home, wrap the aftershave bought earlier in the week. My sister has Revoluted me €60 for the aftershave and will bring a bottle of wine with her, although no one will drink much, maybe a small glass each. If I hadn’t drunk so much last night I might have had an extra glass when I’m sitting down tonight after my daughter is in bed, but I know I won’t feel like it, as last night was enough alcohol for me. 2.40 pm: My daughter is dropped home with a party bag and full of sugar of course. She’s in good form after the party. She forgot granddaddy and her auntie were coming over. She sets about making a birthday card for him and wants to have a present herself for him. I didn’t anticipate this. I give her a large bar of chocolate already bought as part of weekly shop, and this suffices for her. We chat while I prepare dinner and she makes birthday card for grandad. 4.00 pm: Our guests arrive and we have dinner around an hour later. It’s great to have family round, it livens the place up a bit and they fuss over my daughter and she’s delighted to see them. We do cake after dinner and my daughter has to have a go blowing out the candles too. We just chat and catch up and mark the passing of another year. My mother died a few years ago so we’re all aware that life is to be celebrated. 7.15 pm: My father and sister leave and I go bathe my daughter and get her ready for bed. She’s in bed by 8.30 pm, clothes and uniform ready for the morning. 9.00 pm: I watch a bit of Netflix, send some messages and do too much scrolling before deciding to head to bed for 11 pm. Today’s total: € 10.40 Weekly subtotal: €644.36 – €60 back from my sister €584.36, but approx €200 of this (petrol, cleaner, groceries) is accounted for in my monthly budget *** What I learned - Some days my expenditure is surprisingly high. This week there was a birthday present for my father and a GP visit, but in reality, there’s something additional every week! I was so glad all went ok with my daughter’s father re Saturday night. If I had to pay a babysitter €10 per hour, it almost makes a night out prohibitively expensive, or I may have cancelled. I feel like I spend a lot on various ‘insurance’ but I consider them all necessary in my circumstances, and I have shopped around for better deals but I reckon I’m on a decent price for the cover I have. I really hate wasting food with so much food poverty and I make a conscious effort to ensure very little if any food goes in the bin in my house. I try to get the balance between spending and saving and also distinguish from essential expenditure and luxury expenditure with a night out, there was some of that here but it is needed at times. I would love to work part-time but I really can’t afford to. There always seems to be something else to pay for. That said, I think it’s good for my daughter to see her mother working and feel I’m a role model for that for her. I had the opportunity for a good education and it’s being put to use and I’m able to support myself thankfully. I’d love to be able to save a bit more and have more disposable income for holidays and clothes, etc, but overall I feel I’m managing ok. I also sometimes think about investing money rather than just saving, but I really can’t afford to lose it, and I’m clueless about this issue. I’ll be interested to see if readers have any helpful tips for me, especially anyone in a similar situation.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Expect more of the same, only with more urgency in the final stretch of this Dáil term, according to the Dublin Bay South TD and long-time leader of the Green Party. “We are in a very good place in terms of doing a lot of the work in the last two years to set things up,” he says. “We have a very good climate law which we introduced a year and a half ago. Last summer, we set up sectoral targets of specific ambition in energy and transport and agriculture, and so on. And then, only a month ago, it became really more detailed, a real plan in terms of how we have to deliver it. “So for me, it’s all about delivery. Firstly we don’t have any choice. Failure is not an option because of the nature of this Irish law but also the reality of European law and European policies that are perhaps even more ambitious, in terms of scale and speed, and need for change. “Also, I would argue this is going to be good for the country. It’s not a hardship, it’s a positive development, and solutions on the climate side will be good for us. “It will be good for security, it will be good for creating employment, it’s good for Irish agriculture.” Mr Ryan concedes the level of change needed will be difficult. Change is never easy, especially the scale of this change. I think in the next two years, it’s all about delivery — housing and health reform as well as climate “They are connected because what we do in housing can and will be good for climate if we got it right. Absolutely.” Retrofitting One such challenge that brings together climate targets, housing, and health into one strand is that of retrofitting homes. There has been criticism of the slow progress so far, despite lofty ambitions and targets up to the end of the decade. The Government announced a national retrofitting scheme last February at a cost of €8bn, which aims to upgrade 75,000 homes every year from 2026 to 2030, with an overall target of 500,000. According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) at the end of October, more than 36,000 applications were received by it across its schemes, and all are experiencing significant levels of demand from homeowners. This equates to approximately 28,800 homes being retrofitted, the SEAI said. Homeowners typically have a period of eight months to complete works once approved, and there are constraints on delivery at the present time, it added. There are different schemes, which has led to confusion among homeowners and political figures alike as to the application process, while fewer than two dozen firms are actually hired or in the process of being hired to carry out the works — an enormous workload for such a small pool. Mr Ryan defended the pace of the national retrofitting programme, saying it has been only running for less than a year. “It’s starting to deliver. We did deliver on what our targets were. We delivered last year around 27,000 upgrades. Minister for Higher Education, Simon Harris, was telling me that we are seeing a huge increase in training and apprenticeships, about 2,000 have applied. You talk to people in the industry — they’re flat out, they’ve never been busier. The great thing about the national retrofitting programme we introduced last February is that they know the money is there for the next 10 years. They [firms] can invest, they can hire, they can go out and promote confidence that the funding will be there and that the political commitment is there. He defended the low number of ‘one-stop shops’ assigned by the SEAI to carry out the retrofitting programme. Mr Ryan said: “They are ramping up, and they’re not small firms — this is the likes of ESB and Scottish and Southern (SSE) — they’re not companies without scaling up capabilities. It does take time. “Last year was only the start, it was always a warming up. We have delivered roughly the scale and speed that we expected. We will go this year to 37,000 houses being upgraded, and up again the year after that. It’s delivering, the way I see it.” Infrastructure The glacial pace of planning of key infrastructure around the country is frustrating, the Environment and Transport Minister acknowledged. Housing and transport are the casualties, despite being huge social issues, he added. “We’re not moving fast enough, that is clear. I’ll give you an example. If you look at any assessment, it’s taken us roughly 10 years on the current system to deliver a bus corridor. It’s probably taking about 20 years to deliver a railway line, and similar in housing. It’s our biggest problem. “We have a lot of projects now that have had planning permission but they’re not being built. So we need speed in so many different areas and quicker changes. Sustainable transport “One of the things we’re doing is sustainable mobility in the transport side. We set up a task force to look at how we can accelerate everything. We’re focusing very much on the next three years. “I’ve rang every county council manager around the country, all 42 councils. I said to the managers, ‘can you give me examples of projects we could deliver in the next three years?’ I said we’ll fund them and we’ll make sure that it gets real attention to try and get through planning, to try and get all the support the State can give to make it happen.” It led to around 70 applications, he said. “We have picked 35 on a scientific basis in terms of the ones we think are most demonstrative projects and so on. And it’s all about how do we deliver the next three years. So for example, in Limerick, putting a train station in Moyross because there we’ve got huge areas of State land where we could put in new housing if we had a good public transport system. So build it. “In Waterford, move the railway line and station and suspension bridge — and these things are happening now — so that you develop the north quays, the Ferrybank side. “That is a housing as well as a transport development project. “In Galway city, to deliver the cross-city bus route that would start to address the chronic transport problems that they have, everyone living on one side of the city and working on the other side and having a real difficulty kind of making the city function. They’re just some of the examples.” If some local authorities can’t deliver, the department will move on to one that will, he warned. “If councils feel they can’t do it and they won’t do it — because these are difficult, a lot of decisions such as Galway are going to be difficult because it means taking road space and giving priority to buses and cycling and walking, and that can be controversial — we will say ‘OK, fine, we’ll take that project out and we’ll provide that funding to another council to do something else instead’. “We need to incentivise councils to act fast because the truth is that for a variety of complex reasons, including our planning system, complication in that and so on, it takes too long. “By taking such length of time, it’s costing the public a lot more, not only in terms of increased cost of construction, but also the loss in having better transport infrastructure better local community, better housing, more housing.” Forestry The minister has acknowledged the anger over plans by State-owned commercial forestry body Coillte to sell thousands of acres of rural Ireland to British investment fund Gresham House as part of an afforestation deal. “I do understand the disquiet. I think we have to really focus on how we get forestry right, not only in the number of hectares that we grow, but the type of forestry for better biodiversity as well as storage of carbon. “One of the real constraints here is around a decision by the European Commission back in 2003, which said that Coillte couldn’t avail of the grants and premiums that apply in afforestation. And it’s very hard without those grants and premiums because there’s significant upfront costs, and you’re competing with others who will be able to access those premiums.” Mr Ryan said he will consult with Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Pippa Hackett, on the European Commission implications. “I know she probably will agree with me on this, we should go further and I know her department and Coillte have already started questioning with the European Commission whether there a variation on that state aid rule, which would allow us invest in our land, Coillte to invest in a forestation in a way that doesn’t fall afoul of the European legislation. “That would transform what’s possible.” There is also a need to look at other funding mechanisms including State funding to develop forestry which is closer to nature, with much more emphasis on biodiversity rather than timber production, he said. “That’s happening, and Coillte has committed 50% of their afforestation and developments to be in that type of forestry. And that’s the one that I think we really need to focus on and deliver and develop at scale.” Such plans have started, albeit on a small scale, he said. “Scaling that up, I think is one of the things that where, with environmental movements and others, there is real agreement.” The forestry programme agreed by Government in November and the €1.3bn behind it is also vital, he said. “It is all directed at getting farmers to plant land and to promote agroforestry and the use of riparian forestry strips within farms that have real benefits in improving the local environment, providing the farm with a steady supply of timber for its own needs, and also really restoring biodiversity as well as storing carbon.” Agricultural emissions Mr Ryan and his party have come under sustained fire from sectors of agriculture since entering Government, with some perceiving the Greens to be stifling traditional farming. The Green Party is an ally of farmers, Mr Ryan insisted. “My sense is that there’s real change happening in Irish farming. Since the Greens have been in government, there has been a threefold increase in the amount of organic farming and its only going further up, particularly with the high price of fertiliser in the last few years. “There is huge interest in farming and, similarly, if you look at the number of farmers who have applied for this new environmental scheme, the Acres Scheme, it is way above anything previously. So I think the narrative of farmers versus the environment is wrong. The reality, what’s happened on the ground is farmers are realising this is the future. “This is where the income is. This can use their skills in a way that’s really beneficial and productive. And it’s happening — we’re seeing the numbers climbing from environmental schemes and agriculture, organic schemes, that we’ve never seen before. I think we’ll see the same in forestry, particularly with the much higher premiums that are applying for those sorts of environmentally sensitive farming systems. I expect them to take off.” Public support Mr Ryan said he believes the Irish people “want to play their part” and “won’t turn their back” on so-called climate refugees. Integration Minister Roderic O'Gorman said earlier this month that the asylum system will have to be expanded to include a new category for people fleeing the effects of climate change — comments which former justice minister Charlie Flanagan criticised as “making policy on the hoof”. In relation to climate refugees, Mr Ryan said: “I think the Irish people have a real sense of understanding and a sense of care for what is happening in the world — for playing our role, small as we are. We can’t solve all the world’s problems, we’re not responsible for doing so, but I think by and large that the Irish people want to play their part proportionately and fairly.” He rebuffed Mr Flanagan’s comment. “The chair of the Oireachtas foreign affairs committee [Mr Flanagan] may have misunderstood what was said, and certainly I don’t think it is correct what he said about “policy on the hoof” in how we manage climate refugees. “What Roderic said is clearly and absolutely correct. This is something that must be considered at an international level, particularly Europe. We don’t decide this on our own, it is decided as part of international agreements, and rightly so.” Ireland “has to manage it”, Mr Ryan said, adding that he was personally affected listening to Pakistan’s environment minister speaking about last year’s devastating floods, described as the most damaging in its history. “The truth is that we are already starting to see, for example, in Pakistan last year — up to 30m affected. I met the Pakistani minister at Cop27 in Egypt, and it was heartfelt and heartrending when you heard the scale of destruction that occurred. “Climate change is everywhere. You can’t ignore it and you can’t stop it. We will manage it as part of an international effort. We’re not like Atlas carrying the world on our shoulder but I think Irish people want to play their part, and want to be part of a world where we start to care for the environment and to care for the planet. Where those consequences are inevitable, we won’t turn our back.”\",\n",

       "  'text': 'When Weston Clendinning moved from Co Armagh to London in the hope of furthering his music career, he hadn’t expected it to take several months to find somewhere to live. The 26-year-old singer and guitarist moved over with a friend in September 2021, with his car, not realising it would in fact become their home for at least a month. “We basically ate at Wetherspoons every day,” he laughs. Clendinning had already spent months looking for places online but thought he hadn’t been successful in finding somewhere due to not being available for viewings. “We viewed endless amounts of houses and we ended up offering places six months in advance and they were still turning us down,” he says. “We eventually found a one-bed flat in Fulham, where we had to pay six months upfront, I slept on the kitchen floor, and my friend slept in the bedroom.” Clendinning isn’t the only Irish expat who has found themselves in this situation. Private rents in the United Kingdom are growing at the fastest annual rate since 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). London has been hit the hardest, with the median monthly rent in the capital now nearly twice that of the rest of England. According to property site Rightmove, the average advertised rent in London is now £2,343 (€2,674) a month. According to flat sharing website Spareroom there are now seven renters for every room available in London. Rising rents coupled with people returning to the city following the pandemic has fuelled London’s housing crisis. “It took my girlfriend about five or six months for her and her sister to get somewhere and she was on the verge of having to quit her job and move back because she couldn’t get accommodation,” Clendinning says. “The prices were through the roof. You had two girls that both had normal jobs making £30,000 a year salary [and] weren’t making the threshold to find anywhere semi-liveable. “They had to ask for help to get six months rent upfront before they eventually found somewhere where they’re now having to pay £2,500 a month for a normal enough house.” Cost-of-living crisis Finding accommodation isn’t the only issue in the city, the cost-of-living crisis has also made life in London less accessible for many Irish expats. Emma McManus (28) from Leixlip, Co Kildare, says she is unable to save at all at the moment and is terrified to put the heating on. “You’re more hyperalert, I guess,” she says. “I’m also not able to fly home as much as I used to. The flights aren’t as cheap as they used to be, you’re looking at an extra £100 in a month if you’re wanting to fly home.” McManus, who works for an ending violence against women and girls charity, says her sector is poorly paid but they are not in it for the money. That said, she has seen many colleagues with families struggling. “We’re supporting our clients who are financially abused, in hardship and poverty, we’re getting them foodbank vouchers and things like that but then we’re having to do the same ourselves. Some of my colleagues are having to go to foodbanks as well, especially those who have kids.” However, although the price of living in London is a concern, McManus said the city is full of opportunity. “The cost-of-living crisis is showing how low paid people are and how we actually need to stand up in solidarity. There’s a bit of social change happening with it too which I think will be positive long term.” Living from pay cheque to pay cheque Kate Gunnar (29), from Co Kilkenny, says she moved to Tooting in June 2021 for a change of scenery but was shocked by how expensive it is to live there. “I was a primary school teacher and taught in Dublin for three years but I wanted something different,” she says. When she first moved to the capital she did some supply teaching and office administration before landing a HR role at an Irish construction company. “I signed my contract on a really low salary of £28,000 thinking it would be okay. It was fine for the first few months but then in April things started to go up, like our electricity bill. “I wasn’t even spending money on socialising, it was just getting the Tube into work and that was costing me around £250 a month. I was continuously going into my overdraft and I had even saved up a bit from teaching. I was considering moving back to Ireland as things weren’t feasible.” Gunnar eventually changed jobs and is now working for a law firm for a better salary. “Going up in salary has helped so much, I feel I can breathe again,” she says. “I never want to be in that situation again going from pay cheque to pay cheque. The opportunities are keeping me here and the social life in London, however, I’m not sure how much longer I will stay here. If someone was moving over now I would tell them they would need to be on a good graduate salary.” ‘London has more to offer than Dublin’ Mark Byrne (29), a charity worker from Dublin moved to Croydon in March 2022, after stints working in Calais and the Balkans. “I was living in Dublin till 2019, then I chose to leave to go volunteering as I was finding it too difficult to live there with the rental crisis,” he says. “I thought I would try to go travelling and find my feet somewhere else and then the pandemic hit. After Calais, my girlfriend and I both moved to London.” Byrne now works for Refugee Support in London and questions his move but says the city brings a lot more opportunities for his line of work. “I do question my move to London because I left Dublin as it was so expensive and I couldn’t find somewhere to live properly. Now I’ve ended up going to London which is equally expensive and it’s still hard to find places to live. “I feel I’ve made a bit of a lateral move. In London, in this line of work that I do, there’s definitely a lot more available over here than in Ireland. With this sector of work, salaries are a bit lower so there is also the financial struggle that goes with getting to work in what you like but being in a very expensive city. London has more to offer than Dublin in terms of things to do, [but] I still prefer Dublin culture.” Meanwhile, Clendinning is adamant that there is no place like London for new opportunities as a musician. “I love London from a music perspective, there are so many people there trying to be the best they can be musically. It seems to attract a lot of passionate people.” Since his move, he recorded at Eastcote Studios in Kensal Town with a producer who has worked with the Coronas and Razorlight. “At Eastcote studios it’s wonderful to be immersed in that kind of environment, to be surrounded by people with the same dreams. Not only that but people who have lived their dreams. I’m still very much a dreamer.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'The world of work has undergone significant changes in recent years. The pandemic-induced move to remote working has spurred a worldwide shift in how we view and do our jobs , with many companies now allowing home working on a full-time or part-time basis forever more. In addition, advancing technologies means the needs of the labour force are constantly changing and evolving. While twenty years ago many young people were able to gain employment without a university degree, things have changed completely, with some jobs now requiring at least a Master’s Degree. While these changes might seem frightening, they can create new and exciting opportunities for students and graduates who see these trends in advance and upskill in these areas. Leo Clancy, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, said there is significant demand for employees trained in sustainability, climate and agritech in the State, as the country — and the world — seeks to become more proactive in terms of climate action. Digital technologies continue to be strong performers in the workforce too, he said, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, data science and robotic engineering. Mr Clancy said the “biggest underlying challenge” for businesses is meeting the labour and skills needs. While that creates a challenge for the companies themselves, “therein lies our opportunity” for those preparing to enter the workforce, he said . Maureen Lynch, operations director at Hays Ireland recruitment agency, said current indications suggest that all specialist areas will be recruiting in the coming years, such as technology, finance, banking, construction, engineering and life sciences. “However, the requirements will evolve as will the technical elements of these specialist areas. Never has it been truer that we are now living in a world of lifelong-learning,” she said. As a result, the key to carving out a successful career in this evolving landscape is to try to understand the needs of a marketplace and align training to meet those needs. But how is one to do that? We’ve compiled some ideas of resources that would help a student who is trying to ascertain what jobs will be available around the time of their graduation. Media Reading widely has many benefits, but especially when it comes to determining upcoming changes in the workplace. Often specialised journalists pick up on emerging trends earlier than an average person, with many publications having specific sections on the economy, jobs market and issues arising for businesses. The trick with getting the most out of media is to read across many different publications, both national and international. Harvard Business Review is a good online resource, while the likes of The Guardian, The New York Times and The Irish Times often report on the workplace and labour market trends. There are also some specialist publications that can provide niche information. For example, Made in Ireland is a bi-monthly magazine on technological innovation, news and the latest developments in the engineering and manufacturing sectors. It would be an invaluable resource for those seeking to build a long-term career in the area. Jobs listings Most jobs are now advertised online, making it easier than ever to see what work is on offer. There are so many websites specifically for advertising employment opportunities, such as Indeed.com, jobs.ie or monster.ie. If you keep an eye on the postings, you might notice emerging trends. For example, a quick look on one of the websites shows a number of advertisements for engineers and senior management roles. OECD The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website features an iLibrary on its website that provides invaluable insight on employment figures and labour market changes across a wide variety of regions, from Europe to Australia or Canada. Particularly beneficial if a student is considering pursuing work abroad after graduation, it provides research, ebooks, articles and publications offering insights to gauge global demand for certain skills or occupations. The Central Statistics Office The CSO publishes quarterly labour force surveys that feature comprehensive detail on the world of work in Ireland. While documenting the numbers in employment and unemployment, it also analyses which sectors have an increasing number of employees in active work, and which have decreasing levels of productivity. According to the most recent publication, from quarter three in 2022, employment growth was particularly strong in sectors such as construction, accommodation, and food and education. In terms of more specific occupations, there was an increase in those employed in professional occupations, skilled trades— such as chefs or construction workers — and personal services such as care workers. Pay Money is obviously a big influencing factor when deciding what job to take and what field to go into. If youare interested in figuring out just how much you could earn in a job after graduation, the website payscale.com could be of assistance. The website enables users to research and compare average salaries for various roles and get a snapshot of current market wages in Ireland through online tools and software. Recruitment Agencies Those who are consistently asked to fill roles know exactly what employers are looking for. Ireland has a myriad of recruitment agencies, many of whom send out insights via email or social media. It is worth either subscribing to those updates, following their online accounts or t contacting the agencies directly to see what information they might be able to provide to you about the jobs landscape. Ms Lynch said that, for example, Hays Ireland has a blog on its website that is regularly updated with “the latest information about emerging prospects in the world of work”. Networking Meeting people and talking to them is almost always the best way to learn new things. Schools tend to invite speakers in for sixth years, so they can hear more about universities or places of work. In university, there are often conferences organised. Students should attend these and try to speak with the guest speakers after. Ms Lynch said graduates and students should talk to as many people as possible within their preferred field. “This will give you a greater understanding of the reality of a role, the career prospects, challenges and opportunities in a given career. Critically, it will also help you grow your professional network, something that will always stand to you later on in your career,” she said. “The good news is that most people are happy to help and make themselves available for a coffee or a Zoom call.” Social media Social media dominates almost all other aspects of our lives, so it’s really no wonder that it can play a role in the workplace too. LinkedIn is probably the most obvious platform that ties into work. Request to connect with people working in industries in which you might like to pursue a career, see what they post and if they highlight any issues or opportunities. This interconnectivity shows the need to ensure that a student’s LinkedIn profile is up-to-date, professional and accurate, Ms Lynch added. Solas The State agency responsible for overseeing the further education and training sector in Ireland, Solas often works with the National Skills Council. The council regularly puts out skills bulletins, which are easily accessible online. The bulletins give a labour market overview, employment permits, vacancies and profiles of various occupational employment profiles.',\n",

       "  'text': 'With unemployment levels at record lows, there are lots of reasons for students transitioning from second to third-level education to feel confident about their career prospects when they finally take that leap into the jobs market. Notwithstanding the many issues facing young people nowadays – not least the seemingly impossible prospect of someday owning a home – getting on the job ladder has scarcely ever seemed more manageable. But what can the students embarking on the start of third-level education today expect when that day finally arrives? The first thing to say, according to Sharon McCooey, head of LinkedIn Ireland, is that “the only certainty in life is uncertainty”, as she points to events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war in recent years. “The first piece of advice I give anyone thinking about what course to study at university is that many job opportunities available today are very different from a decade ago,” she says. “What students need to keep in mind is that they are at the beginning of a journey of lifelong learning. Key to that journey is an adaptable mindset as the reality is today’s graduates are likely to change careers multiple times over their lifetime.” Her sentiments are shared by Pawel Adrjan, an economist and director of EMEA economic research at jobs website Indeed. “If the past few years have taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected,” he says. “So while some areas look set for increased demand over coming years, the best thing an early careerist can do is make sure they get a broad range of experience early on. A degree can be a jumping off point and does not necessarily dictate what you have to do for the rest of your life. “Take stock of your values, skills and aptitudes. Look at the key skills that your degree gives you, and then look at where they best transfer. That will help you map out avenues you might like to explore in your career. “It’s also important to identify what your priorities are when looking for a job. Is salary key or would you be willing to trade off for more flexibility? What learning opportunities would you like to access? Would you like to travel or work from a certain location? “These priorities are likely to change throughout your career so it’s good to check in with yourself regularly as your priorities shift.” Undergraduate course selection is the first chapter in your career story rather than a high-pressure lifelong decision— Brendan Lally, University of Limerick careers adviser University of Limerick (UL) careers adviser Brendan Lally also acknowledges the uncertainties with predicting the future jobs market, but says school leavers “should expect lifelong learning to include upskilling and re-skilling with multiple career changes as people work longer”. “What you’re good at now and what your parents and teachers have helped you identify as your strengths is just a starting point,” he says. “Undergraduate course selection is more a first chapter in your career story rather than a high-pressure lifelong decision. “There are current students at the University of Limerick and other campuses around the country studying for careers that may not exist yet or will be radically different in 10 years’ time. “Many of next year’s first years in higher education will study for careers that have yet to be defined. So, students preparing for third-level must be more conscious of the world they live in rather than just their world.” Lally points to Government reports of “future skills needs” that can provide useful information for those making choices and which give rise to in-demand courses. “They give good indications of what can be expected and point to growth in green technology, bio medical and bio pharma,” he says. “The upward trajectory of tech and, in particular, the challenges around privacy and cyber security point to other rapid growth areas. Demographics point to an ageing population, with challenges around care and health. “Engineering will continue to advance with automation, robotics and machine learning, and the impact of AI and big data to name but a few.” LinkedIn’s McCooey agrees that areas such as the green economy are likely to be bountiful hunting grounds for jobseekers down the tracks. “Obviously there are industries like technology and pharma that are in high demand, as well as more traditional industries that will always be hiring such as the legal and engineering sectors,” she says. “For example, one of the most popular roles advertised on LinkedIn last year was for software engineers. “Naturally sectors like the tech, healthcare and legal sectors will continue to need large pipelines of talent, but we will also see new areas emerge, particularly in the green economy. “Looking at the area of climate change, it’s obvious that many industries need to change and there will be opportunities across the board, whether it is a reimagining of traditional areas like the boom in retrofitting in the construction sector or a future demand for expertise about renewable energy sources like wind turbines. “In the past five years, the number of renewables and environment jobs in the US has increased by 237 per cent. We expect a similar boom in demand in Ireland.” McCooey says the five fastest growing green jobs between 2016 and 2021 were sustainability managers, wind turbine technicians, solar consultants, ecologists, and environmental health and safety specialists. Indeed’s Adrjan says demand for healthcare roles – which was boosted by the pandemic – will persevere in the years ahead. “Since the pandemic we have seen consistent high demand across essential services such as healthcare – at the moment therapy, pharmacy and home care are particularly in demand,” he says. “When trying to predict a prosperous career path, one thing to look at is currently pressing problems or developing areas – environmental issues, socio economic development, digital connectivity – these can be a good predictor of where demand will lie. “Trends indicate demand for remote work will continue in office-based roles, which means that graduates may need to prepare to enter a new hybrid workforce, and must be ready to adapt to that style of working from the outset.” If you take the same role from 2015 to 2022, roughly 25 per cent of the skills that are required for that role have changed— Sharon McCooey, head of LinkedIn Ireland Most of the experts agree that the best thing students can do as they begin life at third-level education is to build a bank of transferrable skills rather than worrying too much about the specifics of what they are doing. “If you have an obvious interest in an area like tech or law, obviously pursue your passion,” says McCooey. “If it’s a case, however, that you are simply choosing a course based on a greater chance of getting employed once you graduate, it is important to know that you can always study something that you enjoy and then add extra qualifications or learn additional skills required for a role. “Employers are rethinking hiring and increasingly placing greater emphasis on a candidate’s skills and overall potential to ensure great talent is not overlooked. This is actually a really important consideration for very specialised areas. “For example, AI is a sector that’s on the rise, but the pipeline of talent available is quite small, so most organisations have to rely on professionals transitioning into the space,” McCooey says. “Recent LinkedIn data shows us that if you take the same role from 2015 to 2022, roughly 25 per cent of the skills that are required for that role have changed. “For example, Jira, Kubernetes and Python were among the top 10 skills added by LinkedIn members in the IT sector during 2021 contrasting with more traditional skills like SQL, JavaScript and Software Development topping the list back in 2015. “Ultimately, a key takeaway for any student is that you do not stop your education journey when you graduate. “By the time this generation enters the workforce, hiring practices will be reimagined in that the focus will not simply be on your degree – recruiters will be looking at your core skills and how adaptable you are.” UL’s Lally pushes the importance that school leavers understand that deep learning, even in big demand disciplines, is not enough to ensure guaranteed future success. “In higher education what defines success can often be viewed as the grade you come out with at the end,” he says. “Graduate recruiters in organisations will define success more broadly. “In your final year, graduate employers will want you to show them evidence and examples of your ability and transferable skills. Skills required can include evidence of collaboration, resilience, learning agility, growth mind-set, critical analysis, initiative, drive and adaptability. “Much of this will be determined by what you do outside the classroom and lecture theatre. My tip for reaching your career goals is not only to study hard... Your future employment and life prospects will improve with experiences such as a work placement, a study abroad Erasmus experience with foreign language opportunity, part-time jobs, sports participation, campus societies and volunteering. “These will allow you to take ownership and demonstrate skills and ability. Balancing your time for all of this is difficult, but prospective employers recognise this and target those that do it well.” Lally advises students at this point in their journeys to devote one hour per week to their “own personal career education”. “Your college career service and website will have everything you need, to plan ahead,” he says. They can help you with self-awareness; job market analysis; how best to present yourself; and how to understand how employers will assess you.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Private sector delivering more than seven in 10 new social homes, department figures show',\n",
       "  'text': 'More than two-thirds of the social housing units delivered in the first nine months of last year were procured directly from private developers, underscoring the State’s reliance on the private sector to deliver housing. Figures obtained from the Department of Housing show that 2,706 new-build social homes were delivered up to the end of September last year. Of these, 1,946 units (72 per cent) were acquired by way of so-called turnkey purchases – where the local authority or approved housing body (AHB) enters into a forward-purchasing arrangement with a private developer – or through the Part V rule, which stipulates developers must set aside a certain portion of their developments for social housing. [ IDA officials anxious about impact of housing crisis on inward investment, emails show ] Turnkeys represented 54 per cent (1,452) of the total while Part Vs represented 18 per cent (294). Twenty-eight per cent (760 homes) were delivered directly by local authorities via the Social Housing Capital Investment Programme or by approved housing bodies through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility. The figures were provided by Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien in response to a parliamentary question from Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin. Mr Ó Broin said: “Turnkeys in and of themselves are not a problem but the heavy overreliance on private developers to deliver social housing is very risky.” The core problem was the level of red tape imposed on local authorities doing their own developments, he said. “Until the Government fixes that red tape, there will be a perverse incentive to continue overrelying on private developers,” Mr Ó Broin said. “And at a time when commencements are falling, that’s a high-risk strategy.” [ Relying on private sector to build houses a ‘vulnerability’, officials say ] Reliance on the private sector to deliver housing was highlighted as a “vulnerability” in a briefing document prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its new Minister, Paschal Donohoe, when he took up the role last month. The document highlighted structural issues such as planning and construction costs as a “challenge” to delivery of Government targets. It estimated that up to 6,500 social homes would be delivered in 2022 (the end-year figures have not been released yet), down from a target of 8,000. But even this figure may be at risk with just 2,706 delivered in the first nine months of 2022. With new housing commencements falling, department officials raised concern that housing targets would continue to come under pressure. There was a 14 per cent year-on-year decline in new housing units commenced in the third quarter of 2022, which industry officials and analysts linked to the rapid acceleration in build costs. In his response to Mr Ó Broin, Mr O’Brien said: “Housing for All is the Government’s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade. “This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over €4 billion per annum, through an overall combination of €12 billion in direct exchequer funding, €3.5 billion in funding through the Land Development Agency and €5 billion funding through the Housing Finance Agency,” he said.',\n",

       "  'text': 'People who know Michael Stone - or Mick, as he is known to those close to him - say he has sounded shell-shocked over Paschal Donohoe’s election posters controversy. For a very private individual who takes great pride in working hard, below the radar, being at the centre of a political and media storm is not somewhere where the 54-year-old Dubliner likes to be. This is behind his decision to stand down from two public roles, as chairman of the North East Inner City Programme Implementation Board and as a board member of the Land Development Agency, after admitting that he helped his friend, Paschal Donohoe, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, erected posters in a second general election, in 2020. Stone said in a statement on Tuesday morning that he did not want the controversy to be “a distraction” from the “very important” work of the two bodies. “I think he is feeling pretty sore. I think he just feels that no good deed goes unpunished,” said one person who knows him and has worked closely with him. “He just feels like people are talking about him and he likes to fly below the radar. I think he is finding it pretty difficult.” Donohoe admitted omitting a sum of €1,057 from his 2016 general election expenses covering the use of a van provided by a company run by Stone and the payment of six workers to erect election posters in the Fine Gael Minister’s Dublin Central constituency in the election. In Stone’s statement on Tuesday, he said he had mistakenly told Donohoe - in December and again last week- that he had not provided the politician with help on postering in the 2020 general election only to later discover that he had when he “re-checked” the matter. He apologised to Donohoe and confirmed that he, through a member of the Fine Gael team in Dublin Central, personally paid for six people to poster at a cost of €972 and for supplying some of the individuals with vans for the postering work at a commercial value of €434.20. “I deeply regret any embarrassment that I have caused Paschal for my mistaken recollection in relation to 2020 and for what I thought was modest help for hardworking honest politician,” said Stone. Pocket change The sums involved must seem like pocket change to the successful businessman. He owns The Design Group, a mechanical and electrical engineering business he founded in 1992. The “mech-and-elec” people are the ones who come in to fit out a property once built. The business recorded a turnover of €175 million and a profit of almost €18 million in the year to the end of March last, according to its latest accounts. It ended the year with cash of €36 million. The group pocketed a one-off gain of €15 million during the year, selling the remaining 50 per cent of its facilities management division to Sisk, a joint venture partner since 2019. The Design Group employs more than 700 people and works on projects in Ireland, the UK, Africa, Europe and North America. Among its projects are the refit of the Shelbourne Hotel, the Technology University Dublin campus at Grangegorman in Donohoe’s own constituency, work on Dublin Castle prior to Ireland’s EU presidency in 2013 and the Qantas lounge at Heathrow Airport in London. The company’s work on commercial properties, data centres and life sciences facilities and for bluechip clients ranging from Amazon to Microsoft to Hilton means that the Dublin 11-registered business has performed exceptionally well in recent years. The success of the group is a long way from Stone’s humble beginnings, growing up on Aughrim Street in Dublin. The proud inner-city Dubliner started working as an apprentice at the ESB while still a teenager. He was identified by the semi-state as a high-flier who was given the electrical training that has stood to him when it came time to setting up his own business. That decision came when he was 24. He has admitted that if had stayed another couple of years at the ESB, it would have become a job for life. Instead he wanted to break out on his own. “But the opportunity was there and I’m very ambitious. I love work. A semi-state body was probably a bit restrictive for me. I wanted that feeling of being my own boss. I had just got married and not long afterwards my first child was born. If I had left it until after that I would been too afraid,” he said. The Design Group’s expansion internationally before the 2008 property crash meant that it weathered the economic storm that took out many other companies in the construction sector. The reach of his company brought profile and standing for Stone in the industry. He served as president of the Electrical Contractors’ Association and of the Mechanical Engineering & Building Services Contractors Association before stepping up to become president of the powerful lobby group, the Construction Industry Federation, between 2014 and 2016. Dogged work ethic Commercial success has brought personal wealth. Last year, he paid €4.6 million for a house on Killiney Hill designed by Irish architect Jack O’Hare, an apprentice of the famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The home has panoramic views of Killiney Bay and is set on more than an acre of gardens amid some of the country’s most expensive postcodes. Outside of work, he is a lifelong GAA fan. Stone played senior inter-county hurling for Dublin and is a member of Eoghan Rua GAA club, now amalgamated with Oliver Plunketts. Friends talk about Stone’s impressive levels of energy and focus, and how has brought the dogged work ethic that made his business such a success into the two public roles. As chairman of the North East Inner City Programme Implementation Board, he oversaw the area’s social and economic regeneration, a project close to his heart given his roots in the area. “Mick Stone is a massive loss for Dublin’s north east inner city,” said Feargal O’Rourke, managing partner at PWC Ireland and a member of the board. “As a member, I have seen first hand his role on the Inner City group and he has done more in recent years for this area than anyone else in the country. He is very hands on and has put hundreds of hours in to improve the area and the lot of the people living there, without any personal agenda or compensation. He will simply be impossible to replace.” Stone joined the board of the State’s Land Development Authority in 2019 in an appointment made by the then minister for housing Eoghan Murphy. He received no fees for his role on the inner-city programme and has waived his yearly fee of €15,759 from the LDA. In a sign of Stone’s diligence, one colleague at the LDA remembers him video-calling into a meeting of the board while he was on a business trip to Mexico at about 4am local time. Above and beyond “He goes way above and beyond and in that sense he really does have the public service ethos and is very committed to both housing and inner-city development,” he said. Stone is said to have been particularly proud of the LDA’s first big housing development, a project of 600 social and affordable homes on State land at Shanganagh, south of Shankill, providing much needed homes for the south Dublin and north Wicklow area. One colleague, speaking before Stone’s resignation, expressed concern at his potential departure from the LDA and the loss of “a genuine expert who has a deep understanding of how projects all fit together.” “What I would be concerned about is that he would just disappear into the background,” said the source who puts his help in Donohoe election postering down to his willingness to help a friend and politician he respected. “I am sure it never cost him a thought, throwing up a few posters.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Minister of State of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Pippa Hackett welcomed the significant progress highlighted in the Organic Strategy Forum report published today. The Report summarised the activities of the Forum in its first year of operation and was presented to the Minister by the Forum Chair, Mr. Padraig Brennan. The Forum was established by the Minister to bring together all relevant stakeholders in the Organic sector to drive forward the development of the sector and tackle barriers to its future growth. The Forum comprises representatives from relevant State Agencies, farm bodies, organic food processors and organic certification bodies. Minister Hackett stated “The Organic Strategy Forum has played a key role in identifying practical solutions to some of the barriers to the growth of the sector. I commend the work of the Chair, Padraig Brennan and the stakeholders for their work in identifying both issues and solutions to allow us to build on the experienced and dedicated cohort of organic farmers and processors we have here in Ireland. One of the priorities of the forum was to increase the critical mass of the organic sector and this was reflected in the record number of 2,100 new applications in Autumn 2022 to join the Organic Farming Scheme. We will drive on with this now and reopen the scheme again before the end of 2023”. “Development of new market opportunities for our increasing organic output is a clear priority for all of us this year. This will be a key focus of minein 2023, including leading a trade mission with Irish companies to the world’s largest organic trade fair, Biofach in Germany, next month”. The priorities for the Organic Strategy Forum in 2023 are highlighted in the progress report and reiterate the requirement to further increase participation in organic farming over the coming years to capitalise on the significant uptake recorded in 2022. Equally important priorities include: The co-ordination of organic supplies and reducing leakageDeveloping the market for Irish organic foodGreen procurementEducationInfrastructure and the capturing of accurate organic production data Chair of the Organic Strategy Forum, Padraig Brennan, concluded: “I would like to thank Minister Hackett for her strong support for the Organic Strategy Forum. The support and constructive engagement of the Forum members and their strong advocacy for organic farmers, producers and consumers ensures that we are well positioned to anticipate and proactively respond to the challenges and opportunities facing the organic food sector. Given the rapidly evolving marketplace and the ever-increasing focus on the environment, the expertise and experience of Forum members will be decisive in maintaining an upward growth in the value of the organic food sector. I look forward to working in partnership with the Department and the Forum members to ensure that the growth potential of this increasingly important sector is fully realised.” END Note for Editors: The Organic Strategy Forum progress report is available at the following link',\n",

To help answer your question, I feel we should look back a little at the source of these inflationary issues before we gaze into the crystal ball for the future. Before Covid (remember that?) we experienced a very long (almost zero) inflationary period when labour and material prices increased, but unless it was over a sustained period of time, it didn't have a huge impact on your project cost. In most cases, it would make little or no difference to the cost of your project throughout its duration. Then, in 2020, we had the first Covid lockdown (which lasted about six months) followed eventually by the reopening of the economy and construction sector. There was a sudden burst of energy where we began to build houses, commercial buildings, factories and infrastructure once again. There was not any significant inflation or lack of materials at the beginning of this reopening, but why was that? From what I have learned, if you remember way back then, we had been making provisions for the chaos Brexit might bring. As a result, we had significant stockpiles of most materials in place to smooth out the inevitable supply chain friction. In truth, Brexit was dwarfed by Covid, but these stockpiles facilitated a reasonably smooth exit from the first lockdown and let's face it, nobody really noticed or spoke of any difficulties. Fast forward to the following series of lockdowns and reopenings, we had no more stockpiles so when factories, transport and warehousing was mothballed, the real problems started. I remember getting a phone call from a manager of a building supplier who told me that there would be very significant delays and material price hikes ahead for even the most basic of building materials. We experienced this issue for some time but like most issues, the market reacts and gets to grips with the issue. Then, about this time last year, I spoke to the same building supplier manager, who told me that he expected things to start levelling and likely improve as 2022 wore on. Cue the beginning of the war in Ukraine a month later. Now, all bets are off. We have seamlessly transitioned from Brexit stockpiles to Covid related supply chain issues to an energy crisis with Russia controlling much of the world's gas, who knew? All of a sudden, while supply timelines were reasonable, prices soured again, particularly for materials whose productions are energy intensive. So, now it's that time of year again. I have been getting soundings from said building supplier company that they are cautiously optimistic. Some elements, for example, rough timber and steel (which were some of the first materials to rise) have in fact dropped a little, many elements are more or less level, and there are a few elements which are still rising, particularly plastering & quarried products (concrete blocks, aggregates, cement). So, has the market absorbed the full ramifications of the war in Ukraine? Maybe to date but who knows what way this war may twist and turn this year. We all hope it will come to an end soon but no one knows. Most builders are not taking inflation risk as they cannot measure it so the consumer (you) is having to carry it. Will prices come back down? My sense is that when there are significant reductions in input costs, these will be passed on as there will be pressure on the construction industry to do so given the fact that interest rates are rising at present. When and by how much will things improve, I don't know, but I am certainly looking ahead with cautious optimism this year, that is unless something new arrives on the horizon.

       "  'title': 'Irish investment consortium in €6.5m deal for landmark Donnybrook Mall',\n",
       "  'text': 'A consortium of private investors based in the west of Ireland has paid about €6.5 million for the landmark Donnybrook Mall in Dublin 4. Acquired by developer Sean Dunne for €17 million at the height of the last boom, the mall last changed hands in 2014, with its outgoing owner, an individual private Irish investor, paying €6.6 million to secure ownership of the 1,448sq m (15,590sq ft) property. On this occasion the scheme was offered to the market by agent Lisney last September at a guide price of €6.8 million. The buyers are believed to have secured the property in the face of competition from a number of parties. The mall’s new owners will have the benefit of immediate rental income of €450,343 annually from a strong tenant line-up which includes Tesco, Lloyds Pharmacy, the well-known dry cleaners Lyknu, Abrakebabra, and the long-established bridalwear boutique Marian Gale. The complex’s development potential is borne out by its positive planning history with one of Sean Dunne’s companies, Padholme, securing permission from Dublin City Council in 2008 for a three-storey over-basement mixed-use development of 3,455sq m (37,189sq ft) comprising six retail units, two office units, one restaurant/takeaway, one bank unit and four two-bedroom apartments as well as 15 car spaces. The permission was subsequently extended in 2014 to 2019. Donnybrook has seen significant residential development over recent years, with much of this aimed towards the upper end of Dublin’s private rented sector (PRS) market. Richmond Homes is currently at an advanced stage of building 139 apartments at Eglington Place on the corner of Eglington Road and Donnybrook Road, while Keith Craddock’s Red Rock Donnybrook Ltd obtained planning permission for a 10-storey 84-apartment build-to-rent scheme on the Circle K petrol station site opposite Bective Rangers’ rugby grounds. Developer Shane Whelan’s Westridge Real Estate, meanwhile, is developing a 91-unit co-living scheme across seven storeys on the site of the former Kiely’s public house. At Donnybrook Crescent construction is under way of Lovett House which is an eight-storey mixed-used development containing 49 build-to-rent apartments.',\n",

       "  'text': 'With demand falling, the amount of \"grey space,\" in Cork, defined as spare office accommodation that remains dormant despite being leased, is also likely to rise further in the new year, with many occupiers considering subletting surplus office space that they no longer need. The trend comes amid a surge in job cuts across Ireland\\'s tech sector, along with working from home and global uncertainty causing a major shift in post-pandemic work practices. Research published last year showed that 78% of employees wanted to stay working from home, and as energy prices continue to put a strain on office expenses, many companies have facilitated this by enabling more flexible working conditions. Despite already significant vacancy rates, estate agent, Lisney Sothebys has warned that Cork is 12 months behind Dublin, where grey space already accounts for a third of the capital\\'s commercial property. The agency has warned that commerical vacancy rates could increase even further in Cork, leading to a reduction in headline rents, with the report finding that even if they remain unchanged, landlords will need to offer greater incentive packages to influence demand. While the supply of commercial property remains bouyant, residential accommodation in Cork is still heavily undersupplied, with the agency saying that it remains so despite a 62% increase in 2022. Furthermore, the construction of new homes also started to fall back in the second half of last year following a surge in construction costs and funding needs, with Lisney Sotheby\\'s warning that this will continue to be an issue this year, further impacting supply which will be particularly difficult for first time buyers. While forecasts for the upper-end of the residential market remain strong, the agency has warned that the mid and entry level parts will continue to experience affordability issues to a greater extent as mortgage rates increase and disposable income levels fall.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Loan approvals at Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), the Government agency charged with funding the delivery of new homes, have increased by 49 per cent, new data has shown. The agency said total loan approvals at the end of 2022 amounted to just under €1.25 billion, up from a total of €835 million at the end of 2021. Almost three-quarters of that figure has already been drawn down, at €909 million for 60 developments, with 4,132 units under construction or completed. That means around €413 million was approved for new housing projects over the course of last year. But the figures also showed a slowdown in the rate of new approvals in the latter half of 2022. Between January and June, some €325 million in loan approvals were logged, with that figure dropping to €88 million in the second half of the year. “The first half of 2022 was our busiest ever six-month period in terms of loan approvals and, while we saw a lower level of applications and new approvals in the second half reflecting a slowdown in construction activity across the market, feedback from housebuilders indicates that demand for new funding is resilient despite the challenges of construction price inflation and higher interest rates,” said HBFI chief executive Dara Deering. HBFI has approved funding for more than 5,700 new homes in 99 developments, spread across 21 counties. Around a quarter of those home are social housing, with 50 per cent for owner occupiers, 20 per cent for renters and 5 per cent for Part V, which stipulates developers must set aside a portion of their developments for social housing. More than 1,200 HBFI-funded units have already been sold, and a further 1,800 were contracted for sale or sale agreed at the end of 2022. The majority of the homes – 70 per cent – funded by HBFI are two- or three-bed units aimed at the first-time buyer market. The average overall facility size has remained around €13 million, with individual loan facilities ranging from €1 million to €94 million. “Through its broad product range, and agile business model, HBFI plays a key role in the Government’s strategy to meet the targets set out under Housing for All. Today’s update highlights the strong performance by HBFI over the last six months,” said the Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath. “With viability remaining challenging for the construction sector, I welcome HBFI’s commitment to work with customers and stakeholders to support a continued increase in housing supply in the market. I am confident HBFI will continue to work to monitor the risks and opportunities for future funding.” HBFI was established by the Government in late 2018 to address a shortfall in finance available for the construction of residential housing by providing finance at market rates to commercially viable developments.',\n",

       "  'title': 'New rules on collective bargaining could transform union landscape, says Ictu general secretary Owen Reidy',\n",
       "  'text': 'Proposed changes to the rules of engagement between employers and trade unions could give more workers meaningful representation in their workplaces, Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) general secretary Owen Reidy says. Appointed late last year to succeed Patricia King as general secretary, 50-year-old Reidy from Donegal describes the Minimum Wage Directive and its promotion of the increased collective bargaining coverage clause as “probably the most progressive thing from a workers’ rights point of view that’s come out of the European Union in the last two decades”. In addition, the anticipated implementation of the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) High-Level Working Group on Collective Bargaining is set to require companies to engage with unions in “good faith”. Combined, the two measures could mark a major turning point for unions that have been battling hard for quite some time to maintain membership numbers even as the nation’s workforce expanded dramatically. [ Why has Isme been left out of collective bargaining forum? ] “There’s a lot in the directive,” Reidy says. “In a nutshell, it will oblige the government to seek to promote collective bargaining between unions and employers, negotiating on pay both locally and at sectoral level. Collective bargaining coverage in Ireland is about 34 per cent, that’s including public service. Union density (membership levels) among all workers is about 27 or 28 per cent. “So there are some people who aren’t in unions but get the benefit of an agreement. But the commission is basically saying we need to see collective bargaining coverage around 80 per cent which would be doubling it in Ireland.” This, he suggests, is partly down to European leaders reacting to the rise of the sort of populism that yielded Brexit and far-right election successes in a number of countries. “The current commission is led by Ursula von der Leyen who is from the centre right but it has made it clear that work must pay because they want the centre to hold. We, as part of the European Trade Union movement, said ‘well, the best way for work to pay is through collective bargaining, not necessarily through minimum wages; it’s through facilitating unions and employers to negotiate’.” The LEEF High Level Group, which included union leaders, academics, senior figures from the Irish Business and Employers’ Confederation (Ibec) and the construction industry and Government officials, delivered a report in October that sets out the grounds on which collective bargaining can be reformed in Ireland. Included in the report was a provision that firms be obliged to engage in “good faith” with unions. If the employers fail to do so, even where unions are representing relatively small numbers of their workers, they can ultimately end up before the courts. One senior Siptu official says that would “save the union movement” as many private sector employers who currently decline to engage could be obliged to. That would potentially make union membership far more appealing in sectors like the traditional powerhouse of manufacturing where it is now running at 13 per cent according to a report by the Geary Institute at UCD. In hospitality, with its many low-paid jobs, it was found to be close to half that. In his previous role as minister for enterprise, Leo Varadkar suggested the provisions could become law this year, although the department’s briefing document for his successor, Simon Coveney, suggests 2024 may be more likely. Reidy credits the now Taoiseach with some progressive legislation while at the department but says there may be “forces” there who are less than enthusiastic about any substantial changes to the labour relations landscape. Given the stakes, he suggests, the unions may have to fight their corner although he believes there is an understanding on the employers’ side that many of the proposed changes can help to provide long-term stability. “I do think, you know, in the 21st century, it makes sense to kind of share power, it makes sense to operate collectively across Europe in a multilateral world, and it makes sense to try and improve workers voice in the labour market,” he says before suggesting Ibec’s Danny McCoy may largely agree. While LEEF’s work to date has been important, he says, “we would like, like Ibec, a much more deeper, more meaningful involvement”. [ Fintan O’Toole: Want to change the world? Join a union ] Reidy understands, he says, the lingering discomfort in some quarters with aspects of partnership but argues that Government, by improving things like public transport, delivering better healthcare and providing increased support in areas like childcare, can help maintain or improve living standards without workers having to rely entirely on wage increases. This, he believes, is a large part of the pay off for companies who, he contends, must pay for the bulk of the additional public expenditure envisaged through increased taxes. Beyond that he insists the Ictu and its affiliates are in a decent position to build off the back of the changes with issues like pay and remote working providing a strong basis for connecting with members new and old. [ New Ictu general secretary Owen Reidy targets recruitment of young members as priority ] “The legislation isn’t going to organise any workers,” he says, “but I do think with a fair wind it’ll facilitate and create the capacity for unions to up their game when it comes to organising more workers.” Not everything in that UCD report, Union Voice in Ireland, would provide encouragement but Reidy refers more than once to a finding that 66 per cent of young workers in non-union environments say they would like to join a union. “It’s exciting,” he says, at the prospect of all that young union blood. It must be. It will certainly have been a while coming.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Over 28,700 units of large developments are awaiting An Bord Pleanála permission',\n",
       "  'text': 'A TOTAL of 28,786 units in housing and apartment developments are awaiting a planning permission decision from An Bord Pleanála, new analysis has found. The annual constructor sector report from consultants Mitchell McDermott found that 59% of Strategic Housing Developments (SHDs) applications before An Bord Plenála last year did not receive a decision. The SHD system was designed as a fast-track planning process for schemes of 100 apartments or houses. The analysis found that the Bord granted permission for just 26% of applications, or almost 13,000 units. “Everyone knows the Bord has had its issues this year but to have so many units deplayed amid a housing crisis is unacceptable,” Paul Mitchell, one of the authors of the report, said. “You would imagine this backlog could easily be addressed by drafting in additional resources from private practice here or from the UK and we believe this should be done straight away,” he said. There was a 79% drop in the number of judicial reviews taken against SHDs last year. Mitchell said the firm found the reduction was due in large measure to the large drop in the number of decisions being made by An Board Pleanála on SHDs. The report found that a total of 31,125 units in SHDs which received planning permission have been subjected to judicial reviews over the past five years. “Just 10% or so have gone ahead, 10,727 units were quashed, while 17,805 are still awaiting a decision from the courts – a total of 28,532,” Mitchell said. A second of the report focused on tracking the number of SHDs which received planning permission between 2018 and 2022 but have not yet commenced. It found that of the 103,057 SHD units which received planning permission during this period, 28,755 (28%) have not yet commenced. Construction costs The report also found that the construction costs of a two-bed mid-range apartment increased by 9.6% or between €21,000 to €25,000 last year. The hard costs of building a two-bed, medium rise suburban apartment is now over €240,000, it found. The main contributors to the increase are mechanical and electrical services, up 18%, concrete, up 27%, brickwork, up 39%, and reinforcement steel, up 17%. The €240,000 figure excludes indirect costs, parking, siteworks, margin and VAT. If those are included the total cost of delivering the apartment is in the region of €460,000; the sales price would have to equal or exceed this.',\n",

       "  'title': \"The political Unionist cake is not growing. Only who wins the bigger slice alters. – Slugger O'Toole\",\n",
       "  'text': 'A publication for Church leaders recently headlined ‘the rise of the ‘dones’; a growing number of people who are ‘done with the Church.’ They have not abandoned their faith but have ‘de-churched.’ Attendance figures bear this out. One interviewee commented: ’they have heard it all and are tired of the same routine; being lectured to without any meaningful engagement or participation.’ Church scandals have played their part. The situation resonates with Northern Ireland as political parties exhibit a ‘this is the way mentality’; that without tight control and direction, everything will fall apart and decision-making will lose focus; But this sort of detached leadership is becoming less attractive. Bored with politics and politicians that convert every issue and political discourse into an arena for conflict and narrow political allegiances, a growing proportion of the population is not merely rejecting historical religious labelling and identities but their closely associated political affiliations. Polling and university research on prevailing demographics show consistent growth in the middle ground with the mainline parties, nationalist-republican and unionist, left to engage in internecine electoral battles to win the biggest share of their chosen but steadily reducing constituencies. The political Unionist cake is not growing. Only who wins the greater slice alters. Within unionism, many continue to support the maintenance of the Union however it is not just millennials and those who voted to remain in the EU who comprise a sizeable proportion, increasingly de-motivated and feeling unrepresented; disenfranchised by the limited ambition and accountability of political Unionism. An expedient unanimity of shared but tenuous, – if recent UUP spokespersons are to be believed – and divergent unease with and antipathy, across broad unionism, towards the Ireland/Northern Ireland protocol, cannot mask what is hidden in plain sight. Unease with the protocol, genuine as it may be, does not equate to support or approval for past and present decision-making by political unionism. With its traits of being intolerant, legalistic and irrelevant to the lived experiences of many, a growing constituency of individuals are ‘done’ with it and want a shift of focus. Where creative thinking is an imperative, unionists are offered robotic compliance by representatives entrenched in a culture of small mindedness; only comfortable in a culture bunker. This getting the meaning of the Union muddled with abstractions. There is much evidence. For the many who are placed on long waiting lists for healthcare if they are lucky, it is small comfort that as they suffer pain and maybe die, they do so under the Union flag. If is this what the Union means, the many tattered flags which adorn lamp-posts offer a stark symbolism. Too often unionist politics, pre-and post the Good Friday Agreement, are characterised by a failure to move beyond damage limitation and a lingering sense of ‘what has been given up’ crisis management. When immediate pressure is relieved, a sense of false certainty results and unionism reverts back to old behaviour; lack of transparency, failed leadership models, limited sense of mission and exclusivity. Capacity is not built to shape a long-term commitment to re-culturing and renewal; to build on growing success in key areas of the economy, education and culture to make Northern Ireland work for all; not seek to revert to ‘ ruling the roost.’ Rigidity in ideology and delusional claims to building reconciliation serve only to emphasise how unionism has facilitated the ugly scaffolding of the Good Friday Agreement to produce the ugly politics which have stalled or diverted the process inherent within the 1998 Agreement. This runs counter to the rationale for the scaffolding and is out of kilter with many pro-Union individuals and groups who do not work this way in their lives or communal and societal settings. Different civic organisations are gaining attention in numerous disciplines and sectors as vehicles for community building, promoting wellbeing and social change. Participatory actions and discourse challenge marginalisation and socio-political exclusion. This is the opposite of regulated political unionism which, frozen in an orthodoxy dating from the establishment of Northern Ireland, remains uncomfortable with disruption and challenge, internal and external. Such is also evident, not least in unionism’s willingness to operate and tinker at the edge of the Good Friday Agreement with little involvement or interest in North-South Bodies. It may yet fall off the edge. In 1998, Unionist and Nationalist-Republican parties, with others, were given the opportunity to emerge from prolonged conflict; to govern within a devolved continuum which did not shut out or call for the abandonment of long held constitutional preferences. The challenge to each of the designated MLAs, not least within the largest parties, was to persuade a majority of the community to endorse their platform for change, or not; whilst adhering to a popular mandate to implement the three strands of the Good Friday Agreement to the benefit of all. What has resulted is a fixed pattern of attrition, antagonistic populism and financial impropriety. This is a choice of the parties who populate the structures. The co-guarantors in London and Dublin are not without responsibility in indulging the political eco-system that pertains. Cobbled together lifeboat measures like A Fresh Start and New Decade, New Approach have not delivered promised outcomes or clear direction. Many pro-union voters have arrived at a point where they will no longer condone the complicity of political unionism in this power dynamic that staggers between ineffectiveness and posturing; crisis and erratic duration. Results do not equate to the resources made available whilst the main parties remain wedded to traditional platforms as a camouflage for self-interest, tribal power and privilege. Sometimes also to the benefit of relatives and family members who find employment funded by generous expenses. For anyone wishing to promote the Union, this is a deficit strategy destined to deliver long-term failure; a structural and electoral blind spot, preferring safeguards to growth. Unionism, like many groups and individuals, needs to move beyond its traditional binary interpretation and promotion of the Union by abandoning its PUL branding and creaking back of a lorry rhetoric. It needs to expand its scope and incorporate inclusivity into its analyses and networks; become more aspirational for the whole community. Build consensus by reducing space between people and move finally from tactics based on demographic dominance. As the Union is de-constructed and re-imagined at Westminster an alternative form of politically inclusive and consensual unionism is an imperative. It needs to draw on and make itself relevant to the lives of diverse sectors and groups which define the community. On recent performance, it is a big ask for Unionist political representatives in parties which seem to value the past more than a better future. Led by leaders and favoured cadres who promote blind loyalty, with silence used to monopolise power, there is limited evidence of any creative critique or strategic discourse. Yet, the time is opportune to embrace and coalesce around peace, justice, equality, inclusion, humanity and well-being. However, discouraged from thinking for themselves, representatives lend their minds to the leadership. This surely must produce a system of under-used assets and ignorance which filters into policies and practice; some views paramount whilst others are summarily dismissed. Resulting distortion by a dominant and rigid ideology underpinned by normative values is a long-standing trait of political unionism ensues. It is being eroded. Women, LBGTQ, diverse ethnic communities, younger people, socially liberal and marginalised people who reflect the historic hidden experience of unionism now conclude and demonstrate that a top-down framework is not conducive to building vital consensus around social, economic, health, housing, cultural and education issues; addressing wasteful segregation and lasting reconciliation to make Northern Ireland for all. Political Unionism needs to move beyond honeyed and condescending rhetoric when addressing non-aligned unionism and the community; grasp the possibilities; recognise and embrace the dynamic desire for a more pluralist and inclusive place, beyond narrow designations and identities. The longer this takes, the greater will be the growth in those muted conversations which are taking place as to how Northern Ireland needs to work better for all. There will be a cruel irony if the Union, currently on offer from those who value it most whilst going out of their way to distort its core purposes, acts as the author of its own demise. Will those who are ‘ done’ with political Unionism come to a point were they are done with this Union? It is not inconceivable that out of the continuing division and rigidity, a new mutuality will grow.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Home sales volumes down as prices jump 9.7%',\n",
       "  'text': 'The number of homes sold in the final three months of 2022 was more than 7 per cent lower than in the same period of 2021, with an almost 10 per cent jump in sales prices in the year, analysis of the Property Price Register (PPR) has indicated. Some 16,881 residential units, both new and existing, were sold in the fourth quarter of last year, 3,332 of which were new homes, according to a report from property tech start-up Geowox. This represents a 7.4 per cent decline in overall sales from the fourth quarter of 2021, when some 18,225 units changed hands. The figures are based on sales data rather than asking prices, with the reporting of a sale to the PPR often lagging behind the transaction itself. But despite the apparent drop in volumes, house prices climbed 9.7 per cent across the State between October and the end of December last year, with the median price of a home increasing by €27,000 over the 12-month period to €304,000, according to the data. On a county-by-county basis, Dublin had the highest volume of sales in the last quarter at 4,763, representing 28.2 per cent of the total, Geowox’s analysis showed. Dublin, where the median price of a property sold in the final three months of 2022 was €420,000, also remained the most expensive county in Ireland. Dublin and its commuter counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow were the only counties where prices were above the Statewide median. The data for the Republic as a whole indicates that property price inflation, which cooled throughout the year amid rising borrowing costs and cost-of-living pressures, remained relatively stable in the second half of 2022. The annual rate of increase was 9.5 per cent in the year to the end of September 2022, according to Geowox’s last report, compared with a 14 per cent increase in the 12 months to the end of June. The figures broadly tally with Central Statistics Office data, published last week, which indicated that the cost of a home rose 8.6 per cent in the 12 months to the end of November, down from a 9.7 per cent increase in the year to October. The property industry here is still predicting positive growth in prices in 2023. Gareth McKeown, head of valuations at Geowox, said the resilience of the Irish housing market was “set to be tested” further this year. “Price growth may well be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times’ income,” he said. “Worrying trends” had also been observed in the construction sector, Mr McKeown said, with recent data indicating a slowdown in the rate of output. While it is clear that house price growth continued to cool in the fourth quarter, he said: “It remains to be seen how much of this is seasonal, and how much is fundamental. This will become clearer in the busy spring selling season.”',\n",

       "  'title': '‘All he did was put up those bleeding posters’ - Dublin inner city laments departure of Michael Stone',\n",
       "  'text': 'Paddy Murdiff, a long-time community activist in Dublin’s north inner city, lists off the projects that businessman Michael Stone oversaw during his five years chairing a State-backed board. “Mick Stone is probably the best person to happen to this community. He was very effective. It is a big loss for us,” said Murdiff of the businessman’s work in the inner city. Others connected with Dublin North East Inner City (NEIC) programme and have knowledge of Stone’s chairmanship of the implementation board agree, even after his resignation this week. The founder of multinational engineering business, The Designer Group, resigned from the NEIC implementation board and the board of the Land Development Agency (LDA). He did so after admitting to inadvertently misleading Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe over undisclosed help he gave putting up election posters for the 2020 general election. “Mick didn’t waste time. He was there to get a job done and everything he did was for the interest of the area,” said another local activist. “I deal with people all the time who talk about philanthropy. He put his time where his mouth was.” [ Profile: Michael Stone, the private man behind the public headlines ] For Murdiff, the one that stands out was the renovation of Lourdes Day Care Centre on Sean McDermott Street which provides a place for older people to meet and enjoy a hot meal. It was one of the first places that Stone visited after he became chairman of the implementation board set up in 2016 at the initiative of the then taoiseach Enda Kenny. The then Fine Gael leader had attended the funeral of a local man mistakenly murdered during a gangland feud and was profoundly affected by the tragic scenes he witnessed after the killing. The inner city regeneration effort worked over recent years because of Stone’s drive, the backing of Donohoe, a TD for the area and a Government Minister, and Martin Fraser, who was, until last year, the State’s top civil servant. Since 2016, the Government has invested more than €38 million through the NEIC to improve the lives of people living and working in the district. In Government circles, Stone is remembered for breaking down barriers to get things done. “Most of the things that you will see in the NEIC annual reports are down to Mick. He was the main fellah driving this. It wouldn’t have happened without him,” said one source. In the controversy over Donohoe’s election posters, Stone is said to be “bewildered” with all the media attention. He has been the biggest casualty of the affair, one lamented by those who worked closely with him. As they view it, he was a successful experienced businessman giving time freely and free of charge to two important State agencies tackling two huge problems in Irish society: poverty and housing. His resignation from the boards have left some concerned at the “chill effect” this might have on others, discouraging successful, private individuals from volunteering in public service. “If we had a few more Michael Stones who came out and gave back to their areas, I would be delighted,” said Fine Gael TD Michael Ring, a former minister for community development. “We need business people getting involved in politics, in social life, in disadvantaged areas. We need their advice and their expertise, and you need a different voice than civil servants. We need business people in this country to create jobs. Business is not a bad word,” he said. At the LDA, people valued Stone’s considerable experience in the area of engineering and construction when it came to the agency’s big housing projects. “He was providing an insight into the construction industry that very few people who serve on boards are willing or able to do,” said one source. The source said that on occasions when the LDA was engaging construction companies, Stone absented his company from the procurement process to avoid any appearance of impropriety. “He is very scrupulous about avoiding any conflict of interest,” said the source. I think he [Michael Stone] was one in a million. He did what he had to do and he was genuinely for the area, and that was the big part of it— Paddy Murdiff, community activist A senior Government official expressed concern that prominent people in the private sector “would run a mile” from high-profile public service roles in light of what has happened to Stone. “This is yet another example of a big witch-hunt around something about nothing,” he said. “It is becoming very dangerous to provide a public service to the best of your ability, even for free. It is a profound public policy problem. There seems to be nothing between zero and public crucifixion,” said the source. [ What does Michael Stone’s apology mean for Paschal Donohoe? ] The NEIC initiative was considered a successful template with talk of it being applied in other deprived parts of Dublin city. The resignation of Stone and the departure of Fraser to the Irish Ambassador’s job in London is viewed as an impediment to the future of the project. “It is very sad and kind of tragic for that area. It is going to be hard to replicate that,” said one former Government official who had first-hand knowledge of how the NEIC worked. Local community activist Murdiff is unsure of who they might find to replace Stone. “It will be detrimental to the area unless they get somebody like him. I think he was one in a million. He did what he had to do and he was genuinely for the area, and that was the big part of it,” he said. To those in working in the inner city, the cost of Stone’s departure to the initiative he chaired far outweighs the mistakes that led to his resignation this week. “All he did was put up those bleeding posters,” said Murdiff.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Many teachers like this one, a male primary teacher working in Limerick, don’t want to go on the record about their own students but many, even at primary level, report hearing about Tate from their students. “I mostly hear students mocking him,” says another teacher in an all-boys secondary, “but I’ve come across the odd boy, often a quiet student, who has been influenced.” Another teacher in a rural mixed school says: “I’ve never heard anything about him directly, but I got a response to a question about a novel that made me suspect that a student had been watching his videos.” Tate’s arrest on charges of rape and human trafficking in Romania was the first time many Irish adults had heard of him, but younger people here are reportedly well-acquainted with the champion kickboxer, entrepreneur, and anti-‘woke’ influencer. In July 2022, he was the most Googled name on the planet and in the virtual world of Tiktok, he is a well-established celebrity, where videos of him have been watched 11.6bn times. Tate describes hitting and choking women online, referring to them as “chicks”, “bitches”, and “hoes”. He has argued that rape victims must “bear responsibility” for their attacks in a clip watched over 2.5m times. The American-born, British citizen fled England in 2017 in the wake of numerous accusations of sexual assault by women there. His move to Romania was a calculated one. “I’m not a rapist… I like the idea of a man being free. In the West any woman can destroy a man for life… In Eastern Europe none of this stuff flies.” He is currently in detention in Romania, suspected of having recruited victims for a criminal online porn scam. Female teachers say some male students use Andrew Tate to intimidate them in the classroom. Students allegedly add the tag “make me a sandwich” to the end of their work, thereby announcing themselves as followers of the influencer. One young female teacher working in Dublin says: “I have one student in particular who idolises Tate. He brings him up all the time in class, to get a rise out of me, and it’s intimidating in an all-boys school. “I spoke to my boyfriend’s younger brother, who I can chat to on a different level, and he said that Tate is a genius because he says what everyone is afraid to say. “It’s terrifying that Andrew Tate is having this effect on the next generation. It’s happening and it’s not being stopped. “There are newspaper articles, but they’re not being discussed. Any 13-year-old boy in Ireland knows Andrew Tate. That’s a real problem.” Dismissing education Tate does his best to appear legitimate online. His “university”, in its third iteration, now called “Hustler University 3.0” announces itself as “a worldwide community of over 160,000+ active members learning from a select network of experts in freelancing, crypto, investing, and business”. For a $50 monthly membership fee people are offered an opportunity to match the extreme wealth and success of Tate, who claims to be “the smartest person on the fucking planet”. The Guardian reports that members, some as young as 13, are promised £10,000 a month by learning about crypto investing, drop shipping, and persuading other people to join. Tate’s approach is thoroughly and proudly anti-establishment and throughout his online narrative he actively dismisses mainstream education, which, he says, is left-leaning and “woke”. “We grow stronger every day,” he says of his online university, “while traditional education becomes less and less relevant.” Tate argues that men or boys should take control of women and become rich and successful. He presents the West as an emasculating culture in decline. He is clear and specific in his world view explaining to his millions of followers: “Women should clean up. Not only should women clean up, women should clean up unprompted… I pay for things unprompted… my card always works.” Feeding on boys' fears “Ask any class if they have heard of Tate and the majority will have done so,” says civics teacher Edwin Magnier, who works in a mixed Cork secondary school. He is is happy to go on the record to stem Tate’s influence over other young people in Ireland. “My awareness of this kind of threat began with the emergence of the alt-right movement. Boys are often targeted and radicalised online. “I’ve been concerned about it for the last five years and have been actively designing lessons to counteract the world view being taught to our young men.” As Magnier explains, people like Tate attack young minds before they are educated, and often bad-mouthing mainstream educators is part of their ploy. “Anyone with an education will see through it; we need to be very aware of it in the last few years of primary, whenever a child is given access to the internet. “By secondary [level], in my experience, most students laugh at him. He’s a person to ridicule, often used as a meme. It’s the younger or more vulnerable students we need to protect.” Tate often includes sound advice in the midst of his hateful rhetoric, explains Magnier, reminding young people to work hard for success for instance. He presents himself as a mentor and if a child lacks an actual mentor in their life, it can be both powerful and persuasive. “He delegitimises any other adults who might influence their minds in a positive way, like teachers. “This is a man with 17 expensive cars; he is uber rich and so young people see him as successful. His message to them is that you can be successful too if you overcome your ‘wokeness’. He argues that women are suffering in our culture too because they want to be dominated.” A 14-year-old girl brought Tate to Magnier’s attention after boys started to repeat his ideas in school. “His message to young men is that women are property,” says Magnier. “He tells boys and men to convince girls and women in their lives of that too — in order to manipulate them. He feeds on boys’ fears around masculinity and changing gender roles and links it back to his own wealth. “He describes himself as a powerful alpha male who dominates women. He warns his followers against being weak beta males who tend to be unsuccessful. “He tells them their meekness and inability to stand up to women will mean that women will dominate and destroy them. “The man is being accused of rape and human trafficking. He manipulates women to make money and is open about that. He is not a role model.” Ireland’s shortcomings when it comes to sex education are well documented. Spunout, Ireland’s youth information website created by young people, for young people, is concerned about the paucity of relationship education in schools. “The main source of our sex ed comes from social, personal and health education (SPHE). The current system donates just one hour per week to this subject. This is simply too little. “Sex ed is something that is very important for children, particularly in the junior cycle. “They are at an age when they are entering early puberty and without proper education on the subject of sex it can be a confusing time.” Psychotherapist and author Richard Hogan believes education on Tate needs to start at home. “We must talk to our children about his views; we must help children to think their way through his destructive and negative ideas about women and men’s role in society. Parents must help dismantle these views.” Students reportedly tell their teachers that they are fearful of sharing their online experiences with parents. They worry that their parents might curtail their usage in future. “No way would I show my mum what’s coming up on my screen,” one teacher reports hearing from a 12-year-old boy. “She’d take it off me!” In the UK, where Tate is perhaps best known, the education sector is proactive in its approach. Teachers report the serious “hold” he has on students, as is beginning to happen here. Some schools are running whole-school assemblies entirely devoted to Tate and his ideology. Men At Work CIC trains professionals who work with boys and young men to facilitate constructive dialogues with them about being safe. They have visited dozens of schools to date. They specifically address the reality of young boys being groomed and radicalised by people like Tate. Here, Justice Minister Simon Harris had admitted feeling worried about the influence of Tate on boys. “I think it shows what happens when the State doesn’t step up to its responsibilities. I don’t just mean this State, I mean in general… We need to be much better at providing age-appropriate information around sex education, around gender equality, and through the school curriculum.” Harris goes on to mention a “zero-tolerance strategy” in the pipeline for Irish schools. Other commentators argue that Tiktok needs to do far more to protect young users by ensuring all content on the platform is devoid of hateful, harmful messaging.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Ireland’s housing crisis: why doesn’t the State step in and build?',\n",
       "  'text': 'It’s perhaps the most frequently asked question of Ireland’s housing crisis. Why doesn’t the State step in and build? Whether the chronic undersupply or the lack of affordability meet the definition of market failure is immaterial, housing is now a block on the State’s future development. Perhaps the most galling aspect is that we don’t lack the means to address it. The exchequer is awash with tax receipts and there is an abundance of State land, either idle or underused, to be built on. In such circumstances, the Government’s overwhelming reliance on the private sector to deliver housing is difficult to weigh up particularly when the political fallout has been so severe. Some argue that the Government is ideologically wedded to the idea that the market is the most efficient model for dealing with the State’s housing needs and by extension opposed to the type of large-scale social housing projects we’ve had in the past. This neoliberal tendency can be seen in the shift away from building social homes directly in favour of providing rent supports – the so-called shift from bricks to benefits. And by the fact that the social housing which is provided comes – almost entirely – from the private sector. Of the 2,706 new-build social homes delivered up to the end of September last year, 72 per cent were acquired by way of so-called turnkey purchases – where the local authority or approved housing body (AHB) enters into a forward-purchasing arrangement with a private developer – or through the Part V rule, which stipulates developers must set aside a certain portion of their developments for social housing. [ The Irish Times view on the housing crisis ] Others argue that because the majority of voters here are homeowners who benefit from rising house prices, the Government is averse to a major intervention, which might depress prices and displace a significant chunk of private-sector activity. That seems unlikely, however, given the political heat the crisis is generating, And the days of governments benefiting from rising house prices are well gone. Policymakers may get it wrong but to suggest they’re harbouring hidden motives on housing seems overly conspiratorial. There is a simpler explanation, and one that seems to grow like a weed in Irish society: bureaucracy. For all the criticism laid at their door, local authorities here are so tied up in red tape and process when it comes to the provision of housing that purchasing units directly from the private sector has become a more efficient use of resources and time. More than Covid, more than higher construction costs, local councils link the undersupply of social housing to what’s known as the “four-stage process” – the heavily bureaucratic and massively time-consuming process that the Department of Housing and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform makes them go through when they want to build directly. To secure capital funding to build under the Department of Housing’s Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP), councils must first make the business case for the project before securing pre-planning approval. The first two phases are said to be relatively straightforward. However, it’s the next two stages where the problems start. Under the pre-tender design stage – stage three of the process – the local authority’s architects must engage with the Department of Housing’s architects to agree the final design, a back and forward process that can take months. [ More than 45,000 homes stuck in planning system despite housing crisis, consultants say ] When the final design is agreed, the councils, under the final cost-appraisal and procurement stage, must haggle with the department on what they think the tender price should be, mindful of various price caps set by the department, and rather weirdly before actually going out and procuring a builder to do the work. The price they agree with the department may not be the price they can secure in the marketplace. In a period of rapid cost price inflation, this process has become extremely difficult. The department also forces councils to adopt a new procurement process for each project rather than allowing keep a panel of prospective builders on tap through a framework agreement like in other sectors. If the proposed project is a mixed tenure development with affordable and disability-adapted units alongside standard social housing units, there are also different funding streams, each requiring their own four-stage process that must be navigated in parallel. All in, the pre-construction process is meant to take 52 weeks (with an additional one to two years for construction). In reality, it takes two or three years before a brick is even laid on the ground. Central government imposes these cost-control strictures. [ Government beats housing target but what difference does it make? ] But they are so rigorous that councils say they are effectively disincentivised to build, an irony given the lack of cost control we’ve seen with some of the bigger capital projects like the children’s hospital. Either way, a great public-sector housing build, something that is badly needed and something that could ease pressure right through the system, evades us. Last year’s social housing delivery target was meant to 9,000 units, it’s likely to be 6,500-7,500. In 1975, the then government, with a fraction of the financial resources of the current one, built 8,800 social homes, a record that is still to be eclipsed despite the severity of the current housing crisis.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Business group Ibec warns housing crisis is 'critical barrier to growth and business investment'\",\n",
       "  'text': 'BUSINESS GROUP IBEC has warned that the housing crisis is a critical barrier to continued growth and business investment. Ibec, a group that represents Irish businesses, has today launched a new housing report as part of its “Better Lives, Better Business” campaign. The group has called on the government to urgently deliver “a suite of ambitious policies to speed up the delivery of much-needed housing, and improve viability and affordability”. It has also issued some “key recommendations” which the group claims would “cut the cost of new home by €30,000”. ‘Challenge to business operations’ In a recent Ibec CEO survey, over 70% of companies identified housing availability for staff as a challenge to their business operations in the year ahead. However, 30% deemed this to be a “major challenge” while more than a quarter of businesses said the impact of housing availability on employees was one of the top three external priorities for their business. Ibec’s director of lobbying and influence Fergal O’Brien said: “An inadequate supply of affordable housing is the single largest impediment to attracting and retaining talented workers, without whom business investment and expansions are not possible.” He added: “The housing crisis has increasingly become a concern in relation to cohesion in the workplace and society more broadly. Younger workers, in particular, are financially pressed by ever-higher rents and the receding prospect of homeownership. “This ultimately spills over into issues around well-being and productivity in the workplace, while in the longer-term, if left unchecked, will also create emerging challenges in terms of pension adequacy and people’s broader stake in society over the coming decades.” O’Brien said that from “an employer perspective” there is a need to “reinvigorate the policy drive around the availability and affordability of housing”. He said this will include “reform of the planning and procurement system to speed delivery, a ramping up of ambition in affordable and cost-rental housing, and significant investment in skills and modern methods of construction”. O’Brien claimed that Ibec’s proposed fiscal measures would “reduce the cost of a typical €400,000 new home by €30,000 and this could be achieved with immediate effect”. ‘Key recommendations’ Some of Ibec’s key recommendations to address the housing crisis includes investment in Further Education to address skills shortages and “improved tax treatment of landlords’ expenses”. Ibec said “improved tax treatment of landlords’ expenses” could be achieved “while also ensuring greater security for tenants”. This would be done through “greater resourcing for local authorities and the Residential Tenancies Board to meet a 25% annual rental inspection target, a deposit protection scheme, and a national car testing equivalent scheme for the accommodation rental sector”. Ibec’s report also calls for local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to aim for the delivery of 20,000 social, cost-rental and affordable units annually by the end of the decade. The business group also included as a key recommendation the temporary introduction of a VAT refund order worth 5% of a new home for buyers of new build homes to offset rising costs of construction, as well as greater collaboration with manufacturers and the construction sector. Ibec is also seeking resources to recruit and retain staff to reduce planning backlogs and improve timeliness and to “significantly increase funding through the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) to ensure adequate development finance in the market”.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Credit Demand Survey April 2022 – September 2022  - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Department of Finance has today published the latest in its series on SME Credit Demand Surveys which covers the period April 2022– September 2022. This survey series is currently being conducted by Behaviour and Attitudes, on behalf of the Department of Finance. It is the most comprehensive survey of SME Credit Demand in Ireland, covering over 1,500 respondents through in-depth discussions. The survey captures a full picture of the SME landscape in Ireland, with micro-enterprises, small-sized enterprises and medium-sized enterprises accurately represented as per the percentage make-up of SMEs in Ireland. The survey is conducted biannually. Throughout the report, the most recent wave of findings (referred to as September 2022) is compared with corresponding waves. This ensures that historical comparisons are being made on a like-for-like basis, taking any seasonal issues into account. Key results include: The number of SMEs that applied for bank credit was 17%. A total of 5% of SMEs applied for non-bank finance.SMEs reported that sufficient internal funds was the reason for not seeking credit for 79% of firms.Of all businesses surveyed, 44% reported increased turnover in the six months up to September 2022, with 24% reporting a decrease. The biggest improvement was seen for the hotel and restaurant sector (78%). During the six months up to and including September 2022,65% of SMEs reported profit compared to 57% in 2021. In 2022, 12% reported a loss while 22% broke even. The average value of a credit application for new finance was €278,915, up notably from €208,469 in September 2021. The average value of applications for renewal/restructuring of existing finance has fallen to €396,419.61% of SMEs increased prices, 96% of which have done so to cover increased input costs.For 34% of SMEs, electricity costs are less than 21% of total energy costs. This is down from 42% on the previous wave. However, for 41% of SMEs, electricity costs are more than 60% of total energy costs. This is up from 32% on the previous wave of the survey. The average Irish SME had outstanding debt of just over €427,000, up from €400,000 on the previous wave.More than half (55%) of all SME outstanding debt was to retail banks, with the balance owed to non-bank bodies. This is down just 1% on the previous wave.Overall 40% of SMEs have no debt with construction and business services having the lowest level of debt. On the publication of the SME Credit Demand Survey Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath T.D. stated: “I welcome the results of the latest wave of the SME Credit Demand Survey. It enables Government to gain a critical understanding of the Irish SME landscape. This in turn enables Government to develop, refine and implement policy measures to support SMEs that are critical to Ireland’s economic performance and an important source of employment across the country. For example, the survey series has provided an evidence base to help inform Government’s response in supporting SMEs facing rising energy costs and the cost of doing business via the launch of the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme (TBESS) and the forthcoming launch of the Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme (UCGS) and the Growth and Sustainability Loan Scheme (GSLS). I would like to thank the businesses that partook in this survey wave”. Ends Note for Editors: Background of Report The SME Credit Demand Survey has been conducted biannually since 2011 to monitor trends in access to credit by SMEs. Please note while the survey is conducted on a 6 monthly basis, for presentation purposes, the report uses year-on-year comparisons. The report published today presents the results from the SME Credit Demand Survey April 2022 – September 2022. Conducted by Behaviour and Attitudes, all interviews were conducted between the 11th October and 1st December 2022 and covered the period from April 2022 to September 2022. The Department has conducted the SME Credit Demand Survey in order to have an independent and statistically significant report into the Irish SME landscape and the availability of, and demand for, credit that exists for SMEs. The survey was conducted through a telephone survey covering over 1,500 businesses. It drew a carefully constructed sample from a large database of SMEs, made repeated calls to ensure a full response and asked factual questions. The full questionnaire is included in the report. The report and previous reports are available on the Department of Finance website at https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/788135-credit-demand-surveys/. The results will be used to monitor the sector, identify any changes or emerging trends and to feed into the development of policy options with colleagues in other Government Departments including Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture Food and the Marine for Government to consider. Summary and key findings This report contains the results of the Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey. All interviews were conducted between the 11th October and 1st December 2022 and covered the period from April 2022 to September 2022. Throughout the report, the most recent wave of findings (referred to as September 2022) is compared with corresponding waves. This ensures that historical comparisons are being made on a like-for-like basis, taking any seasonal issues into account. Please note that due to Covid-19 restrictions, no interviewing was possible for the same period in 2020. Demand for Bank Finance: 17% of SMEs applied for bank finance in the 6 months to September 2022. Credit demand remained unchanged in the six months to September 2022, with 17% of SMEs reported that they applied for bank finance. When this is broken down by firm size, credit demand has increased slightly among micro companies (+1%) and decreased among medium sized companies (-3%). However medium sized companies continue to have the highest level of credit demand at 22%.17% of all SMEs expected to apply for finance in the following six months, up significantly from 7% in September 2021.The main reason stated for not seeking credit in the past six months was that the company had sufficient internal, a reason cited by 79% of business not seeking credit (up from 76% in September 2021). New loans, and leasing or hire purchase were the main finance products requested by SMEs, followed by new overdrafts.Credit demand was highest for the Construction (20%), Wholesale (17%) and Business Services (17%), while lowest for Hotels & Restaurants (13%) and Manufacturing (12%).The average reported cost of credit on outstanding loans was 5.13% – an increase from 4.59% reported in September 2021. 2% of SMEs reported having missed repayments of bank loans in the period – down from 5% in September 2021.5% of SMEs requested traditional finance (e.g. leasing or hire purchase, or new loan) from a non-bank provider in the six months up to September 2022. The most common type of non-bank finance requested was leasing and hire purchase (24%), followed by new loan (20%). The Application Process Of those companies that requested bank finance, working capital (41%) and business expansion (35%) were cited as the main reasons for making a finance request, followed by investment in machinery or equipment (17%). Compared to September, bank finance requests were down for business expansion, while up for working capital.The average value of a credit application for new finance was €278,915, up from €208,469 in September 2021. The average value of applications for renewal/restructuring of existing finance was €396,419, up notably from September 2021.Of those applying for bank finance, 27% had to provide some type of collateral (down from 42% in September 2021), with the main collateral types required being buildings and personal assets. The average value of collateral required as a percentage of the loan was 53%.60% of all finance applications were processed within the stipulated 15 working days of receipt of all information from the company. The average amount of time from application to decision was 26 working days. The proportion of loans that were still pending stood at 9%. The proportion of credit applications declined stood at 10% in September 2022, largely in line with the 9% reported September 2021. But the proportion of requests that was approved fully was down from 86% in 2021 to 83% in 2022. Decline rates were lowest for the Business Services sector at 5%, with the highest decline rates seen for Hotels & Restaurants (17%).In September 2022, 22% of SMEs that were refused credit reported that they were informed of their right to an internal review – down from 42% in September 2021, with a large proportion (38%) unable to recall whether they were informed of their right to an internal review. Just 26% of those who were refused credit reported that they were informed of their right to a review by the Credit Review Office, with 41% were unsure if they were informed or not. It should be noted these calculations are based on a very small base size of just 29 respondents. SME Supports and Initiatives A large majority of SMEs are aware of Enterprise Ireland (90%), Local Enterprise Offices (80%), and the Credit Guarantee Scheme (63%). 44% were aware of the Credit Review Office, and 52% were aware of Microfinance Ireland Supports. Just 5% were not aware of any government support.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Generation II images tease the designs produced in collaboration with EDAG Group Known for its top-level development of concept cars, prototypes and expertise in the international automotive industry, global mobility engineers EDAG was appointed by First Hydrogen in 2022 to develop design and styling for its zero emission light commercial vehicles (LCV). These first released images show the next generation’s front and rear detail. The front view features a smart digital panel, which shows the configuration of daytime running lights (DRL) designed to give the van a recognisable face and identity, as well as outstanding visibility. The rear elevation reveals vertical tail lights either side of the main cargo access point. The design follows function as it accommodates different types of doors including tailgates, barn doors and roller shutters. First Hydrogen briefed EDAG Group to assist it in the development of designs for large panel vans that can be scaled to different vehicle heights and lengths. The result will be modular vehicles that allow for customisation to suit operational use and can be employed for a wide range of applications including express delivery, grocery, construction and utilities work, emergency services and vehicle recovery. First Hydrogen revealed its Generation I fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) last year, which are now undergoing mileage accumulation and testing before commencing operational trials. From March 2023, the vans will be placed with fleet operators from the UK Aggregated Hydrogen Freight Consortium (AHFC), which include national supermarkets, utilities providers, roadside assistance and healthcare services. These real-world on road trials will enable operators to experience hydrogen transport solutions first-hand and help First Hydrogen engage with potential future customers and provide data to inform the development and production of its future vehicles. The global light commercial vehicle market size was valued at USD 480.52 billion in 2021. It is projected to reach USD 751.86 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.1% during the forecast period (2022-2030). FCEVs offer operational benefits for the zero-emission commercial van market and LCV sector with faster refuelling speeds, longer range, and larger payload, auxiliary load and towing capabilities. The First Hydrogen Generation II design will reflect this operational flexibility, ultimately supporting the Company to become leaders in efficiency and progress for zero emissions vehicles. Steve Gill, CEO of Automotive for First Hydrogen, says: “We’re thrilled to reveal this preview of our next generation of zero emission vehicles. Following the success of our Generation I demonstrator vans that prove our concept and technology capabilities, with this next series of vehicles, our goal is to provide the commercial van market with a complete solution for operational flexibility. This sneak preview indicates the careful consideration that has gone into combining aesthetics with engineering excellence; the vehicle configuration and signature light panels show a solid standout design that is iconic and will be a real head turner.” Bernat Costa, Design Director at EDAG Spain, comments: “The pure design of the light panels complements the vehicle’s functional purpose, establishing a First Hydrogen design signature and illuminating the van to improve its visibility for other road users in city and urban landscapes. This is especially important for delivery and roadside assistance vehicles, which need to make regular stops. The clean aesthetic also reflects the vehicles’ zero emissions status. We can’t wait to reveal more of the design as we progress on the project.” Further details on First Hydrogen’s next generation of green hydrogen vans will follow.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Councils seek €40 million to help beef up staffing in planning departments nationwide',\n",
       "  'text': \"COUNTY AND CITY councils have sought an additional €40 million from the Government for their planning departments, with requests for resources to beef up their staff by more than a third. Findings from a Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) report show that local authorities have asked for an extra 541 planning staff as of Q2 2022. A snapshot of this report – provided to TDs on the Oireachtas Housing Committee – says that, as of Q2 2022, there are 1,550 staff across planning departments in all councils. If provided, this would boost the total number of planning department staff across all councils to 2,091. According to the briefing note from the Department of Housing, 217 of the additional posts sought are within the planning policy area, while 212 are within development management. The remaining 112 posts are within the planning enforcement sector. The total cost of the 541 posts sought by councils is approximately €40 million, however the Government has only allocated €5 million to hiring additional planning staff. This would only add approximately 68 additional staff to planning departments nationwide. Social Democrats’ Housing Spokesperson Cian O’Callaghan said that this funding from the Government represented a “tokenistic approach” and that planning departments within local authorities are under-resourced. Leah Farrell Social Democrats' Housing Spokesperson Cian O'Callaghan Leah Farrell “Given the scale of the housing crisis we have and actually the huge deficit in terms of the provision of infrastructure alongside housing, it doesn’t make sense to be under resourcing housing,” O’Callaghan told The Journal. “If we want to get more delivery of housing and more delivery of infrastructure then resourcing planning, including forward planning, that’s an important part of it. “It’s a tokenistic approach really from the Government on this.” Sinn Féin’s Housing Spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin said that he wanted to see a “multi-annual” funding plan to help increase staffing levels across all local authority departments. “I think what we need is a plan. What I’d like to see is the Minister [Darragh O'Brien] and the LGMA engage with the Oireachtas Committee and work out what that plan is in terms of how much staff do they need when and how quickly they can be recruited,” Ó Broin said. He said that key aspects of planning policy come through both local development plans and local area plans, but that at present, councils do not have enough resources. “You’re not getting the kind of joined up infrastructure going with housing, so it’s very important that the area is properly resourced. Without that, we’re not going to get the kind of delivery, both of housing and the facilities we need with it.” There were initially cuts to staffing at planning departments nationwide following the 2008 financial crisis, with the Department estimating that 30% of staff were cut. Ó Broin told The Journal that local authorities have still not recovered their staffing levels following the crash. “Local authorities have never recovered back to their pre-2008 crash staffing levels. RollingNews.ie Sinn Féin's Housing Spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin RollingNews.ie “The local government lost 25% of its employees as a consequence of the austerity budgets post-2008, the single largest percentage loss across the public sector. “It doesn’t surprise me that the local authority managers are saying that their need for staff is far greater than what the Government has budgeted for.” The Department says that alongside recruitment of new staff, there will be a “concerted focus on upskilling, training and education”, with the Office of the Planning Regulator finalising a new training plan for councils. “Further work is underway to examine how the broader funding of the planning system and the need for greater cost recovery to ensure that funding is sustainable into the future,” the briefing note reads. Planning ‘logjam’ The briefing document comes days after a construction report showed that there is a significant “logjam” at An Bord Pleanála (ABP), with 59% Strategic Housing Development (SHD) applications in 2022 being stalled. The Mitchell McDermott Annual Construction Sector Report 2023 says that 28,786 units of housing remain undecided upon by ABP, with the delay being labelled as “unacceptable”. “Everyone knows the Board has had its issues this year but to have so many units delayed amid a housing crisis is unacceptable,” said Paul Mitchell, one of the report’s authors. “You would imagine this backlog could easily be addressed by drafting in additional temporary resources from private practice here or from the UK and we believe this should be done straight away.” SHDs have since been replaced with Large Scale Residential Developments (LRDs), which are applied for at the council level rather than directly to ABP. Concerns about the level of staffing within planning departments come as the Government last week published the Planning and Development Bill 2023, which is set to overhaul the current planning system. Under the bill, there will be a renewed focus on Local Development Plans, including extending their lifespan to ten-years.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"“I’ve seen the catastrophic effects of alcohol,” he said, outlining his experience as a liver specialist, and said that reducing the availability of alcohol is a “constructive way” of reducing harms. Sinn Féin Senator Fintan Warfield said that the measures contained in the proposed Sale of Alcohol Bill don’t simply come down to “industry vs public health”, and there are other stakeholders involved. “We’ve lost 85% of nightclubs in the last 20 years,” he said. “Hundreds of people are calling for change on this issue. Without extended hours, we’re going to lose those spaces for good.” The Government's legislation aims to revamp the country's patchwork of laws governing alcohol sales in pubs, restaurants and off-licences, some of which date back more than 200 years. Alcohol licences will be allowed for museums and galleries, while pubs will be permitted to stay open for longer until 12.30am, along with extended hours for nightclubs. The legislation has been welcomed in many quarters, including the pub and nightclub trade, and the Justice Minister has said it would help sectors “decimated” during the pandemic, and aim to diversify the night-time offerings in our towns and cities. However, there are facets to which they have taken exception or have sought clarity on. Publicans have said the removal of the extinguishment provision, whereby a new operator cannot enter the pub trade without first acquiring an existing licence, would have a damaging effect on rural pubs in particular. However, advocacy groups as well as doctors and psychiatrists have warned of the health risks of extending access to alcohol and the impact it could have on the health service and on crime. Speaking before the committee on Tuesday was the National Transport Authority, the Institute of Public Health, Mandate trade union, Alcohol Action Ireland and the Irish Community Action on Alcohol Network. The Institute of Public Health’s Ciara Reynolds said that systematic reviews of licensing hours internationally had found that “extending opening hours by even one hour increased injuries, assaults, drink-driving, car crashes and driving injuries”.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'McBurney Transport invests in 30 new trailers from SDC Ballymena based logistics company McBurney Transport is in the news again after taking delivery of 30 new Aluminium Boxvan trailers from manufacturer SDC Trailers in Toomebridge. The substantial investment signals a dedication by the company to strengthen its efficiency and operations for customers across the UK, Ireland, and Europe. Built to withstand the rigours of the road, McBurney’s new Boxvan’s feature three BPW Eco Air axles with low maintenance drum brakes and a roll stability braking system, along with internal load restraint rails, steel reinforced flooring, LED and ISO regulation lighting. The trailers are manufactured to SDC’s lightweight and durable design with a double-skin allow plank body and double-insulated roof, providing additional security and insulation of goods during transport. “We are very pleased with the new trailers from SDC Trailers,” said Norman McBurney founder McBurney Transport, “The advanced features and high-quality construction will help us to improve our operational efficiency and better serve our customers. The Boxvan trailers will join our modern fleet of over 1,300 trailers.“ Norman confirmed the recent announcement that Danish shipping and logistics company, DFDS will acquire the family-owned McBurney Transport Group in a move that will expand its network by joining one of the largest global groups in the sector. The acquisition is aligned with DFDS’ strategy of growing solutions within cold chain logistics. Headquartered in Copenhagen, DFDS operates on thirty routes, employing 11,000 staff in twenty countries connected by their ferry and logistics services. SDC’s Ireland Sales Manager, Jimmy McKernan said: “We would like to wish Norman, his wife Lynn, and the rest of the team best wishes for the future. They are a long-valued customer of SDC and it has been a pleasure to work together and support McBurney Transport over the years. McBurney’s latest order of 30 new Boxvan trailers are built to the highest standards of quality and durability, and I am confident they will serve McBurney Transport for many years to come.” Founded in 1965, McBurney Transport operates from eight locations, three in Northern Ireland, one in Ireland, three in England, and one in Scotland. Their customers range from multinational blue-chip corporations to local companies, major supermarkets, food and drink manufacturers, high street retailers as well as companies in the construction, horticulture, and industrial sectors. In Liverpool, McBurney operates a 25,000-pallet cold store, which facilitates the transport of cold chain goods throughout the UK.',\n",

       "  'title': '‘Not possible’ to make Northern Ireland Protocol work - EU law expert',\n",
       "  'text': 'A senior barrister has told a Westminster committee the Northern Ireland protocol is a question of “identity” and he does not believe it is possible to make it work. Responding to a question from the Conservative MP David Jones, Thomas Sharpe KC – an expert on EU law and a Conservative Party member – said there was a “sort of a commercial logic” to making it function for the business community in Northern Ireland. Asked specifically if it could work given its “democratic deficiency”, Mr Sharpe replied: “No, I don’t. It is a fundamental issue, who governs people in Northern Ireland. “It should be Stormont, it should be the UK parliament,” he said, agreeing the same principle should apply regarding the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the protocol. He was also asked about the role of the ECJ by the DUP MP Gavin Robinson and answered that it was “a question of identity. You just don’t want, any more than we do in GB, to have the European court telling us what the law ought to be.” A report in The Times on Wednesday suggested the EU and UK had struck a customs deal which could pave the way for a resolution of the issues around the Northern Ireland protocol, though this was subsequently dismissed by the Irish and UK governments who said no deal had been agreed. Commenting on the report, the committee chair, the Conservative MP William Cash, said there “might have been a bit of exaggeration here” and added that the members of the Committee “haven’t seen anything to scrutinise, which is the crucial issue”. Citing government sources, The Times also reported that Brussels has made concessions of the jurisdiction of the ECJ, a key sticking point in UK-EU talks. For the first time, it recognised that the ECJ could rule on Northern Ireland issues only if a case was referred by courts there, the newspaper said. Mr Robinson asked if, in Mr Sharpe’s opinion, there was a “construct which would remove ECJ whilst EU law applies to Northern Ireland or do you think, in totality, if you can be free from that legislative framework by consequence you remove ECJ”. Mr Sharpe said that “if you believe, absolutely fundamentally, whatever law you’re seeking to apply, EU or any other law, nevertheless, the Northern Ireland courts are perfectly capable of dealing with that, then you absolutely can take away the Court of Justice jurisdiction.” However, he also acknowledged it could prove legally difficulty to do so, adding that “it seems to me if you want to get rid of the Court of Justice you’ve got to get rid of the super structure of it [the protocol]”. Mr Sharpe was giving evidence on Wednesday to the European Scrutiny Committee, which is examining the UK government’s proposals to amend the Northern Ireland Protocol and the real world impacts they could have on businesses. Addressing the Committee earlier, Stuart Anderson, the Head of Public Affairs at the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the businesses had “seen the protocol impact in really significant ways, both positively, negatively and not at all, depending on the sector, the structure of supply chains and the historical nature of the business”. He said the body’s quarterly economic survey had demonstrated “quite a positive upward trend” over the last year, but added that investment was being “withheld” by some firms in Northern Ireland due to uncertainty. Fergus McReynolds, the Director of EU and International Affairs at manufacturing body Make UK, said it was “clear” that “co-operation with the EU is being held back while we are at an impasse” over the protocol and “we really need to start talking and co-operating with each other in a way that is being hampered at the moment”.

       "  'title': 'Engineers Ireland forecasts almost 8,000 sectoral jobs for 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Engineers Ireland’s latest employers’ survey, the first since the pandemic, has shown that a shortage of experienced engineers and the housing crisis are among the many barriers experienced by engineering employers undertaking recruitment for 2023. Damien Owens, Director General, Engineers Ireland, said: “Our recent survey has shown that 72% of member-respondents are majorly concerned about the shortage of engineers with the correct skills. These engineering employers see this shortage as the main barrier to business growth. We are all aware of the recent job cuts in the tech sector – many of them in the engineering area. It is important to stress that there are other sectors which are in urgent need of engineers e.g., construction and consultancy, with almost 8,000 new jobs anticipated in these sectors in 2023. “The engineering field is one of the most important in our society. Engineering touches the lives of everyone, providing creative solutions to societal needs from tangible works such as bridges and flood defences, to heart stents and prostheses as well as the invisible technology that is all around us. But there is a problem: there are not enough skilled engineers to meet demand. The skills shortage is nothing new. In fact, it has been an issue for years. To try and retain or seek talent, companies are upskilling, maintaining hybrid working, where possible and attracting talent from overseas.” The professional body for engineers has also warned that the shortage of engineers could potentially undermine the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 goals and ambitions. Project Ireland 2040 is made up of the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan 2021-2030. “In Project Ireland 2040, the Government has committed to actions on climate change and a ready supply of talented engineers will be fundamental to realising these goals. In 2023, the reality is that the number of students moving into third-level engineering and the technology sectors needs to be much larger to meet employers’ future needs for graduates. “If we don’t address the skills shortage soon, it could have negative effects on our economy and society. We urgently need more young people choosing careers in engineering. I would therefore strongly encourage students making their CAO choices, and particularly young women, to consider a career in engineering and the fantastic and expanding opportunities that exist in the sector,” Mr Owens continued. This call to action has come in advance of the CAO deadline of Wednesday, 1 February, which marks the application closing date for undergraduate courses. Damien Owens also said that an engineering apprenticeship, with many offering an ‘earn and learn’ experience, is an exciting opportunity for Leaving Certificate students who have an interest in engineering as a career, adding that: “An engineering apprenticeship can also be a proven way for employers to develop talent for their company, as well as opening up new and rewarding careers, with learning grounded in practical experience.” In addition to encouraging Leaving Certificate students to consider a career in engineering, Engineers Ireland is also calling on engineering firms, companies big and small, libraries, local authorities, schools, and third-level institutions nationwide to get involved in STEPS Engineers Week 2023. Taking place from 4-10 March 2023, STEPS Engineers Week provides primary and secondary school students with the opportunity to discover engineering through events and activities facilitated by their teachers, parents, and local community. The week-long celebration of the engineering profession is coordinated by Engineers Ireland’s STEPS programme – a non-profit outreach programme that promotes interest and awareness in engineering to school students – and is funded by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and industry leaders Arup, the EPA, ESB, Intel and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Irish economy has motored through a series of global crises – Brexit, the pandemic, soaring inflation – proving itself more resilient than anyone, even policymakers, could have predicted. It would be ironic, then, if it foundered on the domestic issue of housing. The sharp bounceback in activity since Covid appears to have brought matters to a head, with companies saying they are unable to expand, take on new orders or hire staff because of the lack of rental accommodation and the constraint that this puts on their business. Business leaders claim we have reached a tipping point on the issue, and that unless something is done to improve availability and affordability, Ireland’s jobs-rich growth model will stall. In a report this week, employers’ group Ibec said the shortage of housing had become a “critical barrier to continued growth and development” in the economy. An inadequate supply of affordable housing, it said, “was the single largest impediment to attracting and retaining talented workers, without whom business investment and expansions are not possible”. Padraig O’Neill, the managing director of Unum’s Technology Centre in Carlow town, a tech campus for US insurance giant Unum, says there are second-hand properties to buy in Carlow town and the surrounding area but there is little or no available rental property. At best, there are two to three properties available on property website Daft on any given day, he says. “The majority of the people we’re hiring are in the younger age bracket so they’re looking to rent not buy,” O’Neill says. “The culture of the company – being around experienced people, being able to learn – is being hindered because so many face long commutes or have to work remotely.” Unum currently employs about 230 staff, doubling its workforce during the pandemic, and offers flexible working. “We recruit a lot from surrounding colleges in Maynooth, Waterford and Carlow,” he says, noting that those from Maynooth and Waterford struggle to get accommodation locally. “We’re trying to build a brand in those colleges – one that suggests Unum Technology in Carlow is a great place to go for your internship [the company converts about 80 per cent of its interns into full-time employees] – but if it involves a two-hour commute, then that can really dampen the overall experience.” The exodus of smaller landlords from the market – a key factor driving the current undersupply of rental property – is particularly evident in Carlow, according to O’Neill. In a recent report, Daft said there were just 1,087 homes available to rent nationally on its website as of November 1st last, down about 25 per cent on the same date last year, and just 345 in Dublin. According to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI), about 40 per cent of property sales in the final three months of last year involved landlords selling their investment properties. The SCSI linked the exodus to “overly complex” rent legislation, low rental returns, and compliance with “onerous” housing standards. John O’Flynn, general manager of the five-star Fota Island Resort in east Cork, says the biggest challenge for the business is the rental market. “Typically at this time of the year, we would be going out to the different culinary colleges in Europe to bring in chefs for summer placements, but we just cannot secure a short-term rental or a long-term rental of any description,” he says. Whether employees can get accommodation in the local area has become a bigger issue for them than salaries and there is now an onus on the employer to provide the accommodation, O’Flynn says. While the hotel provides a certain cohort of staff with accommodation, the business has long since exhausted this option. O’Flynn says the big upturn in economic activity since Covid has generated an unrealisable demand for rental property. Demand in the hospitality industry (for leisure holidays, weekend breaks, corporate events) has never been as strong, he adds, but housing has “become a real barrier for us”. [ Merrion Hotel looks to provide staff accommodation close to five-star property ] He also highlighted a new phenomenon, with some construction companies working in the Cork area now using the Fota resort to house staff on a temporary basis for the duration of a project – and paying a premium to do so. “We wouldn’t have seen this type of business before,” O’Flynn says. From an employer perspective, there is a need to reinvigorate the policy drive around the availability and affordability of housing— Fergal O'Brien Ibec’s “Better Housing, Better Business” report, published on Monday, said the State’s housing crisis had increasingly become a concern in relation to cohesion in the workplace and society more broadly. “Younger workers, in particular, are financially pressed by ever-higher rents and the receding prospect of homeownership. This ultimately spills over into issues around well-being and productivity in the workplace,” it said. “Ibec members have detailed struggles to us when trying to fill key roles due to a lack of adequate affordable accommodation,” the organisation said. It called on the Government to urgently deliver policies to speed up the delivery of housing and to improve viability and affordability, including a temporary VAT refund to offset rising construction costs; and the introduction of a State fund, set up with proceeds from the Local Property Tax, to subvent the cost of levies for new homes. Ibec says up to 20,000 social, cost-rental and affordable homes should be provided each year. While new home completions rose to almost 30,000 last year, exceeding the Government’s 24,600 target, the 9,000 social affordable housing targets won’t be met. Unpublished research by the Housing Commission also suggests that the State may need up to 62,000 homes built per year until 2050 to meet demand – almost double the annual target of 33,000 contained in the Government’s Housing for All plan. Ibec urged the Government to progress its new Planning and Development Bill, which aims to overhaul planning here, amid complaints from industry that the system is entirely under-resourced and too slow. “From an employer perspective, there is a need to reinvigorate the policy drive around the availability and affordability of housing,” Ibec’s director of lobbying and influence Fergal O’Brien said. Ireland is not unique in facing a housing crisis. However, as a small, globalised economy, the availability of accommodation is an important economic enabler— AmCham chief executive Mark Redmon “This will require a suite of measures to improve the viability and affordability of homebuilding, such as addressing emerging financing deficits, reform of the planning and procurement system to speed delivery, a ramping up of ambition in affordable and cost-rental housing, and significant investment in skills and modern methods of construction,” Mr O’Brien said. Patrick Mulholland, managing director of medical devices company VistaMed, which is based in Carrick-on-Shannon in Co Leitrim, says it’s not the cost but the availability of housing that is proving the biggest headache for the company. The lack of supply is a constraint on growth, he says. The company has had to take a much more active role in securing accommodation for workers, including providing financial guarantees to landlords. VistaMed, which already employs 670 staff, is planning to recruit an additional 50 people over the next 10 months but that’s likely to prove difficult in the current climate, Mulholland says, Beyond that point, he believes housing will limit the company’s expansion. “I simply can’t see us going beyond 750 unless there’s a major shift in housing availability,” he says. “Housing will limit what business we can take on going forward. That’s the bottom line. As a global company, we would look for other destinations – other than Ireland – if we’re unable to locate the workforce here.” The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, which represents US business interests here, says it has consistently highlighted the delivery of housing as a key issue when it comes to maintaining current and securing future investment in Ireland. In a recent survey of member companies, 98 per cent said the availability of residential accommodation was important to maintaining FDI (foreign direct investment) employment in Ireland. “Ireland is not unique in facing a housing crisis. However, as a small, globalised economy, the availability of accommodation is an important economic enabler,” AmCham chief executive Mark Redmond says. “AmCham has been consistent in its engagement with Government in recommending a continued focus on enabling the on-time delivery of commitments under the Housing for All plan and the continued prioritisation of planning and capital investment in accommodation provision,” he adds, noting that reform of the planning process is key in supporting the development of housing and business growth. Simon McKeever, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, says: “A significant issue that has come more to the fore over the last number of months amongst Irish Exporters Association members is housing. Inflation and the cost of doing business are already pressing issues, but the acquisition and retention of talent is becoming a concern. “Companies are worried about the lack of housing and the cost of it and the impact this is having on their ability to be able to attract and retain talent, particularly when you get into more rural areas,” he adds. A recurring problem in Ireland has been the stress on infrastructure from a massive expansion of the private sector. Since 2014, the Irish economy has grown by more than 50 per cent, largely as a result of a spike in investment and employment almost exclusively in the private sector. The surge has created more than 400,000 jobs – 25 in the private sector for every one in the public sector – but a myriad of bottlenecks across the economy. Housing is perhaps the most obvious manifestation of this.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris TD has today (3 February 2023) welcomed the official launch of Safe Pass Renewal online. Safe Pass Renewal was announced by Minister Harris in December 2022 in line with Housing for All objectives to reduce barriers to careers in construction. Wednesday marked the launch of the live online renewal system on the SOLAS website. Safe Pass Renewal removes the need to take a full day off work, and significantly reduces waiting times for current card holders. Speaking today, Minister Harris said: “I am delighted that Safe Pass Renewal is officially live and available to current Safe Pass card holders. They now have the opportunity to renew their cards in a quick, efficient and streamlined manner. “This initiative is an important milestone in my Department’s response to Housing for All as it works to remove barriers and increase participation in, and engagement with, our construction sector. “In addition, the cost to renew online is half the cost of an in-person assessment and only takes 45 minutes, meaning our workers won’t miss out on a day’s wages.” Safe Pass Renewal is a self-directed learning model, where candidates can access revision material and undertake the test in a registered and controlled test centre. Safe Pass Renewal assessments will take place in one of 30 approved Pearson VUE exam centres which are located throughout the country. The online renewal costs €93.84 and consists of 50 multiple choice questions to be answered within 45 minutes. Following a review of the Safe Pass Renewal process, the Questions and Answers Booklet fee of €12 has now been waived, furthering the cost-effectiveness of this option to those looking to renew. Card holders can still continue to renew their cards through the existing tutor lead programme delivered in a classroom setting, if they wish to do so. Minister Harris added: “I’d like to reiterate my thanks to all stakeholders who assisted us in developing Safe Pass Renewal and bringing it on stream. SOLAS, CIF Trade Unions and members of the Construction Industry Advisory Group have all been crucial in the development of this initiative.” Andrew Brownlee, CEO of SOLAS, said: I am pleased to welcome this new streamlines system which will benefit and support the broader construction sector and enable a faster, more cost-efficient method to renew Safe Pass cards for all workers in construction. “Safe Pass has been a vital cornerstone in safeguarding the health and safety of our construction sector for many years now. “This important step forward will provide an alternative model that reduces costs, days off site, and time for workers who hold a Safe Pass card. “Lots more information about this new system and Safe Pass itself can be found online as www.solas.ie/safepass.” ENDS',\n",

       "  'text': 'The FTSE 100 fell back from Friday’s record high in a dent for the recent recovery in trading sentiment. Surging US jobs figures from Friday and a hawkish speech by Bank of England rate-setter Catherine Mann indicated that there is still room for further interest rate increases.London stocks slid on Monday as a result, with housebuilders among those falling after PMI construction figures showed the weakest sector performance for almost three years.By the end of the day, London’s top index had declined by 65.09 points, or 0.82%, to 7,836.71p.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: “European markets have taken a step back today as the aftermath of Friday’s bumper US payrolls continues to reverberate through the market.“The FTSE 100, having hit a new record high last week, has slipped back, along with the rest of Europe’s markets, as yields continue to rise, building on the surge we saw on Friday.“External monetary policy committee member Catherine Mann, who is the main hawk on the Bank of England rate-setting committee, has added to the upward pressure on bond yields by saying that rates in the UK will have to continue to rise, and that it is better to lean towards over-tightening than being cautious.”Weakness early doors from the Asian market, particularly among technology and property stocks, leaked immediately into trading sentiment across Europe.The Dax closed down 0.84% and France’s Cac 40 fell by 1.34% by the close.In the US, the main markets picked up where they left off on Friday to drop in the face of rising yields.Meanwhile, sterling hit its lowest against the dollar for a month after the US greenback continued to see the benefits of the bumper payroll report.The pound was down 0.39% against the dollar at 1.200 and was 0.34% higher against the euro at 1.120 at the close.In company news, Superdry moved higher after founder and chief executive Julian Dunkerton upped his stake in the fashion retailer, despite denying reports that he is planning to take the company private just days earlier.The group said Mr Dunkerton has increased his stake in the company to 24.3% from 23.9%. As a result, shares in the business improved by 2.4p to 123.4p.Elsewhere in retail, investors were less positive about Frasers after reports the Sports Direct parent firm could buy two UK shopping centres for around £100 million.The Sunday Times reported that the Mike Ashley-founded operation is in advanced talks to buy The Mall in Luton and is also considering a deal for the Overgate centre in Dundee.Frasers shares moved 9.5p lower to 793.5p on Monday.The price of oil rebounded from its lowest levels in three weeks amid concerns about how the earthquake in Turkey could impact nearby oil terminals.Brent crude oil increased by 0.85% to 80.62 US dollars (£67.14) per barrel when the London markets closed.The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 were Airtel Africa, up 4p at 117.4p, Centrica, up 1.7p at 96.96p, GSK, up 21.4p at 1,461p, Fresnillo, up 10.6p at 827.4p, and National Grid, up 6p at 1,040p.The biggest fallers of the session were Prudential, down 64.5p at 1,289.5p, Ocado Group, down 24.8p at 713.8p, Hargreaves Lansdown, down 31.2p at 918.4p, BT, down 4.3p at 130.35p, and Land Securities, down 20.6p at 721.2p.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The number of job opportunities in Kilkenny will grow by 15% in the coming year, according to a new forecast from FRS Recruitment, one of the country’s leading recruitment agencies. This follows on from the 9% increase experienced in Kilkenny in 2022. While Kilkenny experienced a significant level of growth in 2022, the counties to experience the highest increases included Dublin (up 36%), Clare (up 31%), Wicklow (up 34%), Sligo (up 15%), Cork (up 15%) and Roscommon, which recorded the highest year on year increase with the number of roles more than doubling (up 101%). 18 of the 26 counties in the Republic experienced an increase in openings in 2022. The largest decreases came in Kerry (down 10%), Leitrim, (down 9%) and Louth (down 7%). [articlepreview id=\"1029527\" link=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/sport/1029527/success-at-home-and-abroad-for-kilkenny-athletes.html\"] Nationally the number of job postings handled by FRS Recruitment rose by 32% in 2022, reaching a total of 107,802 – up from 81,528 in 2021. Year on year the monthly increase was across 11 of the 12 months and illustrated the return of the market to post pandemic normality, with the level of jobs aligning with 2019, the last pre Covid year of activity. Despite the surge in opportunities available, the number of people applying for jobs was down last year. FRS Recruitment recorded a total of 123,305 job responses in 2022 as it became a “candidates’ market” in some sectors. This meant the average response rate per role was at 1.14, down from 1.66 in 2021. On a sub sector level the largest increase in roles experienced in 2022 was in Banking & Financial Services, which were up 106%. This was followed by opportunities in IT – Software Development (up 67%) and IT – Support Services (up 46%). Significant growth was also recorded in arts, entertainment and recreation (up 43%), education & training (up 31%) and professional services & practices (up 25%). FRS Recruitment is also forecasting further growth in IT, construction and healthcare recruitment for the year ahead, describing these sectors as “relatively inelastic”. [articlepreview id=\"1028981\" link=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/home/1028981/graignamanagh-named-in-top-ten-most-charming-irish-villages.html\"] The analysis is contained in FRS Recruitment’s ‘2022 Review and 2023 Trend Forecast’ Report. Speaking about the report, Lynne McCormack, General Manager with FRS Recruitment said, “We are confident that we will see further growth in recruitment opportunities in Kilkenny for the year ahead. We experienced a strong year in Kilkenny last year and our belief is that this will continue over the coming 12 months. “Both in Kilkenny and nationally we believe there will be strong opportunities in the IT, healthcare and construction sectors. There has been such a build-up in openings across these sectors over recent years that they have become relatively inelastic and that will continue throughout 2023. Not all parts of the economy will rise in 2023, but we are very optimistic about the prospects in those particular sectors. [articlepreview id=\"1027526\" link=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/what-s-on/1027526/alone-to-host-valentine-s-afternoon-tea-party-with-kilkenny-lions-club.html\"] “Another trend we saw in Kilkenny and across the economy last year was that the level of applications did not keep up with the number of openings. With the economy reaching a 20 year low for unemployment and nearing full employment, this impacted the market. For some high demand sectors it became a candidate’s market. This, coupled with the rising cost of living, meant significant pressure on salaries in some high demand sectors over 2022. With the economy likely to be less buoyant in the next year, we expect this pressure will diminish as candidates in Kilkenny and nationally focus more on job security and work life balance considerations,” Ms. McCormack concluded.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Searches for part-time and weekend work soar amid cost-of-living squeeze',\n",
       "  'text': 'Searches for part-time and casual work surged in 2022, according to Indeed, with the recruitment company citing the impact of inflation on the cost of living. New data from the job site suggests there has been a “noticeable uptick” in job searches for part-time and weekend work, as well as jobs requiring no experience. Indeed said this increase likely reflected the need for those normally on the outskirts of the job market – such as the long-term unemployed or younger people – to enter or rejoin the workforce due to the financial squeeze felt from rising inflation. The top two searches in Ireland in 2022 were “visa sponsorship, healthcare assistant”, which rocketed 532 per cent, and “visa sponsorship, elderly care”, up 421 per cent. “Working visa sponsorship” came in at number six on its chart, up 214 per cent. Indeed said this could largely be attributed to inward searches for these positions from abroad, and echoes previous research that indicated that the Republic is one of only five European countries experiencing a “brain gain”, with more inward job searches from overseas than the reverse. Indeed’s latest wage tracker figures point to a general slowdown in wage growth to 4.4 per cent in the Irish labour market in December, indicating that wage growth rates have fallen below their 2022 peaks and remain well below the 8.2 per cent inflation rate recorded in the final month of last year. “These trends clearly show that jobseekers are feeling the pinch right now as wage growth sits at roughly half of inflation rates. Salary, benefits and job security are the main priorities for them when considering their career. However it’s possible we may see less frequent job-hopping as people become wary of moving in an uncertain environment,” said Jack Kennedy, economist at Indeed. “Rising searches for part-time and weekend work potentially reflects that people who need flexibility, such as parents, students, or people who are semi-retired, want to engage in the workforce in a way that can fit into their lives,” he said. Meanwhile, FRS Recruitment is forecasting growth in job postings in IT, construction and healthcare, with the company’s general manager Lynne McCormack saying there is “pent up demand” in these sectors. “In the IT sector, for example, even though there been some really significant and disappointing job redundancies announced by some of the major tech companies in recent months, we believe this will create movement in the market as smaller employers see this as an opportunity to source difficult-to-find, highly skilled talent.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'No plastic bottles, cups or cutlery: UCC eliminates single-use materials from campus',\n",
       "  'text': 'University College Cork (UCC) is eliminating all single-use plastic throughout restaurants, shops and vending machines as part of a wider drive to create a more sustainable campus. The university, which published its five-year strategic plan on Tuesday, is also creating the first dedicated sustainability and climate action office in Ireland’s higher education sector. To assist with the push to go plastic-free, water refill stations have been placed across campus, thousands of reusable cups have been handed out to staff and students and mini dishwashers have been installed across various locations. UCC president Professor John O’Halloran said “people and the planet” are at the heart of its development plans for the campus. “Together the UCC community has created a roadmap that will secure our future so that we can continue to inspire and shape future generations, while also providing the expertise and insight to meet the challenges our society faces,” he said, at the launch of the report on Tuesday. The move to go plastic-free came from students, he said, and has given the university a chance to become an “experimental ground” for how the rest of society can take similar measures. “This is a community of 25,000 students, 3,500 staff ... We estimate that UCC is the 14th largest settlement in the country,” he said. The new office of sustainability and climate action will be tasked to deliver on a range of environmental targets, while ensuring learning, teaching, research and operations lead the transition to a more sustainable future. The blueprint for the university also places a big focus on developing new postgraduate programmes, boosting international student numbers and widening student access to higher education. It plans to offer increased pathways into university courses from further education and is seeking to widen access to postgraduate education through philanthropy and other sources. Prof O’Halloran said about 23 per cent of its students come from “non-traditional pathways” and about 47 per cent of students at the university avail of student grants. It was important, he said, to ensure postgraduate options are made more accessible for all students. “The key is making sure that funding is not a barrier ... I’m a first generate graduate myself and a lot of support will be required,” he said. “We’re not in favour of students loans or anything like that. ... I lived in the US and we’ve seen the damage that it creates.” He said he was hopeful that the Government will deliver on promised additional funding for the sector to help ensure universities can provide all the supported needed for new students. Prof O’Halloran estimated that while universities received about €4,000 per student in Government funding about 10-15 years ago, this has since dwindled to about €1,500. Yet, over the same time period, the student intake has grown more complex with additional needs. On the question of student accommodation, he said the college’s Crow’s Nest development at Victoria Cross is close to completion and the university aims to provide a total of 2,000 student beds within the time frame of the strategic plan. Thousands of other beds are available in private, purpose-built student accommodation. “Affordability rather than availability is the issue,” he said, adding that its campus-based accommodation was pitched below competitor’s prices. The strategic plan also includes a programme of research prioritisation coupled with an academic recruitment across ten indicative areas of strategic importance. UCC said it has been actively recruiting leading researchers globally and placing a strong emphasis on attracting and supporting early career researchers. Prof O’Halloran said the university’s research is now focused on the “global grand challenges” as identified by the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. There are also plans to create a student forum, or a representative assembly of students, to enable constructive consultation and participation with university leaders.',\n",

       "  'text': 'An EU-wide shortage of qualified mechanics is creating “extraordinary pressure” for the National Car Test (NCT) service while a “driver availability” issue is hampering plans for the redesign of the Dublin bus network, according to a briefing document prepared for Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan. The document, drafted in December and published on Tuesday, outlines how the department is continuing to progress three public transport “megaprojects” – BusConnects, Dart+ and MetroLink – and states that “assuming timely planning approval from An Bord Pleanála” as well as other matters, construction work on the MetroLink could start in late 2025 and it could begin operating in the early 2030s. [ Driving examiners ‘put at risk’ after ruling that cars without NCT can be used for tests ] [ Average NCT wait times still rising amid confusion over ‘free tests’ ] The document notes backlogs in the NCT system have been receiving “prolonged media and political scrutiny” since the start of last year. “The contractor is providing additional vehicle inspectors from its Spanish operation,” the report notes, while the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has approved a pilot scheme to use additional inspection staff for automated test elements, and non-EU testers are receiving training. There will be no reduction in the quality of the tests being carried out, according to the report, and the department has received assurances from the RSA that the appointment of additional resources will not result in the loss of any existing jobs. Investment in public transport, which was €524 million in 2020, is expected to grow to €851 million this year, while from 2021 to 2025 it is envisaged that the equivalent of 20 per cent of the 2020 transport capital budget – approximately €360 million annually – will be invested in walking and cycling infrastructure on a whole-of-government basis, according to the report. [ Motorists entitled to free NCT tests over delays, but none have been offered, TD says ] [ NCT mechanics reject plan to hire auxiliary staff in effort to tackle backlog ] Hundreds of villages and rural areas are to be connected to the national bus network as part of a five-year Connecting Ireland plan. Priority is being given to areas where “the population and transport demands have increased due to the requirement to house Ukrainian refugees in rural locations”. In order to achieve the “ambitious levels of emissions reduction required in transport”, base demand is among the matters that have to be addressed, according to the report. A National Demand Management Strategy, to be developed this year, will consider a broad range of measures and their sequencing and timing, with the measures mentioned in the report including the removal of free workplace parking, increased parking charges, congestion and road-user charges, and increased fossil fuel prices. On aviation, the report notes that the pandemic caused airline passenger numbers to plummet globally but that a recent projection by Eurocontrol envisaged Irish passenger numbers returning to 2019 levels in 2023 and throughout Europe the following year. “Recovery is ongoing, and at a pace that surpassed initial predictions,” according to the report. “While aviation’s contribution to economic development has long been acknowledged and the importance of connectivity for an island nation is well-understood, the imperative to act to reduce our emissions across all sectors is also fully recognised,” the report said. On the introduction of a tax on aviation fuels, the report says “progress continues to be very slow at EU level with varying views between member states.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Housing for All – Q4 2022 Progress Report published - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': \"The Government today published the progress report for Quarter 4, 2022 under Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland. In the first full calendar year of the plan, almost 30,000 (29,851) new homes were completed, exceeding the target by over 20%. Construction started on 27,000 new homes in the year, the second highest since 2014. Strong activity has also been seen in the area of mortgage approvals, particularly for First Time Buyers (FTB), with recently published data showing FTB volumes at their highest levels since 2007. The supply of homes is increasing despite considerable challenges in the external environment. Since the launch of Housing for All, over 41,456 new homes have already been built. Actions during Quarter 4 include: Increased funding through the Affordable Housing Fund and the Cost Rental Equity Loan to make cost rental homes available at affordable prices. Help-to-Buy Scheme extended to the end of 2024 and consideration being given to expansion of the First Home Scheme to cover self-build housing. The Scheme, operational since July 2022, will support the purchase of 2,000 homes by eligible buyers in 2023. Funding of €94m provided to local authorities to address legacy land debts. Provision of this funding linked to the immediate development of a housing proposal, a commitment to use Modern Methods of Construction and construction to start in 2023/2024. Overall, over 30 sites have been identified for acceleration, involving over 1,500 new social homes. Launched Construct Innovate, Ireland’s Construction Technology Centre, to accelerate research and innovation in the construction sector. Publication of Report on the Analysis of Skills for Residential Construction and Retrofitting 2023-2030, along with Action Plan to attract and retain the necessary workforce – identified need for almost 51,000 new entrantsto meet the Government’s housing and retrofitting targets over the period to 2030. Developed Vacant Homes Action Plan, with several incentives available if you are turning a vacant house or building into your permanent home. €500 Rent Tax Credit for rent paid in 2022 and protection for renters by deferring any ‘no fault’ tenancy terminations from taking place this winter. Pre-Letting Expenses for landlords increased from €5,000 to €10,000, the length of time that a property must be vacant to be eligible reduced from 12 to 6 months. Publication of draft Residential Zoned Land Tax Maps as part of the implementation of the Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT). In addition, significant reform is underway including through the publication of a new Planning and Development 2023 Bill and approval by Government on General Scheme of Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones Bill. While progress has been strong, 2022 also saw the emergence of unprecedented challenges, leading to high inflation and rising interest rates. These issues are having a negative impact on the financial viability of home development and Government is focused on solving this through schemes such a Project Tosaigh and Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme. A new call for proposals was launched under Project Tosaigh in Q4 and the evaluation of responses is nearing completion, to be prioritised in accordance with 2023 and 2024 figures. The Housing Agency is now concluding appraisals of projects with the potential to build up to 2,100 apartments under the Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme, following the European Commission’s approval of Ireland’s State aid application for the scheme. Letters of approval will now be issued to successful applicants from the first call. Commenting on the publication of the report, the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar TD said: “Government is fully committed to reversing the trend of falling home ownership and rising homelessness. We are determined to make home ownership a reality for the many again. “This can only be achieved by increasing the supply of homes of all types. We have made good progress in the first full year of the Housing for All plan, and we will continue to work with stakeholders to accelerate and enhance the plan as we implement it. It is a comprehensive plan and, working with the Minister Darragh O'Brien, I will do all I can to drive it forward. “We need new and innovative ways to supply homes; no option will be taken off the table without due consideration. “We must apply the same spirit of determination, action and immediacy that we saw during the pandemic, to solving this social crisis.” The Tánaiste, Micheál Martin said “Homelessness is one of the greatest challenges facing our society today and a serious concern for Government. Though actions implemented in Quarter 4 such as the short-term ban on no-fault evictions, and actions taken to address the fundamental shortage of housing in our country, particularly social and affordable housing, we will turn the tide and provide homes for those in most need in our society” The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan said: “The adoption of Modern Methods of Construction has the potential to significantly improve construction sector productivity, innovation, sustainability and costs. In December, the Government launched Construct Innovate, Ireland’s Construction Technology Centre, to accelerate research and innovation in the construction sector. Already, a series of research projects are underway. The Centre is just one of several initiatives that will further support the use and development of Modern Methods of Construction in the delivery of Housing.” The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O’Brien TD added: “We are making significant progress in tackling vacancy and dereliction. Last week I launched the Vacant Homes Action Plan which details the upcoming measures that will bring even more vacant properties back into use. The new €150 million URDF call for proposals will help local authorities transform vacant and derelict buildings and sites in order to revitalise and regenerate our cities and large towns, and deliver more housing”. Notes to Editor Housing for All ‘Housing for All’ is the Government’s housing plan for Ireland to 2030. It can be read at www.gov.ie/housingforall. The plan’s overall objective is: ‘Everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life.’ The Housing for All – Q4 2022 Progress Report and Quarterly Statistics Report can be read here: https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/9d2ee-housing-for-all-quarterly-progress-reports\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Transport spending: Town and local bus services are the priority, says Eamon Ryan',\n",
       "  'text': 'The priority for the €3.5 billion spending by the Department of Transport this year is the development of local link and town bus services, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan has said. In a discussion of the estimates for his department for 2023, Mr Ryan also said enhanced port development, designed to take advantage of a multibillion investment in the offshore wind farm sector, requires a “leap of faith” by the ports but has to be delivered. Addressing the Oireachtas committee on transport on department spending plans on Wednesday, Mr Ryan told Darren O’Rourke TD (SF Meath East) local link and town bus services represent the number one priority. “It is closing the gap where there is nothing in many instances,” he said. “Yes we should be faster but we are opening new bus services week in, week out.” The Minister said next week the National Transport Authority would present new routes that will open. “This should be the number one priority and it is,” he said. My Ryan said although road building would continue, the coming two years would see a shift in funding of two-to-one in favour of active travel and public transport. He revealed just €240.009 million of €1.387 billion earmarked for roads and road safety has been allocated to the construction of new national roads this year. Some €70 million will be spent on new regional and local road improvement schemes. Road schemes include the ongoing Dunkettle Interchange in Cork City, the N5 Westport-to-Turlough route in Co Mayo, the Listowel bypass in Co Kerry and N59 Moycullen bypass in Co Galway. Projects with planning approval that will continue to progress towards construction phase include the N28 Cork-to-Ringaskiddy road and the retendered N5 Ballaghdereen-to-Scramogue scheme in Co Roscommon. The Minister told TDs and Senators €358 million would be invested this year in “active travel” including the Safe Routes to School scheme on which the Department of Transport was working with local authorities to design and implement changes that would make it more attractive for people to chose active or public transport over the private car. “Tactical interventions in urban areas at low cost to deliver quick active travel wins,” he said. Mr Ryan said big ongoing active travel projects included the Clontarf-to-Amiens Street route in Dublin and the McCurtain street scheme in Cork. “My intention is that these demonstrator projects will pave the way for more widespread behavioural change in how we engage with transport as a society,” he said. Mr Ryan said from this year Government supports to encourage people to move to electric vehicles would switch from grants for private vehicles to investing in public EV charging infrastructure, He said BusConnects “spines” would continue to roll out with the planned introduction of South Dublin City orbital routes while planning would continue on BusConnects for regional cities. Overall, €876.504 million has been allocated to public transport including the balance of the order of 41 Intercity Railcars that will increase capacity on the intercity network. Construction will also continue on the National Train Control Centre, and tenders will be issued for the redevelopment of Ceannt station in Cork. The Cork Commuter Rail project, part-funded through the EU’s National Recovery and Resilience Programme, will also be progressed, he said. A total of €15 million is to be invested in rail and public transport accessibility projects. Mr Ryan said although ports are not directly funded by the exchequer “offshore renewable energy should be supported strategically, given its potential for addressing future energy requirements, decarbonisation, security of supply, and job creation in emerging industries of the future”. He said the demands of the offshore industry included quays with a water depth of at least 11 metres and length of between 400 and 500 metres. Although this investment would have to be made before the ports were awarded contracts to facilitate the deployment of turbines, blades and towers, it was “a leap of faith” that the port companies would have to make. Questioned by TDs and Senators on the possibility of this work going to ports such as Hamburg, Mr Ryan said Irish port infrastructure “will be delivered. It has to be”.',\n",

The work stoppages, which at least 270 Siptu members are expected to take part in, will to take place on 1 and 8 March. During the planned stoppages, Siptu members will place pickets at the Go Ahead Ireland depots in Ballymount, Dublin 12 and Naas, Co Kildare. Siptu representatives carried out a ballot for industrial action of its members employed by Go Ahead Ireland on 20 December. “In the ballot, an overwhelming majority voted for industrial action if management continued to refuse to engage on the issue of pay,” Siptu sector organiser John Murphy said. He said that following the vote, Go Ahead Ireland management agreed to attend talks at the Work Place Relations Commission but would not engage on the issue of pay. Siptu then referred the dispute to the Labour Court which it claims Go Ahead Ireland is refusing to attend. “The current collective agreement takes no account of the significant additional cost of living increases our members and their families are facing,” Murphy said. “Siptu representatives remain available to engage in constructive negotiations with management at all times. However, due to its appoach on this issue we fear industrial action is inevitable,” he said. Go Ahead Ireland operates a number of routes previously serviced by Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.

       "  'text': 'The Minister for Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform, Paschal Donohoe TD, has today 10th February 2023, launched an updated Investment Projects and Programmes Tracker and updated MyProjectIreland interactive map. Project Ireland 2040 sets out a clear long-term strategy for public capital projects in Ireland backed by funding of €165 billion over a 10 year period as presented in the National Development Plan 2021–2030 (NDP). The updated Tracker and Map published today on http://www.gov.ie/2040, showcases the steady progress being made in the delivery of the NDP. The Tracker and Map were last published in May 2022. Speaking today, Minister Donohoe said: \"I am delighted that there continues to be significant advances made in the delivery of Project Ireland 2040. The investment tracker and interactive map provide citizens with a comprehensive overview of the capital projects being delivered in their own areas. This year my Department has increased capital investment by a further 10% to over €12 billion. This represents a solid pipeline of activity that will continue to support jobs across the construction sector.\" This Tracker update, which incorporates user-friendly dashboards, provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments that make up Project Ireland 2040. It focuses on over 320 projects and 140 programmes with estimated costs greater than €20 million. The Minister also said: \"Over the lifetime of the NDP, we are investing €165 billion in new and upgraded infrastructure that meets the needs of our growing population and enables delivery of our national priorities around critical areas such as housing, health and climate action. With the unprecedented scale of investment in the NDP, the ambition of the Government is clear. The Tracker and the Map published today demonstrate the many successes we have had in the delivery of the NDP so far. \"Delivering the NDP is a huge undertaking but we must, and will, continually strive to ensure that projects are completed on time and on budget. That is why the Government has decided to sharpen the focus on delivery even further in 2023. Reflecting its change in name, my Department is examining how the support structures and levers at Government’s disposal can be used to drive delivery, in support of my colleagues in Government who are the key players in the management and delivery of all our NDP projects. \"The Government is determined to deliver on the vision set out in the National Development Plan. Success will mean a better Ireland for the benefit of all our people.” ENDS',\n",

       "  'text': 'CONTRACTS have been signed for the design and construction of a multi-million euro development at the Opera Site in the heart of the city centre. Limerick Twenty Thirty has also announced details of a €80m joint venture which will boost the development of the Opera Square site-wide basement and the six storey One Opera Square office building. Located at the corner of Michael Street and Ellen Street, the project is Ireland’s largest scale development site and works are scheduled be completed by 2025. Details of the joint venture, which involves Limerick Twenty Thirty and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) means that the One Opera Square project have been confirmed by the Minister for Housing, Darragh O\\'Brien, who is on a visit to Limerick this Monday. The 3.7 acre site will be transformed into a daytime employment hub, as well as offering 450,000 square feet of accommodation to the people of Limerick. Commenting, Minister O’Brien said: “Opera Square will be a transformative development for Limerick, and I’m delighted the Government has been able to support Limerick Twenty Thirty in bringing it to fruition. The regeneration and rejuvenation of our towns and cities is a key part of this government’s vision. “We are tackling vacancy and dereliction, and will continue to fund important regeneration projects in the country.” Separately to the funding announcement, Limerick Twenty Thirty has confirmed the appointment of John Sisk and Son for the design and construction of the circa 10,000sqm Opera Square site-wide basement and six storey One Opera Square office building.

Mayor of the City and County of Limerick, Cllr Francis Foley welcomed this Monday\\'s announcement: “This is a hugely significant moment for the wider Opera Square development, Limerick and, indeed, the Mid-West region. This is the moment when we can finally say that, two decades after the redevelopment of this site was first mooted by the private sector, building is now finally underway. One Opera Square is one of the flagship projects in the Opera Square programme which, together with other private and public investments already underway in Limerick, is going to transform our city centre, setting it on a new course that will make it one of the most competitive and attractive locations in Europe to live, work and play in.” Nick Ashmore, Director of ISIF, added: “This is an important step forward in our €500m investment programme to unlock the economic potential of Ireland’s five regional cities. We are delighted to show our backing for Limerick and the wider mid-west region with our biggest single investment to date from this programme. Our investment is about making Limerick an even better place for employers to create more jobs and making it an even more attractive place for people to work. Limerick has so much going for it and ISIF looks forward to backing more investments in the city and the region over the coming years.”',\n",

       "  'text': \"Dublin bus operator Go-Ahead “must pay staff more during the cost-of-living crisis” to avoid unnecessary strikes next month, according to a Labour TD. Duncan Smith is calling on Go-Ahead Ireland management to engage with SIPTU immediately to avoid widespread strikes and disruption across the bus network over the coming weeks.According to SIPTU, members will stage 24-hour strikes on March 1 and March 8 with pickets at the company's depots in Ballymount, Dublin and Naas.“The refusal of Go-Ahead to engage in meaningful talks on pay that will honestly take into account the impact of the cost-of-living crisis is utterly regrettable,” Labour transport spokesperson Deputy Smith said.“SIPTU members in Go-Ahead are not immune from the inflationary pressures that hundreds of thousands of workers are facing and they need to see some real light at the end of the tunnel.“The reality is that the current collective agreement takes no account whatsoever of the significant additional cost-of-living increases workers are facing. That needs to change.“Across the water, the same company has agreed a significant pay deal for its workers and the demands for a similar approach to be taken for the company’s 300 workers in Ireland is a fair and reasonable one.“The onus is now on Go-Ahead management to pull out all the stops and respect the plight of their hard-working staff.“They must immediately, meaningfully engage with union representatives and do everything in their power to avoid these unnecessary strikes,” he added.The dispute over pay has come due to rising costs facing workers and businesses nationwide.SIPTU Sector Organiser, John Murphy, added: “SIPTU representatives conducted a ballot for industrial action of our members employed by Go-Ahead Ireland on December 20.“This vote was required due to the refusal of management to engage through the normal agreed process in talks concerning an increase in pay for our members to take account of the impact of the cost-of-living crisis.“In the ballot, an overwhelming majority voted for industrial action if management continued to refuse to engage on the issue of pay. Following this vote, management did agree to attend talks at the Workplace Relations Commission.“However, at these talks it refused to engage on the pay issue separately to other matters. We then referred the dispute to the Labour Court, which the company is now refusing to attend.”SIPTU Organiser, Andrew Quigley, added: “Our members are frustrated at the refusal by management to engage constructively on the issue of pay rises.“The current collective agreement takes no account of the significant additional cost-of-living increases our members and their families are facing.“In the UK, the same company has reached an agreement for a significant increase to its employees’ pay in line with inflationary pressures. We are demanding a similar approach be taken with its over 300 employees in Ireland.”Independent.ie has contacted Go-Ahead Ireland for comment.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Minister of State for Trade Promotion and Digital Transformation, Dara Calleary, TD, today turned the sod on the site of the new Advancing Innovation in Manufacturing (AIM) Centre in Sligo. The new facility will focus on developing capability in cutting-edge manufacturing technology in companies across the Northwest region.This innovative project is driven by Atlantic Technological University (ATU), Sligo County Council and Leitrim County Council and is supported by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment administered through Enterprise Ireland.Speaking at the event today Minister Calleary said; “I am delighted to be here in Sligo to formally turn the sod on the new home for the AIM Centre at the old fire station at Market Yard. This is an ambitious, innovative project that will provide companies across the Northwest with access to new and emerging manufacturing and supply chain management technology. There is a technological revolution occurring in this important sector and it is vital that Irish enterprise is ahead of the curve in adapting to change. As well as helping businesses adapt and become more competitive, projects such as this are crucial if we are to develop a resilient enterprise ecosystem to provide high-quality jobs and employment opportunities for people to live and prosper in all regions.“I would like to acknowledge the vision of Atlantic Technological University, Sligo County Council and Leitrim County Council in championing this important project, which my Department is proud to support with funding of almost €2 million delivered through Enterprise Ireland’s Border Enterprise Development Fund.”Welcoming the commencement of construction work, Councillor Michael Clarke, Cathaoirleach, Sligo County Council, said; \"Today marks a huge step forward in bringing this very innovative and forward-looking project to fruition. I want to acknowledge the huge effort, vision and collaboration of all the key players, including the Atlantic Technological University, Enterprise Ireland, Rhatigan Architects, the contractor, Joseph McMenamin & Sons Ltd., Julie Dowling, Director of the AIM project and of course my colleagues and staff in Sligo County Council. This project has the potential to be a gamechanger for industry in Sligo and beyond, while also boosting local trade.\"Dr. Chris O’Malley, Vice President of Research, Innovation and Engagement with ATU said; “Manufacturing is undergoing a technological revolution with tens of thousands of jobs at stake across our region. ATU is delighted to collaborate with Sligo County Council, Leitrim County Council and Enterprise Ireland in taking this initiative to help our companies address that challenge, drawing on the expertise and facilities across all the ATU campuses and partner networks across the country and beyond. It’s about putting knowledge at the service of the region.”Recently appointed director of the AIM Centre, Julie Dowling said; “It is fantastic to see the renovation work on the old fire station commence. Whilst we await the use of our state-of-the art facility, several cutting-edge projects are already in-flight with businesses in the region. Currently the AIM team are operating out of Sligo ATU Innovation Centre. We have a team of experienced resources in the fields of artificial intelligence and analytics, robotics and automation, business strategy, research and engineering. Businesses are under pressure with ever changing landscapes brought about from Brexit and covid, followed by an energy crisis, global inflation, and talent retention issues. New technology can assist organisations with such challenges, and the AIM centre have the resources to help find the optimal solution for them.”Carol Gibbons, Divisional Manager, Regions and Local Enterprise, with Enterprise Ireland said; “It is really positive to see this great project coming to fruition with the formal sod turning today. I am confident that the knowledge and expertise located in the Aim Centre will be of immense benefit to companies across the Northwest region as they use emerging technology to drive productivity and competitiveness. This project is one of 11 transformative projects currently being supported by Enterprise Ireland through the Border Enterprise Development Fund, a specific initiative to support entrepreneurship in the Border counties post-Brexit.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'In its submission, The Irish Home Builders Association, a part of the Construction Industry Federation, will tell politicians that there are potentially 70,000 homes awaiting a decision by An Bord Pleanála. The association will also say that a judicial review of homes that have already been granted permission can add between €10,000 and €20,000 per unit to build costs. Housing Minister Darragh O\\'Brien\\'s bill looks to limit access to judicial reviews to those who have a material interest in a development. The statement, which will be read by the IHBA\\'s director Conor O\\'Connell, says that housing commencements, which were down 13% last year, will have fallen dramatically in the last 12 months when figures are compiled. \\'Time is money\\' \"We estimate that there are over 70,000 housing units waiting for a decision in An Bord Pleanála and in the courts, nearly two years\\' supply of homes. \"The old expression that “time is money” has never been more appropriate in the current economic environment as increases in the cost of materials, the rising interest rates, and other factors mean that the extraordinarily long delays being currently experienced in the planning and legal system results in more costs being added to a new home. \"These are adding unnecessary delays to our younger generations securing their new homes. Commencements have declined by 13% last year and we expect that planning permissions will see a dramatic decline over the last 12 months.\" Mr O\\'Connell will tell the committee that while there are many planning permissions already granted for homes, most in urban areas are for apartments. He will say apartments have \"always been a challenge to deliver due to their high delivery costs and it will be difficult to see many commence in 2023\". Objections He will say government schemes such as Project Tosaigh and the Croí Conaithe cities scheme may yield results in terms of apartment commencements in the latter half of 2023 but demand for traditional housing units remains strong and is the preference for most people. Mr O\\'Connell will tell the committee that house builders trying to deliver homes are \"concerned they may run out of permissions in areas of high demand in late 2023 and that the resourcing in the planning system is \"at a critical juncture\" and will argue for stronger safeguards around planning objections. \"We have seen objections based on the claim from individuals that their houses may be devalued. We have seen objections to housing from organisations or individuals living several hundred kilometres away from the site, we have seen politicians objecting to housing who, at the same time, are calling for more housing. This simply cannot continue if we are serious about an inclusive and harmonious society where the provision of housing is facilitated by the state with appropriate legislation and procedures.\" Representatives of Property Industry Ireland, the Ibec group for the construction and property sectors, will tell the committee that finance has become an issue for builders and potential homebuyers. \"In the delivery of new homes, homebuilders face many challenges. At present, the growth in input cost inflation is impacting on viability and the new home pipeline. Financing is now a particular constraint. Interest rate rises have had a major impact. There are supports for owner-occupiers, but a critical challenge will be in the delivery of homes to rent. Uncertainty can also play a key role in homebuilders decision-making.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Joint agents Cushman & Wakefield and Sherry FitzGerald New Homes are guiding a price of €59 million for the Rockpoint apartment development in Blackrock, Co Dublin. The scheme, which is under construction currently and due for practical completion in the final quarter of this year, will comprise a total of 91 apartments distributed across two blocks. Aimed towards the upper end of the private rented sector market, the development will consist of a mix of 49 one-bedroom apartments, 38 two-bedroom apartments and three three-bedroom units, along with 71 underground car-parking spaces. Rockpoint is well located in Blackrock and just 7km southeast of Dublin city centre. The scheme is situated just off the Frascati Road (N31) and within a short walk of both Seapoint and Blackrock Dart stations and Blackrock Village itself. While the €59 million being sought for the development equates to a significant average price of €648,351 per unit, the selling agents say they expect rents in Rockpoint to range from €2,600 to over €4,000 for the larger units. The portfolio is being offered to the market by way of a forward-purchase agreement on behalf of Seabren Developments – the company led by Michael Moran of the Red Cow Moran Hotel. Seabren acquired the 0.5-hectare Rockpoint site from developer Pat Crean’s Marlet Property Group in 2020 for about €7.5 million. At the time of that sale the former Europa Garage lands had planning permission in place for a smaller development of 42 apartments and nine houses. Seabren secured planning permission for the present scheme from An Bord Pleanála in 2021 in the face of objections from a number of parties including the former president of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.',\n",

       "  'title': 'US says new weapons will help Ukraine mount ‘decisive’ spring offensive',\n",
       "  'text': 'Ukrainian officials denied Russia’s claims that its invasion force had taken more territory in eastern Ukraine, and the United States said the West planned to give Kyiv the weapons needed to achieve “decisive” results in an expected spring offensive. Heavy fighting continued in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as the European Commission unveiled plans for a 10th package of sanctions against Russia, and Nato said its members were ramping up ammunition production to keep supplies flowing to Kyiv and replenish its own stocks. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Wednesday that during an offensive by its forces in Luhansk region, “Ukrainian troops retreated in disarray to a distance of up to three kilometres from previous positions. Even the enemy’s more fortified second line of defence could not stop the breakthrough by the Russian military.” Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of the partly occupied Luhansk region, said claims that Russian troops had pushed Kyiv’s forces back to the border of the province “do not correspond to reality – our forces are holding the line”. “We see there is an escalation, especially in the direction of Bilohorivka and Kreminna. There is a lot of shelling and aircraft are already involved – the Russians are constantly attacking in waves from different sides,” he added. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the most intense fighting was now taking place around the towns of Bakhmut and Vuhledar in the Donetsk region. Describing Bakhmut as a “living wall” that holds back Russian forces, he said Ukraine’s people “are standing strong, defending themselves resolutely, and they understand they are a fortress that allows Ukraine to prepare for the de-occupation of all its territories”. Referring to the February 24th anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of his country, Mr Zelenskiy said “there is a feeling that the new year in Ukraine now starts on the 24th… We want this year to be a year of victory.” After a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said recent western pledges of tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, missile systems and other modern weaponry were intended to ensure that Ukraine’s forces “can be decisive on the battlefield in their upcoming offensive”. “And so with that additional capability, better trained troops, platforms that can perform a lot better in this environment, I think they’ll have a real good chance at making a pretty significant difference on the battlefield and establishing the initiative, and being able to exploit that initiative,” he added. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said member states were stepping up production of ordnance in response to Ukraine’s use of “an enormous quantity of allied ammunition” which was “depleting our stockpiles”. “So the production of, for instance, artillery shells… is now increasing, and that enables us to both replenish our own stocks… but also to continue to provide support to Ukraine,” he explained. “We have seen the big need… and now we see that contracts are signed and production is ramping up.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to undermine Moscow’s ability to wage war in Ukraine by imposing export bans worth €11 billion, which would “deprive the Russian economy of critical technology and industrial goods”. The sanctions would hit electronics, specialised vehicles, machine parts, spare parts for trucks and jet engines, and goods for the construction sector that could be used by the Russian military, including antennas and cranes. Dual-use and advanced technologies are also to be hit, with 47 electrical components that can potentially be used to power Russian drones, missiles and helicopters set to be barred from export to Russia, along with certain rare earth materials and thermal cameras.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Dublin City Council pays 40% over the odds for social housing, audit finds',\n",
       "  'text': 'Dublin City Council has been paying in excess of 40 per cent more for the construction of social housing than private sector developers, an independent audit of more than 1,000 Dublin homes has found. Council officials had been “severely restricted” in their ability to control costs within Government and EU procurement rules and systems, according to the report by public management consultancy Seán Ó Riordáin and Associates Ltd and Trinity College economics professor Ronan Lyons. The “review of the construction costs associated with the council’s building of housing units” was commissioned by the council after concerns were raised in 2021 that it was paying a “premium” for the construction of social housing with costs that were significantly higher than those achieved by approved housing bodies (AHBs) and private developers. The analysis of 28 housing schemes across the three sectors, with a total of 1,023 homes built between 2019 and the end of last year, found the council was paying 23 per cent more than AHBs and 44 per cent more than private developers for a similar two-bedroom apartment. When the all-in costs of development were taken into account, and the apartments weighted for their size, the review found one-bedroom apartments provided directly by council cost €335,000, 11 per cent above the equivalent figure for AHBs (€303,000) and 34 per cent above the figure for “Part Vs “(€250,000). Under Part V legislation developers are required to allocate a number of homes for sale to local authorities for social housing. For two-bedroom homes, the council construction costs of €514,000 were 23 per cent above the AHB average of €418,000 and 44 per cent above the Part V average €358,000. The council paid an average of €600,000 for the construction of three-bedroom apartments during this period. However, as only a small number of “non-council” three-bedroom properties were built during the three-year period, they were excluded from the analysis. The difference in costs could, in part, be attributed to the differing nature of the projects, the report said. Council schemes were generally smaller, with an average of 43 homes compared with a private sector average of 180, of which 18 were set aside for social housing. Council schemes were typically regeneration or “brownfield” sites which were more costly to build on than private developers’ greenfield sites. Nonetheless, “it would not be appropriate to conclude that cost differentials between public and private delivery can be explained entirely by scale... and wider project nature”, the report said. “Issues such as the application of public procurement rules and the impact of policy shifts, application of differing standards in the use of construction materials, etc, can and do impact upon the cost environment for both public and private delivery of construction.” In addition, it said “councils do not have the option of entering into long-term commercial relationships where long-run production of construction materials and predetermined fixtures and fittings can be facilitated as is the case for private-led investment”. The systems used to develop these homes meant the capacity for council officials “to make substantive decisions around cost control was severely restricted, particularly when there were changes in regulatory specifications and requirements at a national level that had an impact on costs”. Following the introduction of the Government’s Housing For All policy, an international cost management framework was being introduced to local authorities which should assist in the council controlling costs, the report concluded. Fine Gael councillor James Geoghegan said it was “a serious concern that proper accounting and cost control measures and procedures were not in place” when these homes were built. “Because of how these projects were managed, the council was not able to maintain control over costs, and what this report shows is that Dublin City Council paid a premium price for that.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Macra has criticised the omission of construction costs for new milking parlours under the new Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS). The Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) yesterday (Monday, February 20) published details of TAMS 3, including the Dairy Equipment Scheme (DES), which details the eligible items and the reference costs. Tranche 1 of the €370 million scheme will open on Wednesday (February 22) with solar panels on farms being the first available investment. Other investments will become available on a phased basis during Tranche 1 which will close on June 16. The president of Macra, John Keane, said that the decision not to include building costs for new dairy parlours in the scheme will come as a “major blow” for young farmers starting out in the dairy sector. “It comes as no surprise unfortunately that the construction costs are not covered under the new TAMS 3. “We have seen a consistent disregard for young farmer supports from the department over the past few years. “Under the last Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) construction costs were eligible for new milking parlours for those qualifying under the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme but the new scheme appears not to cover this cost for young farmers,” Keane said. TAMS The Macra president called on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Charlie McConalogue to urgently review the new TAMS. Keane said that farmers who availed of grant aid for robotic milking equipment under the previous TAMS are “also excluded” from the new scheme. “This compares to those who availed of support for solar installation under TAMS 2 are eligible once more under TAMS 3. “At a time when labour is in short supply and the associated benefits for data collection and management garnered by using robots we see the minister excluding farmers who availed of support previously for robotic milking equipment,” he said. “This move is grossly unfair to these farmers as there was no indication in the previous TAMS that any investment under the last CAP would affect future access,” Keane added.',\n",

       "  'text': 'House prices have stretched to almost eight times the average salary, the largest gap for more than a decade. The figures come from the latest MyHome.ie/Davy Q4 Property Price Report, which predicts that residential prices will rise by 4pc this year, down from 6pc last year.It says that prices rose by 3.6pc in Dublin over the last 12 months and by 7.6pc outside the capital. However, all regions experienced price falls in the last quarter of the year, with Dublin falling the most, at 0.8pc.The report comes as property prices in the UK have fallen for four consecutive months, the longest negative run since the height of the previous property boom in 2008.House prices in most major western markets are expected to decline this year, according to a recent Reuters poll, after increases of up to 50pc since the start of the pandemic in 2020.Since 2013, average house prices in Ireland have risen by over 130pc, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO). However, the MyHome.ie/Davy report claims that it is still cheaper to own a house than to rent, comparing CSO private rent rises of 11pc last year to average mortgage rates of under 3pc.The report predicts that the final figure for housing completions last year will be 28,400, above the Government’s previously stated target of 24,600. However, it warns that this year will be an “especially uncertain outlook” due to external pressures, despite the “resilience” of the property market last year amid high energy prices, inflation, interest rates and the war on Ukraine.Nationally, the median asking price for a house is €330,000, down 0.4pc for the quarter but up 6pc for the year, according to the report.In Dublin, the median price is €436,000, down 0.8pc for the quarter but up 3.6pc for the year. Outside Dublin, the media price is €283,000, down 0.2pc for the quarter but up 7.6pc for the year.The report says there were 15,000 available properties for sale on MyHome.ie in the fourth quarter, more than the same period a year ago but still below pre-pandemic levels. The average mortgage approval rose to €280,600 in October, up 4.3pc on the previous year, while the average time in reaching a “sale agreed” status in the last quarter was 2.7 months nationwide which the report claims is indicative of “a very tight housing market”.Overall, residential property market transactions will settle at over €21bn for 2022, according to the report, up 7.5pc in volume on 2021.The author of the report, Davy chief economist Conall Mac Coille, warned that buyers were stretched to a degree not seen since 2009.“The average residential transaction in Q3 2022 was €370,000, now 7.7 times the average income of €48,000,” he said. “This is a similar valuation multiple to the UK, where house prices are now falling due to a surge in mortgage rates above 6pc.”He said that “already stretched valuations” in Ireland could be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times’ income. He said this gives an “upside risk” to the 4pc house price inflation prediction for next year.He added that recent months had seen worrying trends in the home-building sector, with housing starts slowing and the construction PMI survey pointing to the flow of new development drying up.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The latest quarterly housing report for MyHome.ie found inflation in asking prices for homes dropped in the last three months of 2022, as is typical for Q4 of a year, but 3% of homes listed for sale actually dropped their price. Over the year, asking prices rose by 6% to a national median of €330,000. In Dublin, median asking prices rose 3.6% to €436,000, while they rose 7.6% outside of Dublin to €283,000. The median asking price in Cork City rose 5.3% in the year to €279,000. A typical two-bed apartment in Cork, meanwhile, rose 5% to €205,000. Davy chief economist Conall MacCoille, who authored the MyHome.ie report, warned the figures show buyers are being stretched to a degree not seen since 2009. “The average residential transaction in Q3 2022 was €370,000, now 7.7x the average income of €48,000,” he said. “This is a similar valuation multiple to the UK, where house prices are now falling due to a surge in mortgage rates above 6%.” Mr MacCoille said already stretched valuations of homes in Ireland could be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times’ income. Describing it both as a “key development” and a “surprise decision”, the economist said the Central Bank estimates it will eventually add 8% to Irish house prices over three years. But he said this 8% could all come in just one year. “It is quite possible that first-time buyers could act more quickly to take on more leverage on their borrowing as they compete for the limited pool of homes listed for sale,” Mr MacCoille said. “This poses an upside risk to our forecast for 4% house price inflation in 2023.” Elsewhere in the latest MyHome.ie report, it says 15,000 properties were available for sale on the platform in Q4, which is still below pre-pandemic levels. The average time to sale agreed in Q4 was 2.7 months, indicative of a “very tight” housing market. The average mortgage approval in October was €280,600, up 4.3% on last year, while the statistics show that, “for those who can get on the ladder, there is an incentive to buy over renting”. Recent trends in the homebuilding sector, however, are described as worrying, with the construction PMI indicator pointing to the flow of new development potentially drying up. Mr MacCoille said the Government’s new First Home scheme “will help overcome viability concerns on housing developments arising from build cost inflation”. But the pick-up in funding costs could well impede apartment development, he added, which has been reliant on institutional investment into the private rental sector. He said it remained the case the market for apartment blocks built for ordinary home buyers just is not there. He said an opinion remains apartments cannot be built and just sold off to ordinary home buyers, as they are expensive to build and difficult to secure finance for. “We still expect housing completions will pick up to 28,400 in 2022 and 27,000 in 2023,” he said. “However, the outlook for 2024 is far more uncertain. The Government’s ambitious plans to expedite planning processes are welcome although, as ever, the proof will be in the pudding.”',\n",

The issue calmed down in December due, mainly, to the availability of thousands of student teachers. These subs are back in college and the issue will come back into focus once again. Norma Foley has pointed to a host of initiatives aimed at boosting teacher supply such as easing employment restrictions for teachers on career breaks, job shares, etc – but, at its heart, this is an issue tied up with the housing crisis. Many teachers have relocated to cheaper parts of the country or abroad. If meaningful progress is to be made, expect more radical moves such as funding teacher education, more permanent contracts or fast-tracking recognition for teachers abroad. Otherwise, it will rumble on. Leaving Cert reform: battles ahead Most senior cycle reform plans will take years to realise – but the rubber hits the road this year with plans for students entering senior cycle in September 2023 to sit paper one in English and Irish at the end of fifth year. Standing in the way are teachers’ unions. English and Irish teachers’ groups feel especially aggrieved over changes that they say will hurt students. Others see this as a proxy fight over wider plans to introduce teacher-based assessment for up to 40 per cent of marks. Foley insists the changes will ease the burden on students. The future of senior-cycle reform may well hinge on getting this over the line. Free schoolbooks: jostling over costs to parents Funding of almost €50 million was announced in last September’s Budget to provide free schoolbooks and “related classroom resources” to all 540,000 pupils attending primary schools. However, education publishers and independent booksellers believe there are not enough resources to fulfil this pledge and they plan to join forces to highlight these issues in the new year. Some in the sector estimate the allocated funding is in the region of between €80-90 per pupil, yet research by the Irish League of Credit Unions puts the average cost of books at primary level at €110. Expect jostling over whether there is sufficient money to deliver the announcement or whether parents will be expected to fund the difference. Abuse inquiry: ensuring accountability A Government inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse by priests at some of the country’s leading private fee-paying schools looks set to be announced later this month. The calls for an inquiry followed, in particular, recent revelations of historical child sexual abuse in schools run by the Spiritan congregation, particularly at their Willow Park school and Blackrock College in South Dublin. The inquiry will need to be carefully constituted to ensure it enables survivors to have their voices heard and does not impede any Garda investigation. It is a complex task which, based on experience, may take years to complete. Learning loss: the shadow of Covid-19 Incredibly, there is no Department of Education report yet into the extent of any learning loss linked to Covid school closures. Yet, many other jurisdictions have long since quantified the degree to which students have fallen behind. Research from the Netherlands, which had a shorter period of school closures, indicates that primary children performed on average 20 per cent worse on standardised tests and some disadvantaged pupil scored up to 60 per cent worse. Anecdotally, school leaders in Ireland point to a range of deficits – yet, funding has been pulled for Covid catch-up learning programmes. We may see shortly the first indications of any learning gaps in international surveys. The Pirls (Progress in International Reading Literacy Study) was conducted in autumn 2021 among student in fifth class. Those results, due soon, will be revealing. School funding: ‘one-off’ measures to continue The Government announced “once-off” funding of €90 million for schools to cope with higher energy bills, equivalent to a 40 per cent increase in school capitation, last October. But few observers expect the cost of energy to dip significantly in 2023. Similar levels of funding, then, are likely to be needed to help school make ends meet later this year. As any politician will tell you, it’s always difficult to end once-off measures which, inevitably, appear as spending cuts. As a result, we may well see a new era of better-resourced schools where fewer are forced to constantly seek parental contributions. Lifelong learning: making college more affordable While we are star pupils across a number of education metrics, we’re nowhere near top of the class when it comes to lifelong learning. Latest Eurostat figures show just under 14 per cent of workers aged 25 to 65 in Ireland participate in upskilling to bolster their professional development, well below participation rates in Sweden (34 per cent) and Finland (30 per cent). The EU’s lifelong learning target is for at least 60 per cent of the adult population to participate in some form of training every year by 2030. So, expect to see moves to make college more affordable and accessible for lifelong learners such as Susi grants for part-time students, greater prior recognition of learning and moves towards more micro-credentials for time-pressed upskillers. Primary curriculum: biggest changes in 20 years A shake-up in how teaching and learning takes place in primary schools – the most dramatic in 20 years – is on the way. A new framework for the primary curriculum, currently under consideration by Norma Foley, could see a reduction in time allocated to religious faith formation and other core subjects. Instead schools would be given much more “flexible time” to decide which areas of learning they want to prioritise. The draft changes could see an increased emphasis on areas such as PE, digital learning and the introduction of foreign languages, education about world religion and ethics, and a broader arts education. Anxious generation: what’s bothering our schoolkids? School principals have expressed concern over rising levels of emotional ill-health, anxiety and mental health problems in schools since the pandemic. Teachers are not experts, psychologists or mental health professionals - yet this is the type of help many pupils need. A new pilot project to provide in-school counselling is due to begin this year. It will be watched closely to see if it can meet children’s needs and become a model for how to better respond to children’s needs. School meals: move to expand scheme A Government programme provides funding towards the provision of free meals to about 1,600 schools benefiting 260,000 children. A report that will shortly be on the desk of Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys – whose department funds the scheme – has a bold recommendation: expand school meals to all primary children by 2030. It sounds fanciful. On closer inspection, it may well be achievable. School meal companies currently provide hot meals to order across many schools that don’t even have canteens at relatively low cost; and under an EU child guarantee, all children in need should have access to a healthy school meal each day. Skills gaps: more apprenticeships Ireland is facing urgent skills gaps across a range of areas such as construction, retrofitting and renewable energy, to name just a few. Increasingly, policymakers see the further education and training sector as key to providing a pipeline of skilled graduates in these areas and others. A key obstacle has been a status problem: many parents and students see it as a “second best” option after college. This year more students will begin to see the smart option of “earn and learn” options which, in many cases, deliver jobs, degrees and decent earnings. School buildings: delays ahead Soaring construction inflation in the latter half of last year ate into the budget for new school buildings. Basic building costs in the education sector, based on tender outcomes, grew by 21 per cent in the first half of last year. There is no sign of these trends abating. With fewer projects taking up more limited resources, it seems inevitable there will be knock-on effects on the delivery of new school buildings and other major projects. Special needs: assessing children’s needs Education authorities were forced to pause the roll-out of controversial school-based education assessments for children with additional needs following concerns among principals, teachers’ unions and campaigners. Campaign groups warned that principals did not have the expertise to identify children’s support needs and warned that the system was potentially unlawful. The health and education system will need to urgently develop a fit-for-purpose model to ensure vulnerable children do not slip through the net. [ Breda O’Brien: School hiring rules need to be reformed to make it easier to find substitute teachers ] 2022: A good year for ... Norma Foley: she secured a record budget, announced free schoolbooks at primary level and an ambitious education reform plan for senior cycle ... now she just has to deliver them. No pressure, then. Technological universities: Following a decade-long campaign, the southeast Technological University was finally established with the merger of WIT and IT Carlow. The new university has a total student population of 18,500 students across four campuses. SNAs: More than 1,300 who completed a UCD training programme were officially recognised as a level-six awardee, the first step towards securing a new entry qualification for classroom professions beyond 3 grade Ds in the Junior Cert. ... and a bad year for: Schools in need of Irish teachers: ... or maths, home economics, woodwork, language teachers, etc Students seeking beds: A combination of late Leaving Cert results, a dire shortage of accommodation and rising rents posed acute problems for many PhD students: Many who earn below the minimum wage are faced with inflation and a cost-of-living crisis. Will a new review improve matters?',\n",

       "  'title': 'Amazing snapshot of life in Ireland in 2022 released by CSO',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Central Statistics Office has released a snapshot into Irish life in 2022. The release is the first part of an overall release of figures and the initial figures concentrate on Society & Environment. Other statistics will be released shortly. Amongst the many details released in the first batch of information includes the most common Irish name for babies, fraud figures and where Ireland’s most energy efficient homes are. The CSO 2022 Highlights section, based on data published by the CSO throughout 2022 up to 12 December 2022, is divided up under the following topics: Our Lives; Our Working Life; Our Society; Our Lives Online; and Our Environment. Population As of Census night on 03 April, the preliminary population count of Ireland in 2022 is 5.1 million – an increase of 7.6% from Census 2016 and the largest population recorded in a Census since 1841. It also showed that all counties experienced a growth in population. Looking at Population and Migration Estimates, there were 768,900 people aged 65 and over living in Ireland as of April 2022, which was an increase of 139,100 people since 2016. The proportion of the population now living in Dublin has also increased to 28.4% of the total in 2022 and now stands at 1,451,000 people. Ukrainian Arrivals As of the week ending 06 November 2022, there were 62,425 people who had arrived from Ukraine to Ireland, of which 34% were aged 19 or younger. Using Census 2016 figures we can see the impact of the war, as at that time there were 4,624 people who were born in Ukraine but were usually resident in Ireland. Names When it comes to naming our children, we picked a wider variety of names for girls in 2021 (4,741 names registered in 2021) than boys (3,863). Fiadh topped the most popular name for girls in 2021 for the first time, ousting the perennially popular Grace, while Jack remained as the most popular name for boys. The number of babies born in 2021 was 58,443, an increase of 2,484 on 2020. The 2021 total is almost 22% lower than 10 years ago when 74,650 births were registered in 2011. The top 10 surnames for babies in 2021 were Murphy, Kelly, Ryan, Walsh, Byrne, O’Brien, O’Connor, O’Sullivan, McCarthy, and Doyle. Weddings Our brides and grooms are getting older as the average age for brides in 2021 was 35.4 years and 37.4 for grooms in opposite-sex marriages. While the most popular form of ceremony for opposite-sex couples was a Catholic ceremony (40%), it was closely followed by civil ceremonies (34%). Deaths Cancer and circulatory disease were the biggest causes of death in Ireland, according to figures published in November 2022, accounting for 5,152 (or 55.2%) of deaths in April, May, and June (Q2) 2022 compared with 3,848 (or 57.4%) in Q2 2021. There were 1,724 deaths due to dementia in Q2 2022, of which, 1,051 (61%) were female and of the 527 deaths due to Alzheimer’s, 355 (67%) were female. COVID-19 Deaths & Vaccinations The number of deaths where COVID-19 was identified as the Underlying Cause of Death (UCOD) in 2021 was 3,011 (or 9.1% of total deaths). Our COVID-19 Vaccination Series in October revealed that just 14% of employees across all sectors were not fully vaccinated and the Accommodation & Food Services sector had the highest percentage of employees who were not fully vaccinated at 23% as of 31 August 2022. Education When it comes to educational attainment, more than half (53%) of 25–64-year-olds in 2022 have a third level education, the highest level in the EU-27. The release published in November also showed that over the last 10 years, there has been an increase in the proportion of those aged 25-64 years old with a third level education, from 40% in 2012 to 53% in 2022. A release in April showed that 80% of 2019 graduates were in substantial employment in the first year after graduation and their median or mid-point earnings was €555 per week. Our Working Life Employment A record rate of employment was recorded in Q2 2022 of 73.5% – the highest rate since the current series began in 1998. The number of people in employment increased by 3.4% to 2,554,300 in the year to Q3, while the estimated total number of hours worked per week in Q3 2022 was 80.3 million hours, up by 3.2 million hours or 4.2% on Q3 2021. The number of people employed rose by more than 650,000 over the 10 years to Q3 2022, and the number of unemployed people fell from just over 350,000 to 120,000 over the same period. Job Satisfaction According to a survey published in April, the majority of employees were satisfied with their job with more than one quarter (25.9%) saying they were very satisfied, while nearly two-thirds (63%) said they were satisfied. However, one in nine employees were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their job. Remote Working We are also changing how we work, as another survey also published in April showed that almost four in ten employees were remote working at some point during 2021, while only one in twelve (8%) workers had availed of some form of remote working pre-COVID-19. Almost three-quarters (74%) of remote workers surveyed said they felt they had more time on their hands while working remotely. Our Society Our social surveys paint a picture of how we live and how we feel. Wealth The Household Finance and Consumption Survey 2020 published in May showed the median net wealth value of Irish households was €193,100. In 2020, 97% of households had some form of savings, (deposit or savings account or positive balance on a current account) with a median value of €8,700. As of Q3 2022, Irish households were saving 19% of their income, down from 20% in Q2 2022. The release published in December noted this was still significantly higher than pre-pandemic savings levels of around 10%. Deprivation However, our most recent Survey in Income and Living Conditions (SILC) release in November painted a different picture as the proportion of people living in enforced deprivation increased from 13.8% in 2021 to 17.1% in 2022. The number of people unable to afford to keep the home adequately warm increased from 3.2% in 2021 to 7.4% in 2022, and households with at least some difficulty in making ends meet increased from 42.0% in 2021 to 49.3% in 2022. Another SILC Survey in May put the at risk of poverty rate at 11.6% in 2021, compared with 13.2% in 2020. Without COVID-19 income supports, the at risk of poverty rate would have been 19.9%. Child Deprivation A number of surveys captured the situation of lone parents, with an online CSO Pulse Survey indicating that 41% of lone parents reporting feeling lonely all or most of the time. Figures published in October 2022 showed that single-parents were more likely (12%) to be unable to afford two pairs of properly fitting shoes for their children when compared with 1% of two-parent households. Trust In June we learned that of respondents to a Pulse Survey who lived alone, 92% said they felt safe and secure in their home, while 83% said they have someone to count on if they had a serious personal problem. A separate Trust Survey published in March found that almost three in four (74%) respondents aged 65 and over were very comfortable with asking a neighbour to keep a set of keys to their home for emergencies. Renters More than three-quarters (76%) of respondents who lived in shared rented accommodation with non-family members said in a Pulse survey they felt like they would never be able to own their own place. Renters also featured in the child deprivation indicators publication, with almost 10% of households that rent unable to afford new clothes for their children, compared with 1% of owner-occupied households. In a separate Pulse Survey, 43% of those renting would consider emigrating to lower their cost of living while 57% of respondents aged 18 to 29 were considering it. Cost of Living Almost every respondent (94%) to a survey conducted in November and published in December said they had made cutbacks, with 62% cutting back on utilities (electricity, heating, etc.), 51% buying less fuel, and 49% not buying as much food. Younger adults were concerned they could not afford to start a family, with nearly three in ten (29%) 18-29 year olds selecting this option on the survey. It also found that men were more likely than women to ask for a pay rise to counteract cost of living increases. Lifestyle A Pulse survey in May showed that more than 40% of respondents aged 18 to 34 took up new outdoor activities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with 13% of those aged 70 and over. Among the activities proposed in the survey, participants were more likely to take up sea swimming in the West (27%) and Border regions (34%), while hill walking was the most popular activity in the Mid-West (33%), and cycling in the Mid-East (27%). Mental Health More than half of the respondents (55%) to a Pulse survey published in May reported spending more time outdoors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and of those, more than 70% realised that being in natural spaces was important to their well-being and 63% spent more time socialising outside. It found that the three main reasons to spend time outdoors in the previous six months for recreational purposes were: For mental health and well-being (76%); For physical health and exercise (75%); and ‘To get fresh air’ (73%). The majority (87%) of those who lived with a pet who responded to a Pulse survey published in June said it has a positive impact on their mental health and well-being. Crime Fraud crime rose by the highest level, up 43% or by 4,877 to 16,202 incidents in the 12 months to June 2022. Theft & Related offences also rose significantly, up 23% or by 10,559 incidents. However, the number of Homicides fell by 38% between Q2 2021 and Q2 2022, falling from 64 such deaths to 40. This was mainly driven by a fall of 17 (-53%) in Dangerous Driving Leading to Death incidents over this period. Crime detection rates were lower for most crime categories in 2021 when compared with 2020, according to figures published in November. Looking at victims of crime and suspected offenders, in 2021 56% of recorded victims of Sexual offences were aged less than 18 years when the offence occurred. For suspected offenders of sexual violence, 98% were male and 18% were aged under 18 years in 2021. Our Lives Online Digital Consumer Behaviour Our Digital Consumer Behaviour 2022 release published in December found that the most popular online purchase was still clothes, shoes, or accessories at 71%, while the numbers of people ordering ready-made food online rose to 58% in 2022, compared with 50% in 2021. Dubliners were most likely to shop online (87%), followed by persons living in the South-East (84%), while internet users living in the Midland region were the least likely (70%). Household Expenditure on Digital Services In July we learned that Irish households spent €49m on social media and dating sites in 2020, while the total household expenditure on digital services in that year was estimated at €896m. Video streaming services at €211m (24%) was the largest category of paid for digital service followed by online gaming at €137m (15%) and online gambling at €130m (15%). The UK provided more digital services to Irish households than any other country at 34% of the total spend, followed by Ireland at 15%, and The Netherlands at 13%. Information Integrity Despite the increased amount of time we spend online, less than four in ten internet users (37%) read privacy policy statements when providing personal information. Digital Transactions in the Irish Economy In November, we learned that 41% of goods and services produced in the economy were ordered or delivered online, or both, to the tune of €154bn. Some 94% of transactions in the Financial Services sector in 2020 were conducted online, and included transactions such as the provision of insurance, pensions, fund management, and online banking. Our Environment Green Energy CSO figures show the continued growth in the number of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles licensed in Ireland. The number of new electric cars licensed has increased by 82% from 8,414 in the first 11 months of 2021 to 15,291 in the same period in 2022. At the same time, the number of new diesel cars has decreased to 26,889 new diesel cars in the first 11 months of 2022 compared with 34,174 in the same period in 2021. By far the most common type of electric vehicle (EV) in 2021 was the conventional hybrid (45%), while one-third of EV owners had a fully electric EV, and more than one in five (22%) had a plug-in hybrid. However, the most common deterrento buying an EV was the purchase price (63%), 29% cited access to public charging infrastructure, while 21% said that no or limited access to home charging was an issue. Separately, in April we learned that in 2020 energy taxes on petrol were 63 cent per litre compared with 51 cent per litre on autodiesel. Energy Use Looking at electricity consumption by data centres, a release published in May showed it had increased by 32% between 2020 and 2021. The increase between January to March 2015 and October to December 2021 was 265%. A separate release in May also found that large energy users accounted for 23% of metered electricity consumption in 2021. Consumption by large energy users increased by 17% between 2020 and 2021 and by 80% between 2015 and 2021. When it comes to our homes, a detached house in 2021 used 8,039 kWh which was 56% more electricity than an apartment (5,160 kWh). Metered Electricity Consumption data showed that Dublin postal districts had the highest proportion of residential consumption in 2021 at 18%, followed by Cork (12%), Dublin county (7%), Galway (6%) and Kildare (5%). Energy Ratings Data published in September showed that A and B rated dwellings consumed more electricity than F and G rated dwellings in 2021. The lowest mean electricity consumption for F and G-rated dwellings in 2021 may indicate that factors other than energy ratings – such as disposable income, whether the house was adequately heated, and use of secondary heating fuels – may have had an impact. In October, a release showed that more than one-third (36%) of non-domestic buildings constructed between 2020 and 2022 received an A rating compared with 21% built between 2015-2019. The most energy efficient building types audited during 2009-2022 were schools and colleges with 37% awarded an A rating. In October, a release found that electricity was the main space heating fuel used in 84% of domestic dwellings where construction was completed between 2020-2022 and with a Building Energy Rating (BER) audit. Dwellings built between 2015-2019 and between 2020-2022 were considerably more energy efficient than those constructed in earlier periods. Kildare (21%), Dublin County (20%), and Meath (20%) had the highest proportion of A ratings while Leitrim had the lowest at 2%. Emissions In October, the CSO noted that greenhouse gas emissions by resident units fell 17% to 63.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2019 to 2020, mainly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on foreign air travel. However, Environmental Indicators 2022 in November found that Ireland had the second highest emissions of greenhouse gases per capita in the EU27 in 2020 at 11.6 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Rivers and Land Environmental Indicators 2022 also noted that the proportion of rivers and streams in Ireland with high water quality declined from 27% between 1987-1990 to 17% in 2017-2020. Three counties each had more than 10% of the total length of rivers; Donegal (7,867km), Cork (7,584km), and Mayo (7,464km). Dublin, Longford, and Louth had the shortest total length of rivers, Separately, grasslands accounted for almost 56% of the land cover in Ireland, much higher than the EU average of 10%. Donegal was the county with the lowest coverage of grasslands and croplands, at less than 40%, while Meath and Monaghan had more than 90%. Looking at land protection, herbicides were the main type of plant protection product sold in Ireland in 2020. A release published in July showed that total fertiliser sales increased by 6% in 2021 to 1.7 million tonnes, while sales of lime sales increased by 6% in 2021 to 1.7 million tonnes, while sales of lime sales increased by 50% in 2021 to 1.3 million tonnes.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Varadkar predicts tech sector will continue to grow in medium term',\n",
       "  'text': 'The tech sector will continue to grow in the medium term despite job losses being announced last year, the Taoiseach has predicted. In a briefing for political journalists Leo Varadkar said that a “slightly more positive picture” emerged around the sector in the run-in to Christmas after announcements that Meta, Stripe, Twitter, Intel and others had signalled layoffs or temporary furloughing of workers in the autumn. He said after a difficult autumn period there were no “early warnings at the moment of digital job losses”. “The tech sector is downsizing internationally; we’re not going to be immune from that here,” Mr Varadkar said. “A slightly more positive picture (has emerged) perhaps (in) the last few weeks than would have been the case six or 12 weeks ago,” he said, adding that a lot of tech companies were still recruiting. “It’s a situation that we’ll obviously be keeping under review, I’m certain, though, that in the medium to long term we’re going to see further growth in the tech sector. The future is digital. All of those technologies we’re going to see more of in the future, not less,” he said, arguing that Leaving Cert students and school-leavers should strongly consider science, technology, maths and engineering “because there’s going to be more jobs in those areas, not less”. Last month Mr Varadkar conceded that the housing crisis was a “drag” on inward investment, which is regularly raised with him by executives in multinationals during meetings when discussing potential investments in Ireland. Last week The Irish Times reported that officials in inward investment agency IDA Ireland have expressed anxiety about the impact of the housing crisis on big business, saying the lack of accommodation was “not positive” for Ireland. With building commencements slowing down in 2022 despite increased construction targets for 2023, internal records from the State’s inward investment agency show how companies raising housing issues had described an “unfavourable” situation. IDA Ireland ranks among the most powerful public agencies because of links with 1,700 international companies that employ some 300,000 people, which equates to almost 12 per cent of the State’s 2.55 million workforce. “As you can guess IDA’s clients are worried about the housing and in particular the rental situation across the country, and I [would] just like to get an update from you on where you feel our rental policy is at and any new developments,” said one email to the Department of Housing from Tommy Fanning, IDA head of strategic policy.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Many tenants overholding on properties as they can find nowhere else to go',\n",
       "  'text': 'A tenant who had been served an eviction notice for the Co Clare property in which he lived with his family said he had no place to go. Appearing before a tenancy tribunal via Microsoft Teams, the man, who had been accused of overholding by the landlord, said there were “many things wrong” with the house, such as the heating system. The family did not like the dwelling, he said, adding they were not going to stay but “cannot find anywhere” else to live. The tenant was facing a tribunal of three decision-makers in one of the final steps in the dispute-resolution process between landlords and tenants, held by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB). The determination of the tribunal is binding, and can be appealed only on a point of law via the High Court. When a determination order is issued by the tribunal, it can be enforced if a party involved in the case makes an application to the District Court to make the RTB decision a court order. This, barristers working in the sector have said, is not unusual and does happen, though is not required in the majority of cases as most people comply. In the Co Clare case, heard in March 2022, the tribunal determined that the tenant and his family must vacate the dwelling within 28 days of the date of issue of the determination order. There is desperation in many of the cases heard by the tribunals, with the disputes often laying bare the extent of the housing and homelessness crisis. In May 2022, one appellant in Dublin had his appeal heard by a tribunal after he was served an eviction notice. Despite viewing 10 properties, he said he could not find alternative accommodation. The tenant, who was accused of overholding, said he believed he was competing with about 800 other people for each property he attempted to rent. He had two young children who were attending a school near the dwelling, he said, adding that a move to alternative accommodation would involve a change of school which would cause upset to his children. The tribunal determined that the tenant must vacate and give up possession of the dwelling within a 42 days of the date of issue of the determination order. The Irish Times analysed the almost 400 RTB tribunal reports and determination orders that were published in 2022. The reports detailed the disputes arising between tenants and landlords, or, in some cases, third parties who claimed to be affected by a tenancy. According to the RTB’s data, rent arrears and overholding were the most frequent dispute types reported in 2021, accounting for 31 per cent of all complaints made that year. The second most common reason reported was deposit retention (19 per cent of cases), followed by validity of notice of termination (17 per cent of cases) and a breach of landlord obligations (17 per cent of cases). A breakdown of figures for 2022 is awaited. Overholding The issue of overholding frequently results from a fear of becoming homeless, according to the evidence provided by tenants during the tribunals. In another case, heard by the tribunal in March, the tenant’s representative said they were making “every effort to find new accommodation and getting in contact with the correct people but that it had not yet succeeded”. The landlord in the same case said he required the dwelling for his own needs. His children shared a bedroom with him following the breakdown of his marriage, he said, and he had difficulties in terms of mortgage arrears. In Mayo, a tenant who lived in a rented home with her three children said if she was evicted she and her family would be homeless. She told the tribunal in February that she was doing her best and was not overholding deliberately. In April 2022, a couple renting a Dublin home, who had been served a notice of termination, told the tribunal they were in the process of purchasing their own house. They had paid a deposit for the property in February 2021, but “due to the imposition of Covid restrictions, labour shortages and supply issues the construction of the house was delayed” but would be completed in about three months. The tenant said “due to the current housing crisis, when they received the notice of termination, their options were limited and they had to choose between being homeless or overholding”. The couple wanted to move out, he said, but “they were in an impossible situation, and it was difficult to find a short-term solution to their problem”. Sources working in the sector said while overholding is a common dispute type brought to the RTB, it can sometimes be agreed between parties that it is beneficial to take this course of action. In some cases, landlords bring the case to the RTB “out of kindness” as tenants require a determination order to get on various housing support lists, such as social housing or homeless lists, legal sources said. Meanwhile, other tenants stated they accepted and moved into dwellings with insufficient heating, mould or damp, as they had been homeless and just wanted a roof over their heads. sources working in the sector said. Later, these issues became bigger, resulting in some of them having to take a case to the RTB, complaining that their landlords had breached their obligations. Mould and damp were common issues raised by tenants to the tribunal, with at least 17 and nine complaints respectively relating to these concerns. Heating problems also featured regularly, as did broken or damaged furniture or appliances. Ann-Marie O’Reilly, national advocacy manager at Threshold, a charity advocating for rental rights, said it can be quite difficult for a renter to go to a landlord asking for repairs. Heating and boiler repairs are common issues that arise, she added. “There’s a bit of a sense among people who just want to keep their head down. What happens is people don’t say anything and they put up with things that are not okay,” she said, attributing this to the shortage of alternative accommodation options. However, these problems can then worsen as they’ve been left untreated, resulting in a bigger dispute between the two parties. Mary Conway, chairwoman of the Irish Property Owners’ Association, said the current legislation and tax on rental income are the reasons behind landlords leaving the sector Many tenants taking appeals were immigrants, the analysis of the tribunal filings show. Ms O’Reilly said there is potential for migrants to be more vulnerable in this regard, as they may not understand their rights under tenancy laws. “Maybe they’re more likely to challenge things or they don’t have a choice. While it is very difficult to find alternative accommodation for everyone, if you’re not from here and maybe don’t have family or friends with their ear to the ground, maybe you’re left with no choice but to challenge things and hold on to what you have,” she added. One significant change in recent years, Ms O’Reilly said, is the number of cases in which a notice of termination is served because of a landlord’s intention to sell the property. Previously, she said, a lot of these notices would have been deemed invalid. Now, however, the majority of landlords who issue a notice for this reason are found to have a genuine intention to sell. This is reflected in RTB figures, which show 43,000 landlords left the private rental market over the past five years. Adding to this, a quarter of small landlords are likely or very likely to sell their rental properties in the next five years, according to research done by the board. Tom Dunne, chairman of the RTB, recently told a meeting of the Oireachtas housing committee that this shift could be attributed to people who bought properties during the Celtic Tiger, rented them out when they upsized, but have now sold them on as they are no longer in negative equity. However, Mary Conway, chairwoman of the Irish Property Owners’ Association, said the current legislation and tax on rental income are the reasons behind landlords leaving the sector. “For the most part, tenants are absolutely fine. Generally, the reason is the legislation, the RTB and the tax and how long it takes to get in and get things sorted out with regards to overholding,” she said. “Before you actually get to the RTB at all, it could be six months. So you’re already down six months [rent payments] at that stage. I don’t think tenants want to default on their rent. People can fall on hardship.” Under law, if rent arrears arise, a landlord must present the tenant with a written arrears warning notice of a minimum of 28 days. If the arrears are not being paid off during that time, a notice of termination can then be issued, equalling an additional 28 days. If one of the parties decides to then take a case to the RTB, that results in things being delayed further. The average processing time for an initial hearing of a complaint was 19.5 weeks in 2021, while the processing time for tribunals, the next step if the case is appealed, was 33.4 weeks. A spokesman for the RTB said while the body “adapted speedily and implemented changes to processes to maintain services during the pandemic, the impact of Covid-19 inevitably created a backlog of cases”. In 2022, the body has also seen an increase in the volume of applications for dispute resolution, the spokesman said, which will also have an impact on processing times. Most small landlords, 94 per cent, are part-time and do not manage properties as their primary occupation, a 2022 survey by the RTB found. According to Ms Conway, this means margins are small, with many renting out the property only to cover their mortgage. This creates difficult financial situations when tenants stop paying, she said, adding that mortgage arrears become a real concern. Many tenants who fell into rent arrears and who appeared before a tenancy tribunal spoke about falling into financial hardship, with a significant proportion attributing this hardship to job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic. The extent of arrears varied significantly, according to the tribunal reports. Some landlords were owed one month’s rent, while others had accumulated arrears in excess of €25,000. The highest level of arrears recorded in the reports was €60,000. Ms Conway said 99.9 per cent of the time when a tribunal determines that a landlord is due the rent arrears, they do not receive it. She said: “If they didn’t have the money to pay initially, where are they going to get it to backpay? Landlords tend to just accept the losses. How can they pay for it, if they don’t have it?”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Cost of building hundreds of schools soars amid construction inflation',\n",
       "  'text': 'Soaring inflation in the construction sector is making it difficult for contractors to stand over tendered costs for delivering hundreds of school-building projects. Department of Education records show there are more than 300 school building-projects under construction, along with a continuous stream of other projects at or near tendering stage. Internal records released under the Freedom of Information Act flag concerns over project delays and construction inflation linked to the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and “challenging market conditions”. During the first half of last year the Department of Education was forced to increase its basic building costs by 21 per cent based on reviews of actual tender outcomes. This forced the department to seek an additional capital allocation of €300 million during 2022 to meet “significant budgetary pressures” linked to the rising cost of construction, as well as the need to accelerate school accommodation for children with special needs and young people from Ukraine. Of the hundreds of school-construction projects under way they include in excess of 50 new or replacement school buildings and 300 extensions to existing schools, the majority of which are due to be completed by the end of 2023. When asked if projects will be delayed due to rising construction costs and other factors, a spokesman for the department said a €860 million capital allocation in 2023 provided a platform for “strong roll-out” of school-building projects. He said this investment would also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050. “The Department of Education has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school-building programme. There are currently in excess of 300 school-building projects at construction, with other projects in design and at or near the tendering stage.” The spokesman said inflation has created challenges in the construction sector, and the schools sector was no different. “There are central arrangements in place for dealing with inflation which are reflected in the co-operation framework for inflation which was announced by Government earlier this year. This framework provides clarity for contractors when tendering for public works contracts.” He added that the status of all projects were listed on a county by county basis at www.gov.ie. and was updated on a regular basis to reflect their progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction. Special education, meanwhile, was a driver of increased school-construction costs last year. Moves to ensure 900 children with special education needs had access to an appropriate school place required additional investment of €100 million. This was achieved through 83 projects involving mainly modular accommodation. There are also big pressures on the special education front at post-primary level and in large urban centres at primary level, with assessments of needs backlogs and increased evidence of autism. While most Ukrainian pupils are being accommodated within existing schools, the greatest pressure on capacity is at post-primary level where student numbers are rising and there remain significant special needs capacity deficits. A total of €55 million was required for 45 projects at second level to cater to these additional Ukrainian enrolments.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Nearly 700 forestry road licences issued in Ireland',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) has issued an estimated 695 forestry road licences to date, latest figures indicate. Construction of forest roads is exempt from the planning system unless it connects to a public road. According to DAFM, all forest road construction “must be built in a manner that protects water quality and in accordance with the National Council for Forest Research and Development (COFORD) Forest Road Manual (2006) “. This outlines that roadside drainage “must not be allowed to discharge directly into natural watercourses and should be allowed to run out through buffer strips”. All forest road construction projects must secure a licence and the written consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. These regulations apply to the entire forest road project and also govern access to and from public roads. The government is currently in the process of “considering and integrating feedback from stakeholders and the public” following the public consultation on the proposed new €1.3 billion Forestry Programme for 2023-2027. The new programme intends to increase premiums for planting trees by between 46% and 66% and to extend the premium period from 15 to 20 years for farmers. DAFM has outlined that the programme “will cover all costs to establish a forest”, and depending on the type of forest, could pay landowners more than €1,100/ha for up to 20 years. The programme will be 100% exchequer funded but is subject to state-aid approval by the European Commission. According to DAFM, the programme “will come into force in early 2023” once approval is secured from the commission. State aid guidelines in the agricultural and forestry sectors and in rural areas expired on December 31, 2022 and are scheduled to be replaced with a revised version this month. The Irish government cannot submit a formal application for state aid in relation to the new forestry programme until the revised guidelines are in place. Interim forestry scheme Agriculture minister, Charlie McConalogue has confirmed that his department is “engaged” with the commission wich has “facilitated the submission of a pre-notification for this state aid in November ahead of the formal submission for January 2023”. The minister said that DAFM continues to engage bilaterally with the relevant directorate generals in the commission “in order to advance the state aid approval”. In the meantime Minister McConalogue has approved an interim afforestation scheme and an interim forest road scheme based on the De Minimis rule which effectively makes them exempt from state aid rules. In a letter to all registered foresters and other stakeholders, DAFM said that these schemes are being offered to applicants who held “a valid technical approval for afforestation or roads” on December, 31 2022 – but had not commenced work on planting or road construction in 2022, and did not wish to wait until the launch of the Forestry Programme 2023–2027. However the department has stressed that if anyone opts to take part in the interim schemes they will not be permitted to “revert” to the new forestry programme once it is in place. For landowners who may already have a valid technical approval in place for afforestation or a road scheme but who had not commenced work in 2022, they now, according to DAFM, have the option of: Postponing planting or road construction until the launch of the new Forestry Programme 2023-2027 and opting into the new programme;Opting into the interim afforestation/forest road schemes (on the De Minimis basis) with the grants and premiums payable for these schemes outlined in the proposed grants and premiums detailed in the Forestry Programme 2023–2027. However, if someone with a valid approval wants to wait until the launch of new forestry programme, then the department has said they do not have to take any further action at this time.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Construction and Farming sectors account for almost three quarters of all work-related fatalities Provisional data from the Health & Safety Authority (HAS) shows that 26 people lost their lives in work-related incidents in 2022 compared to 38 in 2021, representing the lowest figure recorded since the Authority was established over thirty years ago. Summary of statistics reported by HSA are as follows: Fatal incidents happened to victims from all age groups, the highest number involved people between 55-64 years with 10 fatalities The age groups 55-64 and 65 years and over represents 69% of all fatalities in 2022, with these age groups representing 19% of employees in Ireland (CSO figures up to end of Q3 2022) Falling from height (9 fatalities) and loss of control of a vehicle or its attachments (7 fatalities) were the leading causes of work-related fatalities in 2022 Farming saw 12 fatalities recorded in 2022 compared to 10 in 2021, with it remaining the sector with the highest number of fatalities Dublin, Galway and Wexford recorded the highest level of fatalities with three in each county No fatalities were recorded in 2022 in counties Carlow, Clare, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Leitrim, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Sligo and Wicklow Of the 26 fatalities in 2022, 10 were employees, 13 were self-employed and 3 were non-workers Of the 26 fatalities in 2022, 25 were Male and 1 was Female The transport and storage sector recorded a decline of 83% with one fatality in 2022, compared to six in 2021 Manufacturing recorded no fatalities in 2022, compared to five in 2021 Releasing provisional annual statistics for 2022, the Health and Safety Authority welcomed a decline of over 30% to 26 work-related fatalities in 2022 from 38 in 2021, the lowest figure recorded since the Authority was established. This decline comes against a 3.4% increase in employment figures (Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021). While the confirmed number of work-related fatalities this year is the lowest recorded, it is important to point out that there are ongoing investigations that may see the reported/recorded number of fatalities increase. Commenting on the HSA’s provisional data on fatalities in Irish workplaces, Mark Cullen, Interim Chief Executive at the Health and Safety Authority said, “It is positive to see such a substantial decline in work-related fatalities in 2022. However, our view is that every work-related death is preventable and vigilance around health and safety in Irish workplaces is still imperative. Christmas this year for the families and friends of all those killed in workplace incidents will have been a difficult one and our thoughts are with them”. The HSA reports show that falling from height (9 fatalities) and loss of control of a vehicle or its attachments (7 fatalities) were the leading causes of work-related fatalities in 2022. Mark added: “We see a large number of fatalities relating to working at height and vehicle handling. We also know from the data that the age groups 55 and over represents 69% of all fatalities in 2022, with these age groups representing 19% of employees in Ireland. As Ireland’s labour force is aging, we must all look to our work place practices, and ensure that health and safety is being prioritised across all workforce age groups.” Farming continues to be one of the most dangerous sectors in which to work, and sees an increase with 12 fatalities recorded in 2022 compared to 10 in 2021. “We are urging employers and their workers to think about the task you’re asking others to carry out, or that you are about to undertake. Complete a risk assessment and make sure the right precautions are in place and nobody is putting themselves or others in danger. As evident in our records for 2022, if working with heavy machinery or at a height, be particularly vigilant and take the appropriate care”. In relation to the construction sector which saw a decline in fatalities in 2022, Mark said, “The construction sector saw a decline of 30% with 7 fatalities in 2022 compared to ten in 2021. We welcome this lower number, but are all too aware of this industry being one of the most dangerous. We would ask that smaller sites and contractors in particular continue to ensure that their own and their workers’ safety is a priority every day.” The Health and Safety Authority has guidance and supports available across industry sectors in Ireland and the www.BeSMART.ie tool is freely available to employers and employees.

       "  'title': 'Homelessness record broken again as 11,542 people in emergency accommodation in November',\n",
       "  'text': 'THE NUMBER OF people experiencing homelessness in Ireland has once again hit a record high with latest government figures showing that 11,542 people were living in emergency accommodation in November. It is the fifth consecutive month that the record number has been broken. A total of 5,423 single adults, 1,371 young people and 3,494 children were living in emergency accommodation between 21 and 27 November. It means that 145 more people were living in emergency accommodation in November of last year than the previous month. The figures also represent a 26.85% increase in homelessness compared to the same time period last year. There was also a record high number of young people, aged 18-24, in emergency accommodation in November. Simon Communities of Ireland Executive Director Wayne Stanley said that the government’s decision to introduce a moratorium on evictions over winter was an “important step”, but that unless more secure accommodation can be provided throughout 2023, Ireland may face ongoing extensions and renewals of the eviction ban. Stanley warned that this would not be a “long-term solution”, and added that Ireland needs to see “innovation” in housing provision this year, including driving forward with the focus on rapid build homes. “It is timely to reflect that 11,542 people living in emergency accommodation only a year ago seemed unthinkable,” he said. “2023 needs to be a year of delivery for those at the sharpest end of the ongoing housing crisis or we will see the unthinkable surpassed and redefined each month.” He also called on the government to insert a right to housing into the Irish constitution. ‘Tragedy’ In Dublin, 1,134 families were in emergency accommodation in November, including 2,549 children. The CEO of Dublin Simon Community Catherine Kenny said that they are “dismayed” to see that, for a seventh month in a row, “we have broken the record for the highest number of people ever recorded in homelessness in the capital”. “These spiralling figures convey nothing short of a tragedy,” she added. Kenny further noted that these figures do not include those sleeping rough, staying in domestic violence refuges or the hidden homeless population. She said that it is especially concerning to see an older cohort of people presenting to emergency accommodation services in Dublin. “In the last 12 months, the number of people aged 65 and older entering into emergency accommodation has grown by\\u202f36%. Over the same period, the number of people aged between 45 and 64 entering into emergency accommodation has grown by\\u202f25%. “Their fear is palpable as they try to cope with the stark reality of becoming homeless in older age, and are faced with navigating a very complex system. As we enter into a new year, many will worry what will become of them,” she said. Kenny called on the government to take radical action to tackle the homelessness crisis, adding that it is “simply unacceptable in a first world country with a successful economy”. Focus Ireland CEO Pat Dennigan said that while the charity welcomed commitments to address the homelessness crisis, “we need to see those words turned into urgent action”. “2,706 new build social homes were delivered between January and September 2022, and while final figures for 2022 will not be released until March, Minister O’Brien has said that most newly built social homes were completed towards the end of 2023. “The minister has indicated that last year more social homes were built than for very many years, which would mean that local authorities could be allocating upwards of 3,000 new social homes over the next few months,” he said. Dennigan said that the onus is on the Government to ensure that these homes are allocated in a way that creates a fair balance between the families who have spent years on the waiting list living in unsuitable conditions, and those who are trapped in homelessness, but have not been registered for so long. ‘We can no longer rely on the private sector’ Analysis by Focus Ireland suggests that the current winter eviction ban will have a much more limited impact on homelessness than the Covid-19 eviction ban, which saw figures drop almost 20%. Dennigan explained that this is because during the Covid-19 eviction ban, as well as fewer families becoming homeless, there was an increase in families moving out of homelessness as private rental properties became available on the market. Focus Ireland does not expect that to see an increase in families moving out of homelessness during the winter eviction ban as “we can no longer rely on private sector to provide a route out of homelessness”. Dennigan stressed the importance that this places on new social housing units over the next few months. He also said that it is highly concerning that a large number of families and single families have now been in emergency accommodation for over two years. “This is unacceptable. It’s important to remember that when we discuss these figures we are talking about human beings struggling every day and the trauma of long-term homelessness can leave a lasting trauma long after they finally find a home,” he said. Dennigan said that if the eviction ban is lifted in April, we will face a wave of Spring evictions, “with no emergency accommodation available” for the people affected. He said that the Housing Minister needs to take measures to encourage landlords not to sell up, and that constructive engagement is needed with the over 1,000 landlords who have already issued notice of terminations, and are currently waiting for the eviction ban to lift before they sell up.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Citigroup signs deal for new European HQ in Dublin docklands',\n",
       "  'text': 'Citigroup has signed for a new headquarters in Dublin, in a timely boost for the office market in the capital. The US lender has agreed a €300 million deal for a new office campus in the city’s north docklands. The deal with Johnny Ronan’s RGRE for the delivery of 300,000sq ft (27,870sq m) of office space at the developer’s Waterfront South Central site was concluded in the week leading up to Christmas. Citi is understood to be paying about €100 million to acquire the site with a further €200 million being set aside for the construction of its new base. Due for completion in 2026, the bank’s proposed footprint will equate to roughly 70 per cent of the 430,000sq ft of office accommodation RGRE intends to develop as part of the wider north docklands scheme. News of the agreement should provide something of a fillip for the capital’s commercial property sector coming as it does at a turbulent time for the global tech companies whose requirements have driven much of the demand for office space in the Dublin market over recent years. Facebook’s decision not to occupy the four blocks developed for it by RGRE at its new Ballsbridge campus has, for instance, brought 34,838sq m (375,000sq ft) of office space back to the letting market while LinkedIn’s decision last October to seek an alternative occupier for two blocks under development at its new European headquarters in Wilton Park have added a further 265,000sq ft to the city’s available office stock. Firms took up about 206,000sq m of office space in Dublin during 2022, CBRE said in a statement on Friday. That was an increase of about 35 per cent year on year. Still, it is about two-thirds the amount of space taken up in 2019 before the pandemic struck. It remains to be seen meanwhile, what impact, if any, Salesforce’s announcement earlier this week to cut its global workforce by 10 per cent will have on its office accommodation requirements in Dublin. The company is due to move into its newly developed European headquarters at Spencer Place in the city’s north docklands in March. Developed by RGRE, the campus extends to 40,041sq m (431,000sq ft) and comprises three office buildings along with a 204-bedroom hotel let to Ireland’s largest hotel operator, Dalata Hotel Group. While Salesforce signalled its intention this week to reduce its office footprint globally by setting aside $450 million-$650 million for what it describes as “exit charges associated with office space reductions”, in the case of Dublin, much of the heavy lifting may already have been done. As reported by The Irish Times in December, SMBC Aviation Capital has agreed a deal for all 135,617sq ft of space at Fitzwilliam 28, the newly developed office block which Slack Technologies had signed for in early 2020. That plan was abandoned when Slack was acquired subsequently for €27.7 billion by Salesforce. Slack’s entire operations will now be located at Salesforce’s new European headquarters at Spencer Place.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Glenveagh setback this week may open up opportunity for rival Cairn',\n",
       "  'text': 'Glenveagh Properties, one of the worst performing stocks on the Iseq 20 last year as it lost close to a third of its value, had a stab at a rally in the first days of trading in 2023. It didn’t last long. A trading statement from the home builder on Thursday sent the stock tumbling as much as 10 per cent on the day, as it downgraded its forecast for suburban house completions this year by 20 per cent to about 1,350 units – citing “near-term gridlock” in the planning system at a time when supply is continuing to fall well short of demand in the State and the housing crisis is supposed to be a top Government priority. Back in September, Glenveagh said it had planning in place for 80 per cent of the 1,700 homes it then aimed to complete this year, and that it expected to receive the go-ahead from An Bord Pleanála (ABP) on the remaining 20 per cent during the fourth quarter. None of the anticipated approvals came through. Just days before Christmas, ABP issued an apology for ongoing delays in issuing planning decisions, admitting it was not meeting “statutory objective time frames for decisions for a large number” of cases. The embattled planning body also highlighted that its board, which takes decisions on appeals or applications, was operating with half of its standard complement of 10 members. Glenveagh, led by chief executive Stephen Garvey, used the trading statement to urge planning system reform be “expedited to solve the longer term structural supply issues the sector faces”. The outline of draft legislation published last month has the object of, among other things, recasting ABP under a new name and decision-making structure, and tightening the time frames for judicial reviews of planning decisions, in an effort to avoid projects being bogged down in legal proceedings. The Government aims to enact the planned laws “in early 2023”. But it is no quick fix. While the Government has a target for an average of 33,000 homes to be built every year until 2030, Davy analyst Conall Mac Coille estimates house completions will actually fall this year to 27,000 from 28,400 in 2022. Glenveagh has long set its sights on becoming the biggest housebuilder in the State, and to be churning out 3,000 homes by 2024. Peer Cairn’s aim is to deliver 5,000-5,500 homes in the three years to 2024, which, when factoring in the 1,500 units factored in for last year, points to a more manageable average of 1,750-2,000 for this year and next. Some 2,000 of Glenveagh’s 2024 target is forecast to come from building houses, mainly in the Dublin commuter belt, with the rest coming from building urban apartments for investment firms involved in the private rental sector (PRS) and a new line of business developing social and affordable units in partnership with local authorities and State agencies. Glenveagh has enough to be getting on with, for now, on the urban front – having agreed forward funding deals last year to develop projects in the Citywest, Castleknock, Blackrock and north docklands areas of Dublin, totalling more than €310 million. However, this line of business has become increasingly challenged over the past six months, as overseas money that flooded into the sector in recent years – including German and Dutch pension funds – has all but dried up since the European Central Bank (ECB) started to jack up interest rates. “There is a real viability issue in PRS at the moment,” said Colin Sheridan, an analyst with Davy. “Buyers that were in the market in recent years were buying at rental yields of as low as 3.6 per cent in prime areas... Even if PRS investors come back to the market, they’ll be demanding higher yields than they previously had accepted.” Jonathan Coubrough, an analyst with London brokerage Numis, noted to clients that Glenveagh was struggling to scale up its business as quickly as it would have liked. “We see further timing risk here,” he said, reiterating his reduce recommendation – the equivalent of a sell – on the stock. Barclays analyst Celine Soo-Huynh was more upbeat, saying “fundamentals are expected to remain resilient” this year, with house price inflation expected to amount to 6 per cent, while construction cost inflation, which had hit the construction sector hard last year, should also ease. Irish lenders have largely lagged behind European peers in passing on ECB rate hikes. “The 30 per cent presale on the units completing in 2023 is lower than the year prior, but management expects the recent announcements by the [Central] Bank of Ireland on less restrictive mortgage requirements, as well as a supportive Irish housing policy, to still fuel demand for new homes,” she said. This time last year, Glenveagh had already signed up buyers for almost 45 per cent of the owner occupier homes it ended up completing last year. Some believe that Cairn – which had a head start on accumulating its land bank following the crash and floating on the stock market – should break away from its arch-rival in the eyes of investors. Shares in Cairn, trading at 91 cent in Dublin on Friday afternoon, and Glenveagh, changing hands at under 87c, are well below their respective €1 initial public offering prices. Could a scheduled trading statement from Cairn on Monday morning be a catalyst? “Cairn is in a more advantageous position from a planning perspective – with 90 per cent of its guided unit volumes to 2024 having full planning permission,” said Shane Carberry, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers. The overriding ambition of both housebuilders is to deliver profit returns by 2024 that are the equivalent of 15 per cent of shareholders’ equity. Glenveagh has more work to do, with its estimated return on equity last year of 7 per cent below Cairn’s 11 per cent target. Glenveagh has been relying more heavily on share buy-backs and to get there, having repurchased and cancelled close to €254 million of its stock over the past years (helped by money received from the forward sale of apartment schemes). It announced on Thursday that it planned to repurchase a further 10 per cent of its stock – which equates to €55 million based on its current share price. More buy-backs may be in store if it fails to deliver on hitting ambitious building targets.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Immunologist says stronger advice on mask-wearing needed amid surge in respiratory viruses',\n",
       "  'text': 'AN IMMUNOLOGIST HAS said that the Government “missed a trick” by not strongly advising the public of the importance of wearing masks before the current winter surge that is seeing record hospital overcrowding due to a rise in respiratory illnesses. Professor Christine Loscher told The Journal that while the current public health advice doesn’t need to be changed, there needs to be more communication on the effectiveness of mask-wearing in preventing the spread of Covid-19 and influenza. The health service is coming under an increasing amount of pressure at the moment due to the number of patients presenting with respiratory viruses. While Covid and RSV are significant factors, officials have singled out influenza as being of particular concern, with cases increasing rapidly and no clear indication of when they might peak. On Tuesday, a record 931 patients were without beds in Irish hospitals, the highest figure ever recorded by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO). While that figure has reduced in recent days, the interim CEO of the HSE, Stephen Mulvany, has said that despite this week being the worst on record for hospital overcrowding, he cannot say for certain that “it won’t get worse before it gets better”. Mask wearing Speaking to The Journal, Dr Christine Loscher said: “I think that we missed a trick in that we should have been getting the public on board with the fact that when things surge, we could do something to help the situation, and that this is what we should have been doing all along.” “Now we’re not just dealing with Covid, but we’re dealing with RSV and the flu,” she said, adding that she doesn’t know whether the public “are as on board as we need them to be” with the public health advice because of a lack of messaging and not being used to following the advice since restrictions were lifted. “We have evidence from the last couple of winters that when we do behave differently, we also impact on those viruses. There needs to be very strong advice that we should wear masks on public transport and in crowded indoor, poorly ventilated spaces at the moment, in order to reduce everyone’s risk.” Currently, the public health advice on mask-wearing is that while they are no longer mandatory, masks are still advised on public transport and in healthcare settings such as hospitals and GP surgeries. Call for mask mandate But last week, the INMO called on the Government to “make difficult decisions including the return of mandated mask-wearing in congregated settings” in an effort to reduce the spread of respiratory infections. “We know that one of the main pressure points in our health service is the rise of respiratory infections. Asking people to return to mask-wearing in busy congregated settings is a simple measure,” Phil Ní Sheaghdha, general secretary of the INMO, said. However, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly has said that the official advice to Government is that mask mandates are not required. “I don’t anticipate any change coming in terms of the public health advice from the Chief Medical Officer,” Donnelly said. “However, I want to fully acknowledge the INMO’s concerns, I think they are playing a very constructive role. I got a letter in from them today, we had a good chat earlier on today. They’re looking for solutions,” Donnelly said. “The public health advice to Government, to me at the moment, it is not a move to mask mandates, but obviously we will keep the situation under review on a daily and on a weekly basis.” Loscher is not in favour of introducing a mask mandate, and believes that issuing stronger advice is the way to go. “We’ve missed the boat on forming that habit, now we’re in dire straits and we need people to respond. I can totally understand the INMO calling for a mandate because they’re the frontline dealing with the desperate situation that everyone’s in at the moment,” she said. “Mandates come with controversy; it ends up being huge discussions, whereas I think that it needs to be, again, reiterating the benefits to people of infection control using masks, hand washing and sanitising.” At a briefing on Tuesday, the Government said flu cases are much higher than in previous years, with the number of people being hospitalised more than doubled compared to pre-Covid. Flu vaccines Compared to 2019, there were 2,331 lab confirmed cases of flu identified up to Christmas week. This is in contrast to 1,000 cases in 2019. Of the 2,331 cases, a total of 637 people hospitalised which compared to 350 people on past figures. Loscher said the current flu season still hasn’t peaked and that there’s “still an awful lot of people out there who will get the flu”. There is no doubt that when we were wearing masks in the context of Covid, that it did have a huge impact in terms of the incidence of things like flu and other respiratory viruses. She previously told The Journal that she would have liked to have seen flu vaccines free for everyone the way they were in the last few years. The vaccine is currently free for people aged 65 and over, children aged 2-17, healthcare workers and people with long-term health conditions. She said that by making the flu vaccine free for all age cohorts, it is likely to improve the uptake of the vaccine and reduce the spread of the virus. “If you want people to behave a certain way, you’ve got to make it easy for them. When you put barriers in the way like increased costs, I think it really impacts on people engaging with them anymore,” she said. Attitude towards masks While more people have been visibly wearing face masks on public transport and in crowded settings in recent weeks, the vast majority of people are not wearing one. Pete Lunn, the head of behavioural research at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), told The Journal that it is unlikely that there will be a significant increase in mask-wearing under the current guidance. “When the mandate was lifted for masks on public transport and in some other public settings, there was a very rapid fall-off in people wearing them. There is a very big difference between having a rule and something being guidance, however strong that guidance is,” Lunn said. “Part of the reason for this is that because mask-wearing is very much a collective activity, people tend to do it much more when they see that other people are doing it too. The existence of a rule really, really drives up the proportion of people who are wearing masks. And when you take the rule away, even if it remains guidance, as soon as people see that some other people aren’t doing it, the numbers doing it drop. From a behavioural science point of view, essentially you move from an equilibrium where people are cooperating with each other because they can see other people are doing it – to a situation where because a lot of people aren’t doing it, the people who would cooperate don’t, because they can’t see why they should bother if other people aren’t bothering. “You end up with a minority doing it, who are the ones who are perhaps most at risk or ones that believe in it most, or whatever it happens to be, but you get a really big change. “If I’m honest, I think it would be very difficult to get mask-wearing back up to a high level again purely through voluntary guidance. Ultimately, it’s going to take a decision to say: ‘Look, there is a mandate in these circumstances, this is what everyone has to do.’” Lunn said that were a mask mandate to be introduced, it is difficult to know what the public response would be. “In the past, whenever we’ve introduced genuine rules about this, the very large majority of people stuck to it,” he said. “I think it’s pretty clear to everyone at this stage that we have a problem. Given what they’re seeing on the news and given the way people have responded in the past to pressure on the hospitals and rises in case numbers, I would anticipate that if we strengthen the rules surrounding wearing masks, that more people will wear them and we’ll get pretty high compliance, but I can’t be sure about that.” Loscher said that while it is possible that people may not resume wearing masks at the level previously seen, a strong message from Government could still see an increase in the number of people following the public health advice. “One way of changing behaviour is to make it mandatory. We all know that when people have to comply, they will. I think the reason that maybe the uptake on mask wearing won’t be as much as it could have been, is because this is what we should have been doing over the last few cycles of Covid so that people are used to: ‘This is what we do when we get a surge and the healthcare sector is impacted’,” she said. “I do think there’s lots of very small things that we can do, and that will help, but I think it’s about the Government and the HSE coming out and asking people to help support the healthcare sector and the healthcare workers at the moment by doing that range of things where they can. That message is very strong, and I think that’s a message that people respond to very well.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Increase in online shopping prompts spike in demand for warehouse space in Limerick',\n",
       "  'text': 'AN INCREASE in online shopping has resulted in a spike in demand for warehousing space in Limerick. That\\'s according to two leading city auctioneers, who have expressed positivity in the commercial sector as the local and national economy recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic last year. Tom Crosse, GVM Auctioneers and Gordon Kearney, Rooney Auctioneers, have also reported that despite another impact of the coronavirus lockdown - that of working from home - demand for office space in the city remains high. Mr Crosse, who trades in Glentworth Street in the city, said: \"The warehousing market has been the big winner with all historically vacant units now occupied with new suitors either as purchase or investors.\" The demand for this type of space is not just because of a rise in online shopping, but also substantial price increases in Dublin, and the comparative lack of warehousing stock in the regions, he added. [articlepreview id=\"1004814\" link=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/1004814/have-property-prices-peaked-limerick-estate-agents-reflect-on-2022-and-look-at-the-year-ahead.html\"] Contributing to this, Mr Kearney said: \"There has been extremely low levels of construction of new warehouse and industrial space resulting in existing stock being in high demand with competitive biddings on most sales throughout the year.\" One thing which has impacted across the board when it comes to property, both residential and commercial, has been the rise in construction costs - both labour and materials. Mr Kearney, whose auctioneering firm is located in the city centre\\'s O\\'Connell Street, said it led to demand for development land dropping last year. But sales of commercial interest properties were very active in the first six months of 2022, something he puts down to negative interest rates being applied to large deposits held in banks. \"Large depositors sought a better return on their deposits and invested heavily in commercial investment properties and land,\" he explained. \"However, since positive interest rates have now returned, activity levels on commercial investment properties have waned somewhat.\" Mr Crosse says there has been a \"very robust\" local commercial market this year, with rental for office space up around 10% year-on-year. \"Rental levels in business parks is ranging from €15 to €20 per square foot with good grade A space in the city centre averaging €25 per square foot. “There appears to be growing interest in the good quality accommodation,\" he added. [articlepreview id=\"1004917\" link=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/1004917/limerick-people-urged-to-run-or-walk-to-support-work-of-milford-care-centre.html\"] In terms of commercial sales, GVM notably sold development sites in Kildare town centre - which will be used for a school - and land for a shopping arcade in Tullamore, Co Offaly. In October last, the flagship tenant at the city\\'s Opera Centre development, Revenue, admitted it would be reconsidering the number of people it planned to work at the heart of the space due to the rise in the number of people working-from-home. It sparked fears given Revenue\\'s importance to the massive public project. Mr Kearney pointed out that a number of Rooney\\'s clients who had discussed fears of having \"superfluous\" office accommodation were, however, beginning to change tack. \"[They] are now informing us that they expect a return to office policy implemented in 2023 and therefore they will no longer have superfluous office space,\" Mr Kearney concluded.',\n",

Ireland’s medicines shortage is getting worse as its health system struggles to cope with a wave of winter infection, according to a new analysis. The number of products unavailable to Irish doctors and pharmacies to treat patients has jumped by more than 15 per cent over the past month. Dominic Coyle has the details. More than 1,000 Irish businesses could go to the wall this year, costing creditors and others €3 billion-€4 billion, a report published on Monday warns. Between one and two businesses fail every day in the Republic, according to some calculations. However, a new PwC report warns that this could rise to more than 1,000 – almost three daily – this year, as the global recession bites more deeply in coming months. Barry O’Halloran reports. Emma Jacobs says it is time we culled the amount of meetings we have to attend. Building slowed at its fastest rate since the summer last month as inflation continued to hit the industry, writes Barry O’Halloran. The latest construction survey shows that building slowed for the third month running in December, with rising costs hitting demand.

       "  'title': 'Housebuilding activity contracts sharply for third month running',\n",
       "  'text': '“2022 was a year of two halves for construction,” said BNP Paribas Real Estate Ireland director and head of research, John McCartney. “Strong expansion between January and May gave way to slowing activity from June, and the year petered out with a further pronounced slowdown in December,” he said. The construction sector is in contraction territory due to “challenging economic conditions” which have hit market demand. The headwinds facing the industry include, supply chain delays, and high input prices. The fall in construction activity coincided with a reduction in new orders. New business decreased for the ninth consecutive month, and to the greatest extent since last August. This falling workload led firms to reduce staffing levels. Mr McCartney said: They initially took a wait-and-see approach to shrinking order books, maintaining their staff headcounts and continuing to purchase materials. “But after nine months of new business contraction, panelists have now begun running down stocks and not replacing employees who leave.” The survey recorded a drop in activity across the three construction categories, housing, commercial, and civil engineering. The softest fall in activity was seen on commercial projects, despite the rate of decline quickening from November. Some construction firms remain optimistic and have predicted a rise in development activity for 2023 as many expect the current economic environment to become less volatile. Mr McCartney said: Ireland’s construction firms retain a positive medium-term outlook, with a solid majority expecting to be busier this time next year. “This may reflect recent developments which should assist with current viability challenges. “Input price inflation has moderated to its slowest rate for 21 months,” he said. Mr McCartney also said the State’s Croí Cónaithe scheme will also help increase building activity as it is being implemented to subsidise apartment developments that would otherwise not be profitable to build. However, he said further government action is required if construction activity is to increase. “Relaxing mortgage restrictions and raising the shared equity scheme price ceilings, may also underpin builders’ confidence that they will be able to sell properties at prices that make development viable,” Mr McCartney said.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Taoiseach Leo Varadkar &amp;lsquo;will do all it takes, leaving no stone unturned&amp;rsquo; to end housing emergency – except touch the €5bn surplus',\n",
       "  'text': 'To put it in Michael Noonan-style parlance: the house is on fire but the lads are wondering how much use they’d get out of a hose the next day. Heartiest congratulations to the Department of Housing and all the local authorities around the country for their fiscal management this year. The gratitude of the nation too must go to 3,494 children who were homeless this Christmas for their contribution to this prudence. There was €66,000 for each one of them just sitting in the bank to build houses that never got spent. In a year when President Michael D Higgins declared a “housing disaster”, with record numbers of people in homelessness, €231m set aside for building houses went unspent. Homes, in other words, for people who are without a place to live. And that’s not an error. It’s not that there was an overspend on housing last year, when the challenges of record rent rises and 70,000 Ukrainian refugees were added into the equation. 2022 was quite the year. Remarkably, the housing budget still came in under the limit. And the kids who went homeless for Christmas because not enough houses were built – helped round up the Exchequer figures and bring in a budget surplus of €5bn. After all, a housing overspend would not have looked good on the balance sheet.And that’s what is important. The interchangeable finance ministers Michael McGrath and Paschal Donohoe were grinning away at their figures last week. The Coalition’s answer to the Kray twins are busy hoarding a pot of gold for a rainy day. The largesse of the Covid era is gone.Coming into 2023, real-world figures show a record 11,500 accommodated by homeless services near the end of 2022 – up over 25pc on the same period a year earlier. Renewed Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says there are a number of pressing challenges that will define the rest of this Government’s term in office: “The first is housing.” He says the Government “must apply the same spirit of determination, action and immediacy that we saw during the pandemic to this the greatest challenge of today”.“We must do whatever it takes it solve this social crisis and reverse the trend of rising homelessness and falling homeownership. We will leave no stone unturned. No option taken off the table without due consideration,” he declared on becoming Taoiseach.This has become something of a slogan as he trotted out the same line this week when he met with a housing policy quango during the week. Due to a mix-up, Housing Minister Darragh O’Brien was curiously absent from his meeting with the Housing Commission. Varadkar has come on a bit since having a dispute with Micheál Martin around the Cabinet table about whether housing was the most important issue and whether it preceded protecting the economy. Now Varadkar is poetically promising “hope and housing”.But to “do whatever it takes” clearly doesn’t include telling councils they can go above their allocated budgets to deliver on housing targets at a time of unprecedented demand when unforeseen events occur.The fear of getting a rap across the knuckles from the department seems to outweigh any desire to “do whatever it takes”. It’s doubtful the Dáil Public Accounts Committee is going to haul a local authority chief executive across the coals for going a few million over budget in order to “do whatever it takes” to deliver houses.The warnings were there in the summer of a problem as spending was too slow. A euro in every five that was supposed to have been spent wasn’t. The blame at that point was being placed on “lower than anticipated spend on Local Authority housing due to ongoing economic issues impacting delivery” and on “wider challenges in the construction sector, including supply chain disruption”. The alarm bells were ringing loud.Come the end of the year and Donohoe is explaining that the “very high levels of inflation” had an impact on the delivery of new houses and the ability of local authorities to manage their budgets. The focus though has to be on the spending of every euro. “What myself and Minister Darragh O’Brien are aware of is the need to spend and spend well,” the public expenditure minister says.Inflation does drive prices up, making budgets harder to manage. Contracts have to be renegotiated and tenders put out again. Normally this would result in an overspend, but instead there was an underspend. The local authorities couldn’t get the housing across the line due to a shortage of manpower and supplies.But it also appears the pressure from red tape as costs increased and being afraid to go over budget, meant projects were stalled. Rather than logically going over budget – in the very year where it was most excusable – spending got postponed for another day. It was easier than getting caught over budget.During Covid-19, the coffers were thrown open, but now in the housing crisis we’re talking about watching every cent. So much for applying “the same spirit of determination, action and immediacy that we saw during the pandemic”. Nobody is suggesting the Government start burning money, but there has to be some acknowledgement that construction prices are gone up and the bang for the buck will be lessened.The slowdown in building starts is having knock-on effect for 2023 with O’Brien now admitting it will be a struggle to hit targets again this year. The excuses are already being lined up. The cycle continues. It’s not about a lack of investment. The capital spending on housing is the highest of any area of government, trumping even transport, and is at record levels. At a time when unprecedented resources are available, the Coalition literally can’t spend the money. Varadkar’s argument that delivery on housing will be the test of this Government’s success until the general election is correct. Reform of the health service, the cost of living, climate action and a potential recession shouldn’t go without a mention. The next election though will be about housing and who can show they have the solutions. Not being able to spend the funding allocated is hardly a ringing endorsement of Coalition policy.Putting out the fire can’t wait.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Fish producers welcome change to permit scheme for migrants',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Irish Fish Producers Organisation (IFPO) has welcomed the new permit scheme which will give non-EEA migrant fishers the same rights as EU crew members. IFPO chief executive, Aodh O Donnell says their members lobbied for the change and are delighted it has now finally come into effect. O Donnell says this employment permit system also offers a more streamlined process to crew members and vessel owners alike. The Department of Justice confirmed the new arrangements this week. Under the new scheme, all holders of a current valid permission to work as a non-EEA Crew member under the Atypical Working Scheme (AWS) in the Irish Fishing Fleet expiring on or after 1 January 2023 will be granted a Stamp 4 immigration permission. The new arrangements provide for legislative changes for non-EEA Crew in the Irish Fishing Fleet and to assist in the transition period to the Employment Permit system. O Donnell says this award of Stamp 4 permission is a “critical and much embraced change to the status of Crew employed in the Irish Fishing Fleet under the auspices of the problematic Atypical Working Scheme.” “Our members have worked hard with us, as a representative body, to support the right of all non-EEA migrant fishers to fair treatment and for fit for purpose permitting. This is positive news with the introduction of measures to protect migrant fishers and to grant them the full rights and entitlements under Employment legislation. This legislative change gives qualifying non-EEA crew the same full entitlements as EU crew and the option to avail of the share-based remuneration. Furthermore, the process of permitting is streamlined for both crew and vessel owners. Costs of administration are also radically reduced to the benefit of all stakeholders.” “In this regard we highly commend Minsters Charlie Mc McConalogue at the Department of Agriculture Food, and Marine and Damien English at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. They must be credited for sound leadership and for spearheading this much needed legislative initiative. In addition, we should point out that the seafood sector worked together and engaged proactively with the various government departments over the last year to deliver this outcome. The cooperation and support of the Civil Service is a paradigm for what can be achieved in the process of open, focused, and constructive engagement.” Niall Connolly Chairman of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation adds that ‘’we have been consistent in saying that our crews are the backbone of the traditional fishing activity. Ours is a professionally operated sector, committed to international best practice. These employees have valuable skill sets that are critical to our business and are much prized. We have shared goals, and we strive for continuity and international best practice’’. Barry Faulkner, Director of the Irish Fish Producers Organisation also acknowledged the support of the Minister for Marine and the delivery of an undertaking at a Protest meeting held in Kildare Stret on May 18th last year. ‘’Our vessel owners were joined in solidarity with our migrant crew colleagues to support them in a protest at Leinster House. This initiative was led by crew and skippers alike and aimed to raise awareness of much-needed legislative change to current permit schemes. The protest meeting was addressed by Minister Mc McConalogue. Whilst there are some technical implementation considerations, the Minister has delivered on an undertaking given to vessel owners and crew on that day’’. Aodh O Donnell says the “partnership with the crew members underpins the performance of our vessels to ensure a shared long-term future in a challenging international environment. This fit for purpose permit scheme is a key element of this universally welcomed change’’.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Shoppers must demand longer lasting goods and less packaging, says Fine Gael waste policy paper',\n",
       "  'text': 'Shoppers must be able to buy longer-lasting appliances and have packaging-free areas in supermarkets, a Fine Gael policy document says. The ‘circular economy’ paper also says the construction industry must improve sorting of demolition and building site waste so that materials can be reused.It urges immediate action to prevent the €700 in food waste clocked up by the average household in a year.The document comes from Fine Gael’s ‘Policy Lab’, an internal think-tank of party members and external experts.A survey conducted by the group found most people believed making changes in the goods they bought and how they used them would be difficult.Most of those quizzed had confidence they could find ways to reduce their food waste to zero and a narrow majority felt they could avoid fast fashion.But a minority felt it would be manageable for them to stop using disposable containers, avoid single use plastic, reduce their black bin waste to zero or achieve high energy efficiency in their home.Only small numbers felt they could easily downsize their home reduce energy and running costs and an even smaller proportion felt it would be possible to forgo car ownership in return for a local vehicle sharing scheme.Respondents reported poor options in their local area for the repair or upcycling of consumer goods.By contrast, two-thirds said recycling facilities were good or very good in their area but as recycling rates are not improving, that raises questions as to why those facilities are not being used more.The document, which echoes Green Party policies, comes as Green Minister for the Circular Economy, Oisín Smyth, works on drawing up waste reduction, recycling and reusability targets for business and industry.Most sectors have a mountain to climb.The construction industry in Ireland produces 9 million tonnes of waste per year and has a recycling rate of just 10pc.Around 170,000 tonnes of clothes are thrown out each year here and only 35pc get recycled.Packaging waste remains a major issue too but Richard Bruton, chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, said it was one of the ‘low-hanging fruits’ that government and consumers could tackle.He urged adoption of the model in France where large supermarkets had to dedicate a quarter of their space to unpackaged food items that shoppers could take home in their own reusable containers.He said government should work with businesses to encourage change first but mandatory measures might be needed later on.“You need to promote innovation in the first place but over time you will see these practices that are proven doable embedded in regulation.“You don’t start with the big gun of regulation, which may be inflexible. You start to create the incentives and you set the targets.”The paper calls for development of a ‘national innovation hub’ to build in sustainability at the design stage of goods, and the creation of a system of ‘marks of best practice’ to recognise sustainability in manufacturing.It urges the development of ‘sustainability networks’ to support community repair and upcycling services and it says government must use its influence in public procurement contracts to ensure the most sustainable goods and services were paid for with public money.Mr Bruton said the policy document was not an attempt to muscle in on the Green Party but to help Minister Smyth decide his targets.“This is a concept whose time has come. Hats off to the Greens who perhaps identified that before others but it’s something we definitely need to do now, and we are fully shoulder to the wheel to make this effective,” he said.',\n",

       "  'title': 'From increased spending to tax breaks, can the ideas discussed at summit fix the housing crisis?',\n",
       "  'text': 'Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he wants 2023 to be a “year of inflection” in the housing crisis – having called a housing summit today as a “point of reflection”. But what are the ideas discussed today, can they work, and if so, how quickly? Viability This seems to have been the biggest focus of the day. Sources at the meeting said that there was a major push from some of the property and development companies there to overhaul some Government schemes aimed at making stranded apartment blocks viable. Largely because of changed financing conditions and higher interest rates, some builders cannot complete units with planning permission because the financial models underpinning them no longer stack up. They’re asking for subsidised funding to kick in at the start of the development process, rather than the end, with two of Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien’s flagship schemes, Croí Cónaithe Cities and Project Tosaigh, in their sites. Afterwards, Varadkar also spoke about purchasing large quantities of homes in advance, guaranteeing a certain price for a percentage of a development and hence “derisking” it. With a shortfall in housing commencements, the aim is to convert permissions into units in 2024, when the drop-off is predicted to bite. Spending more There is obviously a relationship between the money available for housing and the level of outputs – O’Brien consistently points to significantly bigger capital budgets for housing compared with previous years, and how the Coalition is recovering from a decade of underinvestment (although the Minister insisted today this isn’t a dig at his Coalition partners). Varadkar today insisted there was no barriers to spending growing “so long as the economy is strong and so long as the public finances can support it”. “Of course we’re willing and want to spend more money resolving the housing crisis.” However, it’s not that straightforward. As the Department of Finance has previously flagged, there are constraints in the economy around sourcing enough workers, materials and the capacity of the planning system which can’t be solved with fistfuls of cash. Sourcing more workers Since 2019, rules governing trades like bricklayer and plasterer have been relaxed – removed from the list of occupations ineligible for employment permits. Many construction sector workers from outside the European Economic Area are eligible for a general employment permit. However, the Economic and Social Research Institute has called for construction trades such as carpentry and plumbing to be added to the State’s critical skills list. There is also an upturn in the number of people taking up apprenticeships, but the legacy of the crash, which tarnished the sector for a generation of young people and saw many tradespeople emigrate, still has a big impact here. The Taoiseach said today that Ireland is facing this challenge at the same time many other countries are competing for skilled labour, meaning the country may struggle to attract people in, no matter what reforms are adopted. Emergency homeless measures The eviction ban hasn’t been successful in stemming the flow of people into homelessness – at least not yet – with record figures released before Christmas. It is due to expire at the end of March – leading to fears that whatever impact it is having on suppressing new homelessness will evaporate and make the situation worse. O’Brien has been slow to call for an extension, mindful that doing anything seen to force small landlords from the market will not help his cause. Varadkar confirmed it was discussed at today’s summit, but he conceded there wasn’t unanimity on the issue. Other steps discussed today included prioritising people in emergency accommodation for social housing, but the Taoiseach again said some had warned of the “negative consequences of unintended consequences” arising from such a step. Expanding measures for renters Budget 2023 saw the introduction of an annual €500 in tax relief for renters. The measure does little to solve the underlying problems in the rental market but it does address, to an extent, some of the affordability issues renters face, even if it is not the step change they need. Politically, it’s seen as a bulwark against losing more and more younger voters, so more measures like this, or an enhanced version, could prove politically popular. Tax breaks Probably the most politically contentious, if only because the Opposition will salivate at the prospect of attacking a Fianna Fáil Housing Minister for introducing tax breaks to encourage property development. Nonetheless, it was discussed today, the Taoiseach saying that “nothing is off the table”. O’Brien has been guarded in his public comments, but behind the scenes proposals have been under development for some time. The theory goes that Michael McGrath may be more open to the idea than his predecessor in the finance brief, Paschal Donohoe. Targeted tax breaks for apartment development in urban areas, capital allowance tax reliefs or a cut in VAT are all under consideration, as are tax breaks for smaller landlords to encourage them to stay in the market.',\n",

A total of 19,660 new jobs were created by Enterprise Ireland client companies in 2022. The jobs growth translates into a net increase of 10,841 jobs created last year. Employment increased across Enterprise Ireland’s three core economic sectors – technology & services (up 8% on 2021), industrial and life sciences (up 5%) and food and sustainability (up 3%). Strong employment growth was reported in specific sub sectors such as climate, sustainability and agritech (up 13%); digital technology (up 9%); high tech construction and housing (up 6%); fintech, financial & business services (up 6%); the life sciences and engineering sectors both saw 5% employment growth. “A real positive of today’s results is the regional balance in terms of both new jobs created and total employment,” said Minister for Enterprise, Trade & Employment, Simon Coveney. “More than 147,000 people in the regions are now employed by Enterprise Ireland client companies, making an enormous contribution to local economies and communities. “The government’s target to have a record 2.5 million people employed by 2024 has already been exceeded. Enterprise Ireland has also exceeded its own employment target for 2022 with these results announced today. “I firmly believe that with a strong focus on innovation, digitalisation, sustainability and regional development, Enterprise Ireland will continue to enhance their significant contribution to growing and maintaining quality jobs in every region and county in Ireland.” Enterprise Ireland CEO Leo Clancy said: “Enterprise Ireland supported companies like Version 1 play a vital role in the Irish economy, employing more than 218,000 people in cities, towns and villages throughout the country and making an enormous contribution to local economies. “Supporting Irish-owned companies to achieve greater scale and expand their global footprint is a priority for Enterprise Ireland in 2023 and we are committed to supporting Irish companies on their journey to become global leaders in their field.

       "  'text': 'Engineering consultancy EDC, which celebrates 20 years in business this year, has announced the opening of a new Galway office. Gerard Kirwan, Associate Director at EDC, will head up this new office located. The addition of this office will bring EDC’s Irish presence to four Irish offices for the company, complementing their international offices in London and Istanbul. Over the past two years, EDC has experienced impressive growth, expanding its team to one hundred people across six offices in Cork, Dublin, Limerick, London, Istanbul, and most recently, Galway. This growth is reflected in EDC’s increased market share in the UK and Ireland, with staff numbers doubling from the start of 2021 to the end of 2022. EDC estimates that this trend will continue, with an additional 25% increase in staff numbers by the end of 2023 to support the investment and growth in market share. In August 2022, the firm announced the opening of a new office in Istanbul, Turkey, expanding the company’s presence in the MENAT region to accommodate client demand and leverage opportunities within these regions. The Istanbul team continues to grow, allowing them to provide best-in-class MEP Design and BIM services in the region; and to facilitate growth, they have moved to larger premises to facilitate doubling the size of the Istanbul team over the coming 12 – 18 months. Commenting on the opening of the Galway office and the company’s continued growth, Richard O’Farrell, Managing Director of EDC, said “As EDC celebrates 20 years in business in 2023, this expansion into Galway is another exciting step forward for the company, and sets the foundation for future growth across Ireland and beyond.

       "  'title': 'Minister Harris gives go-ahead for next phase of proposed capital investment for TU Dublin - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris has today announced that Technological University Dublin (TUD) has been given the go-ahead to proceed to the next phase of the project proposal development for a ‘Design & Construct’ Sustainable Building Centre on their Broombridge Campus. The project envisages the refurbishment of a building in TU Dublin’s satellite facility in Broombridge in order to utilise it for core academic space to address capacity. It is anticipated that the proposed state-of-the-art campus would build capacity for the greater Dublin Area and beyond. Minister Harris confirmed that TU Dublin has been successful under the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund (TSSPF) and is now approved to proceed to develop the preliminary business case for a multi-disciplinary teaching and learning facility at Broombridge. It is envisaged that the new building will serve students in the areas of Architecture, Engineering and Construction. Speaking today, Minister Harris said: “Today is a key milestone as we see TU Dublin emerge from the first part of a robust strategic assessment process, and move to the next phase of the project life cycle development, which will see the development of preliminary business case. “This proposed new building would accommodate 1,400 new learners in key skills demand such as retrofit, low carbon technologies, Modern Methods of Construction (MMC), and in energy efficiency. “It is anticipated that its creation would be a Beacon for Sustainability and Climate Action, creating a Retrofit hub in one of the largest residential areas requiring retrofit in the city. “Investment will play an important role in supporting the technological sector as drivers of regional development by allowing them to better meet the needs of learners in their region, to deepen existing and forge new relationships with business and enterprise and to respond in an agile fashion to future developments. “The HEA in advancing these capital proposals, is playing a crucial leading role in rolling out the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund ensuring a pipeline of key strategic projects delivers for our learner, economic and societal needs, and we need to keep these objectives at the heart of all our decision making. The outcomes of the preliminary business case stage will inform the development of a pipeline of projects and future capital investment decisions. “The proposal developments to be advanced under the Technological Strategic Projects Fund, including 5 nationwide already announced, will complement significant investment right across the technological sector and further education and training sector.” Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery, and Reform Paschal Donohoe, who attended TU Dublin with Minister Harris today, said: “Since its inception, the Technological University (TU) agenda has sought to transform the Higher Education landscape and support the delivery of a highly skilled workforce, capable of meeting current as well as future economic and societal challenges at a national and regional level. “This investment in TU Dublin through the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund (TSSPF), in addition to the significant Exchequer resources provided to date, further highlights the Government’s support for the development and delivery of the Government’s TU agenda. “Ensuring these Universities are well equipped to deliver on our national ambitions is key. In total, including the NTF, approximately €4.1bn will be allocated to the Higher Education, Further Education and Training (FET) and Research and Innovation sectors in 2023. This reflects the importance of these sectors to the economy and the Government’s commitment to support learners through them.” President of TU Dublin Professor David FitzPatrick, welcomed the announcement: “TU Dublin is delighted to commence 2023 with this hugely significant announcement for the University, our students and the local community in Dublin 7, which will deliver a world-class multidisciplinary learning and industry engagement environment for students across the faculties of Engineering & Built Environment and Computing, Digital and Data, from apprenticeship to PhD. “Critically, the research, knowledge generation and skills development activities undertaken in Design + Construct will provide creative solutions that will be core to the sector’s efforts in addressing its key sustainability challenges that are contributing to the Climate Crisis, acting as a living construction laboratory encompassing best practices in sustainable design and construction.” Ciarán McCaffrey, Head of Capital Programmes in the HEA, said: “We welcome today’s announcement that TU Dublin are to proceed to the next phase of project proposal development under the Technological Sector Strategic Projects Fund (TSSPF). “The TSSPF is a key driver in delivering on the ambitions of the technological sector, aiding the sector in meeting the increased demand for education and driving more balanced regional development. The HEA look forward to working with all Higher Education Institutions, whose proposals are moving to the next phase of the TSSPF, in developing their preliminary business cases.” ENDS',\n",

       "  'title': 'Housing Minister rules out introducing regulations on people renting out spare rooms',\n",
       "  'text': 'HOUSING MINISTER DARRAGH O’Brien has ruled out introducing regulations on homeowners who rent a spare room to students, saying that implementing rules would reduce supply. In response to a Parliamentary Question by Fine Gael’s Neale Richmond, who asked if rights available to typical renters would be extended to people living in rented rooms, O’Brien said that the Government had no plans to introduce new regulations. Under current legislation, the Residential Tenancies Board does not have authority over licence agreements for people who are renting a room in a house where the landlord also lives. Rented rooms, or “digs”, are typically used by students while attending college and have been in short supply in recent years, with campaigns by students’ unions being run to boost the number of people offering rooms. Currently, people can rent out a room in their home and make up to €14,000 in rent tax free through the Rent a Room Relief tax credit. There has also been a lack of availability in overall student accommodation in recent years, with the Government now set to part-fund the construction of an additional 667 student beds across an initial three colleges. Despite challenges within the sector, O’Brien says that he does not believe adding regulations to the sector will improve the availability of digs. “I do not consider that there is a need for a legal regulatory framework in this area. Digs accommodation is an integral housing solution that suits both lodgers and home owners, providing an important source of revenue and, in some circumstances, social interaction,” O’Brien said. “Any attempt at regulating ‘digs’ is highly likely to impact negatively on the supply of this traditional and important source of accommodation.” He said that people who live in digs “benefit from the goodwill that exists to ensure that both lodgers and home owners are happy with the arrangement”. “It is possible for the arrangements to be formalised by way of a licence between the parties, but this is a matter of choice for the parties themselves to agree on,” he added. Despite not having plans to introduce regulations, O’Brien added that it would be kept under review.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Are we waiting for an Irish recession which may never arrive?',\n",
       "  'text': 'The economy continues to hold up, despite pressures from the cost-of-living crisis. New Central Statistics Office (CSO) figures give insights into the impact on households of soaring inflation and how they are responding. Huge uncertainty remains and there is no doubt that we are seeing a sharp slowdown in growth. But with the multinational sector still contributing to growth and signs from the euro zone not as bad as anticipated, might 2023 again see the Irish economy hanging in? 1. Standard of living edging down The cost-of-living crisis is, of course, having a big impact. A key insight from the latest CSO figures is the hit on the disposable income of households – a measure of the standard of living. The real (inflation-adjusted) level of disposable income fell in the third quarter by around 0.4 per cent compared to the previous three months – and has declined in three of the last four quarters. It peaked in the third quarter of 2021, when it reached the highest level in the 24-year history of collecting the data. The longer term trend here was a big fall in living standards after the 2008 financial crash followed by a few years of not much change and then a strong recovery. The drop after the crash was around 11 per cent, based on the latest CSO figures looking at household disposable income. There followed a period when living standards bumped along before a rise started in 2015. They did not get back to their pre-financial crash peak until early 2107. By the third quarter of last year, living standards as measured by disposable income had risen by more than 30 per cent from their lowest levels after the financial crash. They have now fallen by 1.4 per cent from this peak. The big question is what happens next. Notably, the latest fall in living standards is due to higher inflation. People’s incomes have, on average, continued to rise – unlike in the wake of the financial crash, job numbers remain strong, unemployment is at a record low and wages, on average, are rising. Household earnings were up in the third quarter of 2022 as more people were in work – but soaring inflation outpaced this growth, leaving real incomes lower. That, if you like, is the bad news. 2. But savings are up and spending is solid The better news is that despite this, consumer spending has been quite resilient and also households – probably largely better-off ones – are continuing to accumulate significant savings. Savings were running at 19.5 per cent of income in the third quarter of last year, as shown by the latest CSO figures. According to a note from Davy economist Conall MacCoille: “This is an enormous buffer for many households to potentially sustain spending through the squeeze in real incomes from energy bills and elevated CPI inflation.” Savings rates here remain among the highest internationally and have transformed from the years before the financial crash – Irish consumers, chastened by the experience of the crash, are much more cautious now, a trend also evident in total borrowing figures, with net savings also boosted by debt being paid down, as well as more cash in the bank. Savings rates now are close to double the 10 per cent average in the years before the pandemic, even if they have fallen back from their pandemic lockdown highs when many normal spending routes – holidays, nights-out and so on – were closed off. Consumer spending also remains surprisingly resilient, despite the squeeze on incomes. Here we need to be careful to understand the impact of inflation. Households are spending more cash because prices are going up, but their money isn’t going as far as it did before. Nonetheless, the latest figures show a slight increase in the volume of consumer goods and services purchased during the third quarter. As this coincides with lower disposable income, it suggest households are dipping into savings a bit to keep up consumption. More recent CSO figures suggest that the squeeze on spending continues to tighten. Retail sales figures for the month, which look at spending on goods, show the total cash spend by consumers was up 3.6 per cent year on year in November, but the actual volume of goods this bought was down 4.2 per cent. The gap is explained by inflation and particularly the need by households to spend around 20 per cent more on energy bills. Excluding volatile car sales, the volume of sales was nonetheless up 3.5 per cent in November on the previous month. So far, household spending, a vital piece of the overall economic picture, while under pressure, is hanging in. Christmas trends will be interesting to watch. 3. What about the rest of the economy? The business sector is the other key part of the economy to watch. While forward-looking purchasing managers’ indices show nervousness and indicate a slowdown, employment remains strong. The latest official figures show a drop to 4.3 per cent in the unemployment rate and jobs website Indeed says the level of postings on its site remain 60 per cent up on pre-pandemic levels. Grant Thornton’s latest survey of Irish business also shows that attracting and retaining labour remains a key issue for Irish companies. So while we know of lay-offs and slowing recruitment in the tech sector – and the latest BNP Paribas index suggests that construction firms have also slowed hiring – there is still strong demand for people in many sectors and this is supporting wages as well as job numbers. Employment tends to be a lagging indicator when a slowdown hits, so these figures bear close watching going into 2023. But so far, given the hit to the economy and to businesses from higher prices, jobs have held up better than would have been expected. Recent figures also show that the export sector remains strong and we know that, driven by multinationals, this continues to lead to strong growth in GDP and even in figures such as Gross National Income which factor out some of the distortions from the multinational sector. The latest data shows that gross value added by industry in the State was 21 per cent – (or €17.8 billion) higher in the third quarter than in the same period in 2021- much of it driven by manufacturing, within which pharma and medtech remains dominant. The ICT sector grew, but at a slower pace – and will likely slow or decline this year. While much of the extra value added flowed back in profit repatriations and royalty payments, multinationals continue to support Ireland’s overall economic figures. Domestic businesses continued their bounceback from Covid-19 lockdowns. However some closures in areas such as the restaurant sector show that the combined impact of Covid and the cost-of-living crisis is taking its toll. 4. The bottom line The resilience of the economy here – and signs that the euro zone may not hit the deep recession which had been anticipated – give some cause for optimism that Irish growth can stay in positive territory this year. This will be supported by multinationals, while the cost-of-living squeeze will continue to put pressure on households and their spending. The consumer sector may thus face its own mini-recession and this will continue to put some domestic firms in trouble, with predictions of a jump in liquidations. But with strong savings in better-off households, overall spending levels will not see the kind of fall seen after the financial crash. The uncertain course of the war in Ukraine – and the implications of this for the world economy – mean the economic outlook for the Republic remains impossible to predict with any confidence. Sentiment has been shaken by the cost-of-living crisis and growth has slowed rapidly after the bounceback from Covid shutdowns in the domestic economy. But what we can say is that, so far, the impact of the cost-of-living crisis has been a good deal less dramatic than would have been expected.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Developer Johnny Ronan in €140m deal for Citi’s Dublin HQ',\n",
       "  'text': 'Johnny Ronan’s Ronan Group Real Estate (RGRE) has acquired Citigroup’s existing European headquarters on Dublin’s North Wall Quay. While the value of the deal has not been disclosed, RGRE is understood to have paid about €140 million to secure ownership of the property in the face of competition from UK-headquartered private equity property manager Henderson Park, and from developer Shane Whelan’s Westridge Real Estate. The offices at 1 North Wall Quay were offered to the market by agent Knight Frank at a guide price of €120 million last March. News of RGRE’s purchase of the property comes just six days after The Irish Times reported its completion of a €300 million deal with Citi to develop a new European headquarters for the US-headquartered banking giant at its Waterfront South Central site in Dublin’s north docklands. Citi is understood to be paying about €100 million to acquire the site, with a further €200 million being set aside for the construction of its new base. Due for completion in 2026, the bank’s proposed footprint will equate to roughly 60 per cent of the 430,000sq ft of office accommodation RGRE intends to develop as part of the wider north docklands scheme. Once Citi’s workforce is ready to move into Waterfront South Central and vacate the company’s current premises at 1 North Wall Quay, RGRE will take ownership of the building, with plans being put in place to transform the property into a 500,000sq ft landmark office capable of accommodating a major corporate occupier. RGRE completed its purchase of Citi’s existing headquarters with funding provided by Landfair, a company headed up by Colony Capital’s former managing director of investment management, Stefan Jaeger. During his tenure at Colony, Mr Jaeger worked in partnership with RGRE on its delivery of Irish and European headquarters for Amazon, Salesforce and Facebook owner, Meta. Commenting on his company’s completion of its two-part deal with Citi, RGRE chief executive Rory Williams said: “The choice of Waterfront South Central (WSC) as the future home of Citi in the European Union represents a major vote of confidence in the continued strength of the Irish economy. This demonstrates the increasing desirability of Dublin as a European base for leading global companies, especially in the financial and banking sectors. “Ronan Group’s expertise in delivering world-class buildings has also received a vote of confidence, as demonstrated by the institutional backing of our transaction to redevelop Citi’s current HQ at North Wall Quay.” Davinia Conlan, interim Citi country head for Ireland, said: “We are thrilled to have finalised the location for our new building in Ireland. Our aim is to develop a state-of-the-art, sustainable workplace with the highest standards of design and technology. This significant investment is a signal of our commitment to Ireland, to Europe and to our people.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Wave of small landlords selling investment properties, claims report',\n",
       "  'text': 'Approximately 40 per cent of property sales in the final three months of last year involved landlords selling their investment properties, according to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI). The finding, contained in the SCSI’s latest annual report, appears to buttress the industry narrative that smaller landlords are being squeezed out of the market by stricter rent controls and higher tax burdens. The report found that increasing levels of buy-to-let properties were being put on the market, aggravating supply shortages in the rental sector. Landlord exodus It noted that on average 40 per cent of residential sale instructions to agents in the fourth quarter of 2022 were landlords selling their investment property. The SCSI linked the exodus of smaller landlords to “overly complex” rent legislation; low rental returns; and compliance with “onerous” housing standards. “The trend of private landlords exiting the market has serious implications for the supply of rental properties,” warned John O’Sullivan, chairman of the SCSI’s practice and policy committee. “SCSI agents are reporting that the supply of available units to rent is at one of the lowest levels ever experienced and they don’t believe the situation is set to improve in the short term,” he said, noting that almost eight out of 10 agents surveyed by the SCSI are of the view that individual buy-to-let second-hand rental units being sold at present will not be replaced in the rental market in the next two years. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has promised to introduce incentives to retain smaller landlords amid a pronounced decline in available rental properties. Property website Daft noted recently that there were just 1,087 homes available to rent nationally on its website as of November 1st, including just 345 in Dublin. In its report, the SCSI predicted house prices would continue to rise this year by an average of 2 per cent — 1 per cent in the first quarter of 2023 and a further 1 per cent over the course of the next three quarters — despite the dampening effects of inflation and higher interest rates, which have triggered reversals in other countries most notably the UK. While economic uncertainty, inflation and interest rate hikes have cooled the market, affordability and viability remain key issues, it said. It calculated that new homes remain unaffordable for first-time buyers in several counties. On the basis of a first-time buyer (FTB) couple having a combined annual income of €89,000 and being able to borrow €356,000, equivalent to four times gross salary as per the Central Bank rules, the SCSI estimates counties Kildare and Wicklow would be unaffordable based on average house prices by €27,000 and €74,000 respectively. Meath, Cork and Galway remain affordable to the average FTB couple with available purchasing power exceeding new homes prices by as much as €28,000, €8,000 and €21,000 respectively, it said. Direct impact On the wider issue of supply, the group said while new housing completions in 2022 are expected to be at their highest levels in approximately a decade, about 25,000, there is concern among SCSI agents that commencements and planning permission numbers are declining and that this will have a direct impact on the number of completions this year and possibly into 2024. It said its members had highlighted the cost of construction as a particular concern in relation to the supply of new homes with inflation and labour shortages contributing to higher costs. The SCSI estimated that based on current new housing completion projections there will need to be an increase of almost 8 per cent of new home output each year to 2030 to meet the Government’s Housing for All targets. This means the State would need to be building 27,000 new homes this year, rising to 39,000 in five years and over 45,000 by 2030.',\n",

       "  'title': 'DUP must give up its divisive sabre-rattling and do what&amp;rsquo;s best for people of the North',\n",
       "  'text': 'Troy was the capital of a rich and powerful kingdom which fell to the Greeks by deception – the Trojan horse ruse, according to the Iliad. This episode in one of the oldest works of literature still widely read by modern audiences continues to cast a spell, including on hard-line loyalists convinced the Northern Ireland Protocol is another Trojan horse engineered to con them out of the UK. The trope of a plucky people weathering siege, a people who cannot be beaten by fair means but may be betrayed by foul, has enduring appeal to loyalism. Somehow, this endlessly convenient theme has managed to embed itself in the protocol narrative.Jeffrey “Hector” Donaldson has positioned himself as a strong leader protecting his citadel against predators, as Dublin and Brussels are characterised. Eventually, Troy’s Hector was outfought by the Greek warrior Achilles. But it needn’t always be a case of death or glory, a defeated opponent lashed to the victor’s chariot and his remains dragged around the city walls. Compromise is possible if the will is there. A big if, in this case.But nothing else will revive the North’s democratic institutions after a layoff of almost a year. When then-First Minister Paul Givan of the DUP resigned last February it effectively meant Stormont’s collapse. Bulldozing is easier than building, unfortunately. A reluctance to compromise has taken root, and it has been allowed to drift for too long.But there is always cause to hope. Positions can shift, especially if local politicians feel listened to when big-wigs arrive on their turf. Currently, a flurry of activity is happening north of the Border, with senior politicians from Westminster and Leinster House congregating for meetings and side-meetings, handshakes and the odd cold shoulder – stupidity on stilts from James Cleverly’s staff. Britain’s foreign secretary should have notched up an easy score in Belfast by sitting down with all five parties. But the exclusion of Mary Lou McDonald, which led to the SDLP staying away out of solidarity, turned it into a Whitehall bungle.Still, if we’re comparing putdowns, the latest decision by His Majesty’s government on border controls is a bigger snub than leaving the Sinn Féin leader out of a meeting. There’ll be other days and other meetings. But checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Britain, to ensure they comply with EU regulations, are another matter entirely for loyalism. They show which way the wind is blowing.Yesterday, Britain published legislation on border controls at ports which takes matters out of the Assembly’s hands. There will be a green lane – minimal paperwork and no routine checks – for goods from Britain staying in Northern Ireland, and a red lane for goods moving onwards to the Republic and into the EU. Here we have a sensitive spot for the DUP: in a show of strength, its agriculture minister Edwin Poots had construction of checking areas stopped – but the UK is now signalling intent to complete the facilities as part of its negotiations with the EU. This suggests an administration looking for a solution to the EU’s concerns rather than the DUP’s.A deal acceptable to the UK and the EU is the goal. A deal that also passes the DUP’s stress test naturally is desirable in the interests of harmony, but may not be possible – and at some point Rishi Sunak, who has said he’s working flat out to break the deadlock, will shrug, or pull a sad face. But the DUP’s objections won’t be allowed to block progress. On past form, the DUP will turn to the Conservatives’ ERG wing. Support from that quarter may be forthcoming – or the Tory hard right may be preoccupied with more pressing matters as strikes cripple Britain across multiple sectors.Mr Donaldson is no fool, and needs something he can sell to his base. Yesterday he said some progress was made on “technical issues” but there were “major political issues” not yet addressed. Political issues, of course, are the reason the DUP is anti-protocol – fear of being edged out of the UK’s Elysian Fields. Nothing to do with a trade pact which gives Northern Ireland a less awful Brexit than other parts of the union. Let’s not forget the protocol itself is a compromise and a majority of MLAs favour it. As does a majority of the broader population.The DUP is illogical in complaining trade checks distinguish it from the rest of the union when the party has had no problem with other differences, from an armed police force to abortion law to Sunday trading restrictions. Nor is there any consistency in the DUP boycotting the Assembly, while continuing to sit at Westminster – where the protocol was passed into law. Little wonder people wonder if what’s at issue here is a party unable to manage peaceful transition of power.Politics in Northern Ireland continues to quiver on the verge of collapse, with the region being run yet again by its civil servants, hardly an example of democracy in action because they have no mandate from the people. The cost-of-living and healthcare crises demand local politicians making decisions locally.Talk-talk is preferable to the alternative, but none of what’s happening currently is particularly democratic. The Assembly lying idle represents a fundamental lack of respect for democracy by the DUP, although the party argues its proposed boycott was in its manifesto. What a topsy-turvy world, when an electoral result is interpreted as a vote not to enter government. A generation on from the Good Friday Agreement – a shining example of compromise, but one which the DUP didn’t sign up to – people deserve better of those elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly (or Norlin Airlin Assemblie in Ulster-Scots, in case you’re interested).It’s in the North’s best interests to give the DUP some life jackets to reactivate the Assembly.

       "  'title': 'Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin TD, announces launch of Shared Island Civic Society Fund - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin TD, today announced an open call for applications for a new funding scheme aimed at enhancing civic society engagement across the island of Ireland. The Shared Island Civic Society Fund will promote practical North South cooperation and engagement, across a range of sectors and themes, consistent with the objectives and commitments of the Good Friday Agreement. It will encourage and support civic society and community organisations to further strengthen existing partnerships and/or to develop new cross-border links, to build connectivity on issues of concern for the island of Ireland. The scheme, which has been developed as part of the Government’s Shared Island initiative and supported through the Shared Island Fund, will provide €500,000 to cross-border projects in the first year of operation. It is expected that increased funding will be made available in future years. The Fund will support regional, national and sectoral cross-border civic engagement in areas including Climate and Environment; Community development; Heritage and conservation; Social Enterprise; Charity and Voluntary Sector, and Sport. Announcing the launch of the Fund in Armagh, the Tánaiste said: “I am pleased to launch this initiative, which will complement the vital work that is already supported through my Department’s Reconciliation Fund and other funding schemes, to promote North South cooperation and enhance cross-border civic, economic, cultural, and political links across the island. “Civic society often provides a unique dynamic for building understanding and consensus in areas where politics alone cannot. There is already deep and constructive cooperation within civic society and it is encouraging to see so many organisations already collaborating on an all-island basis, combining ideas and capacity to deliver benefits far beyond what can be achieved separately. “However, for civic society to flourish, it requires support. This Fund will reinforce the important civic engagement already taking place and support new and innovative cross-border civic initiatives, with North/South or East/West dimensions. “We are enabling civic society to develop new links, forums, and projects that will help to build a truly shared island. “I strongly encourage civic organisations North and South to apply.” Applications for funding under the Shared Island Civic Society Fund will be accepted from Monday, 16 January 2023 until Monday, 27 February 2023. Further information, including eligibility and application process details, is available at https://www.dfa.ie/about-us/funding/sharedislandcivicsocietyfund/. ENDS',\n",

       "  'title': 'Machinery Focus: Vertical take-off for Tyrone Trailers',\n",
       "  'text': 'Meath Farm Machinery has long set out its stall as being associated with quality equipment, and it has recently added Tyrone Trailers to its list of franchises, a make that it believes fits right in with this philosophy. Tyrone Trailers is a relative newcomer to the machinery business although its founder and managing director, Declan McMoran, has been crafting trailers and other machinery for over 25 years. Manufacturing hotspot Co. Tyrone itself has become an engineering hub over the last few decades with a large number of companies supplying the quarrying and construction industries located there. Little surprise then that from this pool of engineering talent and expertise there has arisen a new company with the same ethos of building strength and quality as that of the multinationals supplying the construction industry. Like many engineering companies, pinning down an exact birth date is a difficult quest, however, Declan had started making trailers on a part-time basis for a friend in 2018, going full-time in 2019, and he has not looked back since. Application of expertise The impetus to go full-time came when Declan suddenly realised that he had nine trailers on order – as well as a day job. It was sink or swim time, so he took the plunge and last year the 20 staff that now work for the company produced 280 trailers for sale in Ireland, the UK and Europe, with the Nordic countries in particular being a strong market for the company. This is, by any measure, a spectacular growth rate and it has been helped by the arrival of Kevin McSorley as sales manager, whose experience in selling heavy equipment abroad has been invaluable. Herein lies the key to the design of the product, it is heavy engineering scaled down rather than light engineering scaled up; there is a solidity about the trailers wherever you look. Shopping list Meath Farm Machinery first became aware of Tyrone Trailers when the company went out looking for a new loader to use themselves for recovery work. They had a list of requirements in mind, the chief one being that it had to be well built and well finished, it would be seen behind a John Deere whenever it was out on the road after all. The trailer they eventually purchased from the company has a length of 30ft and a gross weight of 30t, giving a carrying capacity of 22.5t. It has two fixed and one steering axle, all on steel springs. As yet, no customer has requested air suspension, although Declan is by no means averse to fitting it if required. The rear ramps are are hydraulically adjustable for width and spread to 2.9m to accommodate combine harvesters and other wide-tracked machinery, a facility bolstered by outriggers giving another 15cm to either side of the deck. 20t pull At the front sits a 10t hydraulic winch which is mounted strongly enough to enable the use of a snatch block, thus doubling its capacity to 20t. Big hydraulic winches are not cheap, but the beauty of running them from a tractor’s hydraulics is that they are a lot quicker than relying on a 12v trailer plug to supply the power. The deck is of 50mm timber, except for the steel plates sitting above the wheels. These were specified by Meath Farm Machinery to avoid a build-up of mud and dirt on the wood, which would shorten its life. This ability to fully customise the specifications of the trailer is another strong attraction for customers, according to Kevin. Tyrone Trailers build to spec Buying a trailer is not simply a matter of choosing the colour, there is always a discussion with the customer as to what he intends the trailer to be used for, as this will help ensure his needs are met. In the case of Meath Farm Machinery, the recovery of large machines, such as harvesters, would be the most demanding task asked of it, and so the trailer was designed and built with this in mind. The ramps, winch, axle arrangement, outriggers etc., were all requested by Meath Farm Machinery when ordering the trailer, and despite the manufacturer’s heavy workload, they were all incorporated into the final item. One point to note from the rapid growth of Tyrone Trailers is that it was not overly held-up by material shortages, which is something often complained of elsewhere in the industry. Steel supply did not hold up production to any great extent, and it appears that component availability has returned to something like normal, with shipment delays easing as more containers become available globally. Two-month delivery The company quotes a lead time of around eight weeks and is happily continuing to take orders for its whole range, which includes dump trailers as well as low loaders. Prices are also said to have stabilised. As to the future then, while it is the agricultural/construction contractor market which provides the mainstay of its business, it is intending to enter the commercial vehicle sector with bespoke low loaders later this year. Tyrone Trailers may be a young company, but it is coming from an area steeped in engineering and managed by people who know the business and how to work with steel. As yet, despite its immediate success, it has to make its presence felt fully on the Irish market, but with the quality of build shown in this particular example, that may not be too long in coming.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Oxfam calls for wealth tax as the number of Ireland&#039;s super-rich doubles in a decade',\n",
       "  'text': 'Despite a drop from nine to eight in the number of Irish billionaires following the death last year of Indian-Irish construction magnate Pallonji Mistry, Oxfam said the number of Irish people who earn more than $5m (€4.6m) has also doubled in the past ten years. According to Forbes, which Oxfam uses to track global individual wealth, Limerick brothers John and Patrick Collison top Ireland’s rich list with individual wealth of $8.1bn (€7.5bn) each. Oxfam said their combined wealth of €15bn is more than the €10.3bn in wealth held by the entire bottom 50% of the population. The Oxfam report said that, globally, the richest 1% have acquired nearly twice as much wealth as the rest of humanity over the past two years. “This rising wealth at the top and rising poverty for the rest are two sides of the same coin, proof that our economic system is functioning exactly how the rich and powerful designed it to,” Oxfam Ireland’s CEO, Jim Clarken said. “A wealth tax on elite Irish wealth at graduated rates of 2%, 3% and 5% above a high threshold of €4.7m would raise €8.2bn annually, with the potential to transform Irish public services in health, housing and education while also delivering on our international and climate commitments,” he said. Third on Ireland’s rich list is US financier John Grayken who founded private equity firm Lone Star Funds and who took Irish citizenship in 1999. Telecoms magnate Denis O’Brien is fourth, followed by British hedge-fund manager John Armitage who took Irish citizenship in 1999. Campbell’s Soup heir John Dorrance III is sixth followed by financier Dermot Desmond who Forbes says has an individual wealth of €1.9bn. Eugene Murtagh who founded building materials giant Kingspan is eighth on the list. According to Forbes, John Collison aged 32 remains one of the world’s youngest billionaires positioned 13th on the list. His 34-year-old brother Patrick is 20th on the list of youngest billionaires. Oxfam said money derived from new wealth taxes was urgently needed by ordinary people. \"Entire countries are facing bankruptcy, with the poorest countries now spending four times more repaying debts to rich creditors than on healthcare,\" Mr Clarken said. \"Three quarters of the world’s governments are planning austerity-driven public sector spending cuts — including on healthcare and education — of $7.8 trillion over the next five years,” They said inequality has led to the World Bank announcing that the world has almost certainly lost its goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030. The Oxfam report was published as economic leaders meet in Davos. The WEF’s annual Global Risks Report showed the threat of recession, the cost-of-living crisis and mounting debt distress will dominate the outlook for the next two years. The World Bank this week slashed its growth forecasts for most countries and regions, and warned that new adverse occurrences could tip the global economy into a recession. The CEOs of Moderna and Pfizer will also be speaking at the summit, with one panel devoted to how fast vaccines can be created the next time a pandemic hits. The future of work will also feature. Whether to return to the office, as well as the rise of “quiet quitting” and the four-day week.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Michael Stone profile: the quiet engineering pioneer caught up in Paschal Donohoe posters furore',\n",
       "  'text': 'MICHAEL Stone is described by associates as an intensely private and quietly impressive man who would recoil at the exposure he is now getting for paying to put up Paschal Donohoe’s election posters in 2016. The 54-year-old engineering and construction entrepreneur, who began his career as an apprentice with the ESB before founding the very successful Designer Group (DG) in 1992, is known within his industry as reserved yet driven.Advisers who have worked on deals with him say he is low-key but confident, and expert in his field but humble enough to take advice on subjects outside his domain.Known for his early arrivals in his firm’s office in Blanchardstown, Dublin, his ambition and professionalism grew DG from a start-up to one of Ireland’s leading electrical and mechanical engineering firms.Over 30 years, Mr Stone has retained 100pc ownership of the company, developing it into an international specialist with a blue-chip client list boasting Google, Amazon, Diageo and a host of high-profile public-sector projects in Dublin.Before Covid knocked the construction sector back for a couple of years, DG achieved turnover of €250m from operations in Ireland, the UK, Europe and Africa.For the year ending March 2022, DG had turnover of €175m and profits of €18m, including the proceeds from selling 50pc of a joint venture in a facilities management firm to its partner, Sisk.In the last two years, the company took nearly €5m in Covid wage subsidies too.Mr Stone has not taken any dividends from the firm in recent years, despite €36m in cash in hand. But directors’ remuneration is generous at €2.9m.The company does not disclose the compensation of key personnel, but Mr Stone is doing well enough financially to have bought a sprawling mid-century mansion in Killiney, south Dublin, last April for €4.6m – below the list price of €5m.A promotional video for the home by estate agents Sherry FitzGerald shows extensive and exuberant gardens with dramatic views across Killiney Bay.Characteristically, the house is hidden on a quiet lane behind tall hedges and a heavy security gate.But even though Mr Stone doesn’t court public attention for his achievements, he has nonetheless become a person of influence.He was a ministerial appointee to the Land Development Agency (LDA) in December 2021 and acted as chair for the agency’s first three meetings in January, February and March last year, reverting to a non-executive director role once former Goodbody corporate finance director Cormac O’Rourke assumed the chair in April.Mr Stone has waived his remuneration fee since the outset of his involvement with the LDA and does not claim expenses.The avid Dublin GAA supporter has also chaired the North East Inner City Initiative – in Mr Donohoe’s constituency – since 2017, where he has compiled a lengthy list of accomplishments, including community festivals; training and education initiatives; action against crime and drugs; and several sport and recreation programmes.As Construction Industry Federation (CIF) president in 2015 and 2016, Mr Stone was determined to rehabilitate the reputation of the industry after the catastrophe of the financial crisis.“We have been lying down and taking a beating for too long,” he told magazine in 2015.“Our members have not made huge amounts of money at the expense of the Government or the people of Ireland. We have built and delivered projects that have allowed people to go to work, school, college and receive treatment in our hospitals. We should be proud of what we are achieving.”In a callback to his own professional origins, he promoted the value of apprenticeships during his CIF tenure, pushing member firms to invest in their own training and development programmes as a pathway into the industry. He has made that same emphasis at DG, where 170 of its 750 Irish staff came up as apprentices.Those who have worked alongside Mr Stone praised him for his progressive approach as CEO of DG, investing in technological innovation to create a more hospitable workplace for women. “Employers need to provide better facilities for women,” he told in a 2018 interview.“I think a lot of building sites traditionally are not set up in a way to allow women to work comfortably. My own opinion is that the secret to getting more women involved in the industry is the further development of off-site fabrication.”DG’s innovative approach has made the company a favourite of tech firms, pharma companies and brewers such as Guinness.In addition to projects at famous private addresses such as St James’s Gate, in recent years DG has been central to several major public-sector projects. The company’s vans are seen everywhere on the capital’s streets.A partial list of highly visible projects includes the construction of Technology University Dublin’s Grangegorman campus with Sisk, high-spec installs at Trinity College’s business school and bioscience facility, a fit-out at Dublin Castle and the refurbishment of Government Buildings and Leinster House in 2018.Attempts were made to contact Mr Stone via his company but messages were not returned.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Republic using productivity boom to invest public infrastructure and housing – Slugger O'Toole\",\n",
       "  'text': 'A typically spunky piece from the New Statesman’s new columnist Wolfgang Münchau starts with a great quote from Otto von Bismarck: “Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others.” He has Angela Merkel in his sights. He notes that despite the appearance of economic success, her austerity policies have led to a public investment shortfall in public investment of some half-a-trillion pounds, with the dire consequences only leeching up from the ground slowly in a series of spectacular shortfalls. He cites a motorway linking the north and south of Germany which has been closed because there’s no money to repair a bridge that’s become unsafe, and one Bundeswehr general has warned the army is so underfunded it cannot fight a war for more than a few weeks. He accuses Merkel of not being interested in solving problems, something he argues you can get away with until they accumulate and blow up in your face. Germany has relied on cheap Russian gas to sustain old industries so many sectors have missed the digital revolution. Productivity has fallen through the floor. Münchau recommends higher public investment as a way to levering it back up again on the basis that even a modest increase in productivity ‘would have a disproportionately large effect on the government’s ability to borrow’. So, finally, to Ireland. There have been worries about the fact the current coalition government has been throwing caution to the wind and doing the opposite: borrowing like crazy to fund infrastructure investment and critically from a political point of view, housing. According to Cliff Taylor there is a gap growing in the government’s plans in the south to calm a housing crisis which burgeoned out of af largely inactive period from the time of post crash ghost estates, until the present government set out its plans in the summer of 2020: The end of the era of super-low interest rates is the fundamental reason. For years, house building and the wider construction sector was funded almost exclusively by the Irish banking sector, via loans to builders and developers and also mortgage borrowers. Irish banks were in on both sides of an over-inflating market. Then, after the crash, Irish banks stepped out in terms of lending to developers and international funds stepped in. But now, as interest rates rise, the game has changed for these investors. When you can get a safe return of 3.5 per cent for putting your cash into US government bonds, the profit needed to justify investment in Irish property goes up. Meanwhile the cost of building has shot upwards. The economics of building apartments – already challenging – is now undermined and even house building becomes more financially difficult. So the international investors are stepping out. And with domestic builders also hit by higher costs and the Irish banks still loath to extend their lending to the property sector, there is a funding gap. The Irish government is now planning to offer support… …effectively giving a Government guarantee to buy some or all of certain projects when completed. In turn, this would help builders and developers to get finance from banks or investors to get schemes under way and finish them. It is also eyeing up some 70,000 planning permissions that have already granted and hoping that if can these could be got moving, it would make a huge difference to the figures. But, and this where the contraction of the two former dominant parties at local level hurts… Development efforts by local authorities and State agencies seem painfully slow and there is often little sense that everyone is pulling in the one direction. Local politicians try to secure their positions by objecting to many projects. Whoever is in government will face the same problem of “getting things done” when faced with a dysfunctional system, and a Nimby culture. Against this background, the challenge now for the Government is to ensure that the bucks being thrown into housing – probably €5 billion or more this year when the cost of tax incentives is added to direct spending – generate the required bang. Luckily (because of the presence of multinationals) productivity in the south is not the burden it is in the UK or Germany. The sun is shining in the south (€12bn or £10.5bn in corporation tax receipts in 2020) and the government is mending (and building) roofs. As Münchau notes of Liz Truss’s failed productivity experiment: It is not the debt that is the problem, but what you do with it.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Ministers Harris and Ryan welcome record number of enrolments in retrofitting programmes for 2022 - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Simon Harris TD together with Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Eamon Ryan TD have today welcomed the significant progress being made in the number of participants in Near Zero Energy Building (NZEB) and Retrofit upskilling and reskilling programmes in 2022. Following progress in developing a national network of Centres of Excellence in retrofit skills training, including NZEB skills, the number of workers availing of these opportunities has increased steadily since the first centre was opened in 2020. Numbers have risen from 363 to 793 enrolments in 2021 and to a record 2,034 enrolments in 2022. This reflects an increase of 118% between 2020 and 2021, and 156% between 2021 and 2022. Minister Harris said “I am delighted to see the increased uptake of these important courses. We are on track to having the highly knowledgeable and skilled workers needed to meet workforce needs between now and 2030. “With the opening of the ETB Centres of Excellence, the capacity for workers looking to upskill in the area of Green Skills is there. As demand for retrofit increases there will be significant employment opportunities and I would encourage anyone in the construction trade to get onboard and help us build warmer, more energy efficient homes. “Last year also saw the establishment of a dedicated Construction and Green Skills Programme Office within SOLAS. Working with ETBs nationally, this office is focused on developing programmes and initiatives to drive forward this reform agenda with a particular focus on the construction sector. “The government has set an ambitious target to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030 and the increased numbers enrolling on NZEB courses and establishment of the SOLAS Programme office are important steps towards delivering on this target.” Minister Ryan said: “Last year we met our target to retrofit 27,000 homes. This year we aim to retrofit 37,000 and I have no doubt we will make that target also, and then, those beyond that. The pipeline of interest is huge. People up and down the country are clamouring to make their homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to run. “The one way we can keep up with this demand is to ensure that we have enough highly skilled people to respond to it. The increased numbers we are seeing committing to these NZEB courses is so encouraging. And while it means that more and more homes can become better houses to live in, it also means that thousands of workers with valuable green skills can be sure that they have work for years, if not decades into the future. Green jobs are also sustainable jobs for the longterm.” The skills training is provided in a number of further and higher education facilities including at Centres of Excellence operated by Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB), Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board (LOETB), and Limerick Clare Education and Training Board (LCETB). Courses are also delivered in Cork ETB and Mayo-Sligo-Leitrim ETB with further provision due later this year and in 2024. The courses are free, fast and flexible with weekend and evening provision available. In many cases, where a person has an existing construction-related qualification, knowledge or experience, they can learn these skills quickly, usually within three-four days. Those in the sector interested in upskilling can find out more details by visiting gov.ie/therightcourse. The National Construction Training Campus in Mount Lucas also provide a 1 day tailored introductory programme for Transition Year and Leaving Cert students to give them a better understanding of NZEB principles while using a mixture of practical skills and theory. Retrofitting is both an important economic activity, and critical in meeting Ireland’s climate targets, and the delivery of the Government’s Housing for All plan. Nearly Zero Energy Buildings have a very high energy performance, with renewable sources as their dominant energy source. Making homes more energy efficient through retrofitting not only makes homes warmer and more comfortable, but can help households save money on bills and help to reach climate goals. ENDS Notes to the Editor The recently published Climate Action Plan 2023 (CAP23) sets out the actions required to halve our emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050. The SOLAS Green Skills for FET Roadmap 2021-2030 was launched in March 2022 incorporating the National Recovery and Resilience Plan and the Green Skills Action Programme which began in 2021. The National Recovery and Resilience Plan committed €29m to NZEB and Retrofit upskilling and reskilling programmes and €10m to green skills modules, and includes the provision of 4,550 retrofit and NZEB standard places and 60,000 green skills places by the end of 2022. Alongside courses in NZEB and retrofit, a national suite of Green Skills programmes is currently being developed by SOLAS in collaboration with enterprise partners for blended delivery by ETBs in areas such as sustainability awareness and resource efficiency to assist in delivering on these challenges. A SOLAS eCollege course on a general Introduction to Green Skills was developed in partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland. This was launched on 28 November 2022 and gives a taster insight into sustainability at home and in work.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Scotland’s construction sector faces a “major task ahead” to recruit workers – with industry bosses estimating almost 20,000 more staff will be needed over the next five years. A new report from the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) showed some 19,550 extra workers – 3,910 a year – will be required to meet demand in the sector between now and 2027 in Scotland.There is demand for workers for infrastructure projects, private housebuilding and repair and maintenance work, according to the annual construction skills network report.As part of its efforts to boost recruitment, the CITB has recently launched its employer network pilot project – which helps local firms recognise their training priorities.In Scotland, the pilot is being led by the Scottish Civils Training Group, with an initial focus on supporting employers from Inverness.In addition to this, the CITB’s Scottish Academy for Construction Opportunities awarded £1.3 million of funding to help support 1,000 job starts across the Highlands and Islands in a bid to reduce the skills gap.CITB Scotland engagement director Ian Hughes stressed that while the sector will “certainly face challenges heading into the new year”, the new report also showed there is “a lot of opportunity available for Scotland”.Mr Hughes said: “Despite the economic challenges, there is still huge demand for more workers in the industry and it will become even more important to retain our current workforce over the next 18 months.“There are a range of projects set to bring a steady stream of work into Scotland this year, including the new River Clyde bridge, Scottish Water’s £5 billion capital investment plans and £200 million towards Scottish Gas Networks mains replacement, to name a few.“These opportunities in the infrastructure and industrial sectors will be major drivers for growth in Scotland.”He continued: “Supporting the industry in attracting and retaining talent from right across Scotland will be our main priority, with a particular focus on training routes.“There’s no denying we have a major task ahead but I feel inspired by the resilience shown from industry over the last couple of years and look forward to supporting industry in emerging stronger when the recession ends.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Government getting ready to bail out the developers again',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Government is now considering the possibility of “advance purchasing” large numbers of private-sector apartment blocks that already have planning permission but haven’t yet been built for one reason or another. If Ministers were to proceed with this proposal, it would represent the biggest bailout of the property development sector in Irish history. The ballpark estimate is that developers have accumulated planning permission for at least 70,000 residential units – the vast majority of them apartments – granted by An Bord Pleanála or local authorities over the past four years that haven’t been “activated”. This phenomenon is at least partly due to the hoarding of land for its speculative purposes. But there is another major reason: the construction of high-rise, high-density apartments has become “economically unviable” because of higher interest rates and escalating inflation in the cost of building materials. The high-rise, high-density model – predominantly for exclusively build-to-rent (BTR) schemes – has turned out to be unbuildable due to the multiplicity of smaller apartments, generally studios or one-bedroom units, involved in most schemes. Each one requires kitchen and bathroom facilities, as well as extra fire safety precautions such as sprinkler systems. [ Frank McDonald’s future Dublin: Prepare for floods. Lose the ugly bridge. Dig an underground ] There is a bitter irony in all of this, because it was as a direct result of lobbying by the property industry that the planning system was upended in 2016 to permit developers bypass local planning authorities and make direct applications to An Bord Pleanála for large-scale housing schemes of 100 units or more. If sustainable residential communities are to be created, the BTR schemes that have planning permission would need to be redesigned to include a better mix of apartment sizes The changes were brought in by the then minister for housing Simon Coveney and they became even more prevalent after his successor, Eoghan Murphy, bowed to further pressure in 2018 and introduced mandatory ministerial planning guidelines that dumbed down apartment design standards to facilitate BTR schemes and promoted more high-rise development. These changes opened the floodgates to a torrent of applications to An Bord Pleanála for high-rise, ultra high-density apartment blocks in Dublin and elsewhere that were usually approved. [ Frank McDonald: Dundrum scheme’s overwhelming scale an indictment of the system ] The strategic housing development (SHD) process brought An Bord Pleanála, for the first time, into direct contact with developers and their agents; architects, planning consultants, chartered surveyors, structural engineers and others involved in what was aptly dubbed the “planning-industrial complex”. Its physical legacy is already visible in random high-rise eruptions on the skyline, including numerous BTR apartment blocks built at ultra-high densities. What’s waiting in the wings to be “activated” is yet more of the same type of schemes, largely comprising small flats on long corridors with no private amenity space and views out in only one direction. They are what the Government would be bringing into being if it was to embark on an “advance purchasing” programme of apartment developments with ready-to-go planning permissions, thereby “de-risking” private-sector developers – as the property lobby wants – and clearing the way for new homes to be built at scale, irrespective of their quality as places to live. The densities of many of the these unbuilt schemes are extraordinarily high. As the Dublin Democratic Planning Alliance has pointed out, these range from 330 units per hectare (uph) at Davitt Road in Inchicore to 347 uph at Clarehall on Malahide Road, 609 uph on the Circle K garage site in Donnybrook and 626 uph at Newmarket, in the Liberties. If sustainable residential communities are to be created, the BTR schemes that have planning permission would need to be redesigned to include a better mix of apartment sizes, with more two- and three-bedroom units, rather than an overwhelming preponderance of cell-like studios or one-bed apartments, intended to extract the maximum level of profit from rent. [ Frank McDonald: MetroLink will lay waste to chunks of the city centre but won’t integrate city transportation ] The Department of Housing has now revoked the “specific planning policy requirements” introduced in 2018 to permit lower design standards for BTR schemes. In a circular quietly issued to all planning authorities on December 22nd, it said “all apartment developments shall now adhere to the same standards ... regardless of the development type”. Advance purchasing of apartment blocks intended for the BTR market will also be extremely expensive, compared with units built directly by local authorities or approved housing bodies. For example, 14 two-bed social housing units in a high-rise scheme now under construction at Eglinton Road in Donnybrook were priced at €762,916 each – and that was back in 2020. It would be infinitely preferable if the Government were to adopt the latest idea put forward by industry lobby group Property Industry Ireland calling for European-style “low-rise, medium-density” housing at 40 to 80 uph as a more viable way of realising the declared objective of the National Planning Framework to achieve compact growth in cities and towns. The fact that this idea is now being put forward by the industry itself is an implicit admission that the whole SHD process – now mercifully ended – was an abject failure and that previous advocacy of the “high-rise, high-density” model helped in no small way to lead Ireland down the wrong road in terms of sustainable urban development.

       "  'text': 'Applications are open for the Niamh Burke Memorial Bursary, which will award a total of €10,000 to students pursuing studies linked to climate action and renewable energy in Ireland. The bursary was established by leading law firm Arthur Cox, in memory of their former colleague and Arthur Cox partner, Niamh Burke, who played a significant role in the development of the Irish wind energy sector and advised on some of Ireland’s largest, energy, infrastructure and construction projects. All relevant disciplines are open for consideration including law, economics, engineering, policy, science, planning and others. It is open to students planning to study in these or related fields in Ireland, at postgraduate level in 2023. If more than one person is selected, the bursary monies will be split between the successful applicants. “A year on and I still feel honoured to have been given this tremendous opportunity,” said one of last year’s winners, Aoife Stewart, from Drogheda in Louth. “The bursary provided me with vital financial support to pursue a masters in Environmental and Natural Resources law, which I am currently undertaking at University College Cork. “I have just completed the first semester of the programme and I am delighted with my decision to pursue a masters in this field. I am excited to continue my studies this year and to see where this degree leads me in the future.” Alex McLean, head of the energy and natural resource group at Arthur Cox said: “We are very pleased to continue providing this bursary in memory of our colleague Niamh Burke. Ireland has the potential to be at the forefront of the energy transition and we want to support the next generation who are working towards a carbon-neutral future.” The bursary was launched in 2020 and has already helped six people with their studies. It is funded by Arthur Cox and Niamh Burke’s family, to offer opportunities to a new generation of renewable energy experts. The fund is administered by Wind Energy Ireland. Dave Linehan, head of research, Wind Energy Ireland said: “Anything that supports and encourages academic excellence in this area is very welcome. Today’s renewable energy students will be the people making sure we reduce our CO2 emissions and work to end our dependence on foreign fossil fuels. We are supporting future leaders in Ireland’s fight against climate change.” Previous recipients have used the bursary to study at University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, NUI Galway, University College Cork, Dublin City University, and the Law Society of Ireland. Candidates can apply for the bursary until 2 March here. TechCentral Reporters Read More: renewable energy Renewables STEM students',\n",

       "  'title': 'New offices drive demand in Dublin as investors and occupiers shy away from older stock',\n",
       "  'text': 'Last year was an extraordinary year for Dublin’s office market, with take-up coming in above the long-term average, at a total of 2.64 million sq ft despite multiple disruptions and concerns, particularly in relation to global funding costs and accessibility. Demand for new space in the city centre dominated activity as occupier preference for space with the highest sustainable credentials and proximity to transport links comes to the fore. Offices located in Dublin 1 and 2 represented 70 per cent per cent of all the deals signed in 2022, with activity in the city’s north docklands particularly strong (25 per cent of total activity in 2022). While there were 37 deals signed in the final quarter, the top 10 made up 75 per cent of the total as a number of larger deals returned to the market. Deals of note in 2022 included ServiceNow’s decision to take 88,000sq ft at 60 Dawson in Dublin 2, A&L Goodbody’s decision to take 62,600sq ft at North Wall Quay, Dublin 1 and SMBC Aviation Capital’s decision to take 135,000sq ft at Fitzwilliam 28, Dublin 2. The largest deal of the year was completed in the final quarter, with Citigroup committing to a large new building in Dublin’s north docklands, which is due to complete in 2026. Prime rents ended the year at €70 per sq ft. An increase in the amount of space that has come to the “grey” market will give some occupiers more choice in 2023 and, combined with new space due to complete, is expected to result in a softening in prime rents, to €65 per sq ft by mid-year. Key factors such as a fundamentally higher funding cost environment (which is now set to remain in place), a higher cost base for construction, a dip in the office supply pipeline in 2024 and occupier preference for the best space, is expected to put a floor on rents and see a return to rental growth towards the end of 2023. While the overall Dublin market vacancy rate remains above 10 per cent as we start 2023 (and is expected to be more volatile in 2023 as grey market space is absorbed into the market), space available with Ber energy ratings of B and below will become less and less attractive to occupiers. The vacancy level that more accurately reflects the space that investors and occupiers are interested in is closer to 6 per cent. Supported by the continued performance of key sectors driving wider economic activity, Ireland remains well ahead of its euro zone counterparts, largely driven by the volume of jobs created over the 2019-2022 period, which has delivered the highest tax revenue on record. International investors researching the Dublin office market are well aware of Ireland’s strong labour market, and concerns about the impact of tech sector employment correction are being taken against this wider backdrop. Ireland is set to continue to remain of particular interest to international occupiers and investors, and while 2023 begins with a difficult global backdrop, the domestic environment is as well positioned as possible to allow for continued strong occupier activity in 2023. Professional services companies are expected to lead demand in 2023. Joan Henry is chief economist and head of research at Knight Frank Ireland',\n",

       "  'title': \"Minister Ryan launches Ireland's first all-electric town bus service in Athlone - MerrionStreet\",\n",
       "  'text': 'Athlone’s town bus service is to become Ireland’s first all-electric bus service. The service was officially launched by Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan TD in Athlone today (Friday). Operated by Ireland’s national bus company, Bus Éireann (BÉ), and funded by the Department of Transport through the National Transport Authority (NTA), physical works to transform the town bus service into a 100% electric operation began last year, with the service due to commence operations on the 29 January. The project, a €10 million investment by the NTA, is the first to launch under the Government’s Pathfinder Programme – a package of exemplar transport projects to be delivered by state agencies and local authorities around the country within the next three years. The Pathfinder Programme forms a key part of the implementation of the National Sustainable Mobility Policy, which sets out the government’s plan to meet Ireland’s requirement to achieve a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 in the transport sector. This Pathfinder project, an additional investment in public transport, will see 11 new state-of-the-art electric buses operate Athlone town services. The new fleet will reduce CO2 emissions by 400,000kg annually and will deliver a quieter, cleaner bus service for the town and passengers. Over 540,000 kilometres are operated on the Athlone town bus service each year, with over 10,000 passengers now using the service weekly – a 20% increase on 2019 figures. The new buses will be charged using newly-installed charging infrastructure supplied with power from the newly-constructed electricity substation within the Bus Éireann depot on Station Road, Athlone. Construction and installation work here was carried out by ESB Smart Energy Services. In preparing for the commencement of operations, Bus Éireann drivers and mechanics have undergone a comprehensive training programme – more than 500 hours – on the driving, maintenance and operation of the new buses which will deliver emission-free public transport. Speaking at the launch, Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan said: “The launch of these new electric town buses and the electrification of the Athlone depot is important on a number of fronts. It’s important because it will give Athlone town a new, quieter, cleaner bus service. It’s important because it’s the first of our 35 Pathfinder Projects to be delivered, just months after we first launched the programme last Autumn. And it’s important because it’s a sign of exciting things to come. “Driven by our new Climate Action Plan 2023, the future of Irish transport is on the cusp of radical change for the better. And that radical change will be driven by electricity – electric buses, electric cars, electric trains, powered for the most part by our own home-grown, cheaper renewable energy in the future. “I’m also delighted that this change is starting in Athlone because the other big difference afoot is the upscaling in rural transport that is happening. In 2022, we connected 67 new towns with buses and that number will continue to climb. I would like to commend Bus Eireann and the National Transport Authority for all the work they are doing across the country, and I look forward to many more bus services and depots going electric over the coming years.” CEO of the National Transport Authority Anne Graham said:The launch of these electric buses today represents a very significant milestone on the journey to a zero-emissions fleet for our town and city bus services. “From today the people of Athlone will benefit from buses that are cleaner, quieter, more comfortable and more attractive. “Athlone will be the first service in Ireland to be delivered entirely by electric buses, and we should not underestimate the significance of that for this town and for public transport in general. “The experience we gain here with our colleagues in Bus Éireann will doubtless stand us in good stead as NTA rolls out similar programmes in Dublin and in other cities and towns in the months and years ahead.” Stephen Kent, Chief Executive Officer, Bus Éireann said: “We’re delighted to see the launch of Ireland’s first all-electric town bus service in Athlone today, demonstrating the commitment and ambition of the Government, NTA and Bus Éireann to deliver transformative sustainable public transport services across the country. “This new fleet in Athlone is a particularly welcome development for Bus Éireann as we continue on our journey to become one of the most sustainable national transport companies in Europe. The operational experience will be invaluable as we expand electric vehicles to other urban services. ”We are excited to be operating the fleet, which will deliver a more modern, sustainable and comfortable service and provide an enhanced customer experience for passengers. A smoother and quieter ride is welcome as is improved access for persons with reduced mobility. “The all-electric Athlone service will help us to make real progress towards the ambitious goals we set out in our ‘Driving Change Sustainability Strategy, 2021-2030’ to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and to have half of our urban bus fleet transition to low and zero emission vehicles by the same time.” ENDS About NTA The National Transport Authority (NTA) is a statutory non-commercial body, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Transport.

       "  'text': 'Reliance on the private sector to deliver housing is a “vulnerability”, particularly with 2023 delivery targets coming under pressure, the Government’s spending department has said. Concerns about the challenges in housing and other areas are contained in a briefing document prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its new minister, Paschal Donohoe who took up the role in last month’s midterm rotation in Government. The Government department pointed to problems ahead in the year, saying that the overall 2023 target of 29,000 new housing units would be “challenging” to achieve due to high construction costs, capacity constraints, rising interest rates and disruptions in the supply chain. The department said structural issues such as planning, productivity and innovation, along with high construction costs, would “continue to challenge housing supply”. [ Irish house price growth slows to 8.6% ] [ Construction slows as inflation hits sector ] There was a 14 per cent year-on-year decline in new housing units commenced in the third quarter of 2022 and, if this downward trend continues, overall completions will fall, it said. It raised doubt around whether new schemes to address vacancy – a central plank in increasing supply – would deliver the scale of supply required, given that the schemes, including the Croí Cónaithe Towns grants initiative for derelict homes, were only recently introduced. The Government’s Housing for All strategy, launched in September 2021, commits to delivering 33,000 housing units on average every year, though experts warn significantly more units will be required to address chronic supply shortages in the housing crisis. The department said there were a significant number of uncommenced apartment planning permissions, some 43,000 apartments at the end of 2021, but there were viability issues around delivering housing through build-to-rent/sell and student accommodation schemes. [ Housing crisis ‘holding us back as a country’ and ‘causing intergenerational division’ - Taoiseach ] The “complex” design of the €450 million Croí Cónaithe scheme, aimed at delivering 5,000 apartments by 2025 in otherwise unviable developments, has “meant a lower-than-anticipated interest from developers” and is “likely too small” to address the scale of viability issues. It is estimated about 6,500 new social housing units will be delivered in 2023, some 2,500 units below target. Less than 1,000 affordable units are expected to be delivered for 2022. The department said the housing assistance payment (HAP) scheme – the main scheme to house the homeless – had reached its capacity due to constraints in the private rental market. This has resulted in fewer properties being available to accommodate homeless people and the problem has been exacerbated by large numbers of private landlords leaving the market. While the department said, in the 131-page briefing document, that the temporary ban on evictions would help manage homelessness during the winter, the longer-term consequences were “likely to negatively impact the rental market and deter investment in the rental sector”. “It is critical that the rental sector is reviewed, including an examination of options to curb further exits of landlords from the market,” the department said. [ Euro zone’s construction sector in worst decline since start of pandemic ] [ First 200 modular homes for Ukrainians expected by Easter ] In the response to accommodating people fleeing the war in Ukraine, the department said the Department of Education indicated that many of the excess places in schools for Ukrainian students had been “exhausted” and that further increases would require capital investment. The Department of Education said that, as of December 22nd last, 13,753 Ukrainian pupils had been enrolled in schools, including 8,823 in primary schools and 4,930 in secondary schools. It is “anticipating significant challenges” in finding enough places for 2023, particularly at post-primary level, due to continued arrivals, the relocation of existing Ukrainian students around the country and more than 1,000 students graduating from sixth class. “The department continues to work close with the Department of Children to, where possible, match new arrivals with existing school capacity,” it said. The overall State support provided in humanitarian supports for Ukrainian refugees is expected to be about €1 billion in 2022 and between €1.6 billion and €2.2 billion in 2023.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Pure fantasy to believe our GP numbers can handle free care',\n",
       "  'text': 'Sir — The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) has found that extending free GP care to everyone by 2026 can be done and would cost the State up to €881m. At that price, it sounds like a bargain — especially when you take into account the Government’s latest wheeze, to pay over €2.5bn to do remedial works on poorly built Celtic Tiger-era apartment blocks.I am acutely aware that free GP care is a key pillar of the Sláintecare health policy.However, I am bewildered as to how this will actually work in practice.At the moment, we have a population of more than five million people, but it is growing very fast. We also have about 4,000 active GPs in Ireland, but that number is reportedly going in the opposite direction.It seems to me that government proposals to extend GP care look lightweight.It has been widely reported that 25pc of GPs are over the age of 60, and this means more and more medical practices will in the future end up closing.I am left wondering whether there will be enough GPs left in this country to care for so many patients?It is my contention that the Government appears to be living in cloud cuckoo land if it believes the present and future medical workforce can actually cope with the chimera of having a free GP healthcare service.I would ask Health Minister Stephen Donnelly to explain clearly how this new free service is going to work, considering the paucity of GP practices operating currently in Ireland.Wasting time playing party political gamesSir — Ireland faces a multitude of very serious problems in areas such as (but not confined to) health, housing and homelessness. While I am apolitical, I am nevertheless perplexed and angry as to why some of our public representatives are instead focusing on a time-wasting exercise in pursuing Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe.The opposition would be better employed in trying to help solve some of the major problems facing us citizens. How much valuable Dáil time will be taken up this week just so the minister explains what can best be described as a non-event?I just wish our public representatives would for once act in a meaningful way on behalf of the electorate and stop playing their party political games.Quit throwing stones and get on with the jobSir — Certain politicians outraged at the perceived wrongdoing by Paschal Donohoe would do well to remember the biblical adage: “Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.”Any possibility that some of the frenetic energy expended on stone-throwing could be redirected towards resolving the hospital crisis, asylum-seekers’ accommodation, overspend on the Children’s Hospital, children suffering hugely while waiting for essential scoliosis surgery and the energy crisis?No doubt stone-throwing is fun, but it’s unproductive. Focus on real issues for once, please.\\u200bA rather odd take from Eamon RyanSir — Last week in the Dáil, the Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said he had a “similar perspective” to the Tánaiste in regard to Paschal Donohoe.“My sense is there are questions to be answered,” he said, adding that the place where this should be done was before the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo).He went on: “I think it’s difficult sometimes to do it in the Dáil because in a sense those asking the questions may have questions asked of them in turn.’’He seems to be implying that they should all circle the wagons, keep their heads down and say nothing because they have committed the same ‘offence’’.\\u200bStorm in a teacup while Rome burnsSir — Sitting at the kitchen table after he had blown out the two candles on his birthday cake (one in the shape of a 9, the other in the shape of a 1), I asked my dad his views on the recent “six men and a van” controversy surrounding Paschal Donohoe.His responses were “honest man”, “storm in a teacup”, “scandalous waste of Dáil time with the country and the world in a state of crisis”.At 91 years of age, my dad, who has seen it all before (and who is not an avowed Fine Gaeler), just hit the nail squarely on the head.\\u200bEthics in public office not taken seriouslySir — The applause for Damien English and Paschal Donohoe at last week’s FG TDs meeting demonstrates that the ruling parties do not take ethics and misconduct in public office seriously.The constant drip of scandal is having a corrosive effect on politics. Sipo’s powers require serious revision. But can politicians be up to the task when they have skin in the game?As the political class squabbled last week over a few thousand euro, and about who is the most virtuous (none of them), the same people handed out €2.5bn because of an incompetent, deceitful and greedy building industry. It is enough to make you throw your hands up in the air with despair.\\u200bWho now gets the job to fix faulty buildings?Sir — Housing Minster Darragh O’Brien’s newly announced redress scheme for faulty apartments built during the Celtic Tiger years will cost the taxpayer an estimated €2.5bn.The builders responsible, many of whom liquidated their companies and pocketed the profits from these defective buildings, were never held to account.Will these same builders and developers — many now operating under new company names — get the job of rectifying these faulty apartments?With the Government’s housing policy in a shambles, maybe this is just a simpler way of trying to appease voters.\\u200bHousing mandarin deserves more paySir — As a citizen, I was embarrassed to read the headline in last week’s paper regarding a pay dispute for the country’s top housing civil servant (Top housing civil servant fights for pay rise to €250k).It is regrettable that when we ask such post-holders to solve our housing crisis, we cannot benchmark their salary to industry norms.In the same issue, I read reports/advertisement from the private sector construction industry. I expect the chief of such enterprises earns more that €220,000 for their lesser roles.I hope the Government better remunerates the staff charged with resolving the housing crisis.\\u200bGAA must get to grips with hand passingSir — I watched a replay of this year’s All-Ireland minor hurling final on TG4 recently — a magnificent match. The skill level from both teams was fantastic. Tipperary showed wonderful class and spirit to come back to win against all the odds.Offaly are certainly going places with that team. Their skill was extraordinary. The backs’ defending was reminiscent of the great Offaly teams of the 1980s and ’90s. The scoring, particularly from the two corner forwards, was a joy to watch. However, there was a serious issue, highlighted on your letters page by former Tipperary All-Stars Conor O’Donovan and Michael Cleary regarding the ‘throwing’ of the ball, which took from the game, particularly in the first half.The referee totally ignored this persistent fouling, so the players understandably continued.While good suggestions were put forward by Michael and by another letter writer, John Manning, to disallow hand passes altogether, I feel that would be unworkable as teams would find it easier to ‘smother’ a player, which would lead only to further rucks.Conor’s suggestion, however, to disallow the hand pass from the holding hand would be far more practical and easier to monitor by referees. The ball can be passed or moved on quickly with the hurl or the other hand.Come on, rules committee of the GAA. Get to grips with this situation immediately and make this simple adjustment to the rules to eliminate this blot from our game.\\u200bScrum caps should be essential in rugbySir — I had the pleasure last week of watching some very entertaining rugby matches. It was great to see so many talented young players coming into the game. It was also very sad to see so many players with serious or permanent ear damage.It should be compulsory to wear good scrum caps with fitted ear protection for every level of rugby, male and female. If this were to happen in a sport involving animals such as race horses, there would be uproar.So why is it acceptable for rugby players?Cannabis no quick fix to mental health issueSir — I was dismayed to read your headline last week, “Snooker, soccer and cannabis jellies: How Lynn Ruane found way to beat burnout and pulled herself back from the brink.”The headline implies that using cannabis is an effective way to treat burnout and mental health problems.I am a psychiatrist who is concerned about the mental health of young people, and I believe headlines such as this ‘normalise’ the use of cannabis and provide a poor example to our youth.There is now a great deal of scientific evidence to show cannabis use is harmful to the developing brain, and the THC component can increase the risk of psychosis and suicidality.The cannabis jellies mentioned in this piece are particularly high in THC content and are responsible for many cases of accidental poisoning in children in the US and elsewhere.I certainly agree that exercise and social connectedness are effective in tackling burnout, but substance use is not a helpful strategy.\\u200bIt’s D-Day in Dáil for abundance of TDsSir — I applaud Denis Donohue’s Letter of the Week last Sunday, with his contribution on the excessive number of TDs in Dáil Éireann. Denis showed the number of TDs was a multiple of their equivalents in other European countries.If we cast the comparison net wider, our over-representation becomes more absurd.If India was to have the same proportion of national parliamentarians to its population as we have in the Dáil, it would require 45,052 parliamentarians instead of the present 552.They say all politics are local, and this is the reason for the 160 TDs we have. Perhaps an alternative approach would be a given budget for Dáil Éireann to include the salaries and expenses of its members.It would be interesting to see how the numbers would develop if the choice was between greater numbers with reduced pay or greater pay due to reduced numbers.Turkeys arriving to ‘DWTS’ right on cueSir — There are always a few turkeys on . This year is no different.Thankfully, last Sunday I was able to switch over to the BBC to watch the concluding frames of the Masters snooker, which was excellent entertainment. Mark Williams (47) was pipped at the post by his younger opponent, Judd Trump (33).A turkey may be able to give its younger, slimmer opponent a good run for their money in the snooker, but sadly not so in a dancing competition. The public generally keep the turkeys in the competition for their own amusement and get rid of them when they are tired of laughing at them.On the other hand, the Masters turkey may yet be champion in a future competition.\\u200bRyan needs garda to be in the frameSir — Rather than having a close protection garda accompanying Green Party leader Eamon Ryan by bicycle, surely the most efficient way of cutting down emissions would be if they shared a tandem?\\u200bBig freeze shows no sign of chilling outSir — We have had some week up here in Donegal. Beautiful, freezing snow. Every day we hoped: “It will never last.”\\u200bTop level of health service is a shamblesSir — The endless shambles in the HSE is a terrible reflection on management there and in the Department of Health.I would compare the health service position to the financial crisis at the end of the Noughties. Maybe the only way to deal with the problem is to close down the entire top level of the department and the HSE and replace them with proven international experts — in the same way as the late Brian Lenihan Jr brought in financial experts to sort out the financial crisis,I’d like to see Jim O’Callaghan appointed health minister.\\u200b‘Respectable’ tag for hunting ill-deservedSir — Justice Minister Simon Harris has strongly condemned the alleged ill-treatment of horses in a sulky race on the M3.While I’m sure he has a soft spot for horses, I wish he and his colleagues would show the same compassion towards the animals that suffer in the “respectable” pursuits of fox hunting and hare coursing.',\n",

       "  'text': 'WELCOME TO HOW I Spend My Money, a series on The Journal that looks at how people in Ireland really handle their finances. We’re asking readers to keep a record of how much they earn, what they save if anything, and what they’re spending their money on over the course of one week. Are you a spender, a saver or a splurger? We’re looking for readers who will keep a money diary for a week. If you’re interested send a mail to money@thejournal.ie. We would love to hear from you. Each money diary is submitted by readers just like you. When reading and commenting, bear in mind that their situation will not be relatable for everyone, it is simply an account of a week in their shoes, so let’s be kind. I’m a single parent due to separation. I work full-time in the public health system. I live outside Dublin because I can’t afford to live in Dublin where I’m from, and I commute to work in Dublin. I have one child, a daughter, who is the apple of my eye, and most of my decisions are based around her. I also try to pursue some of my own interests and a sedate social life! I’m mostly content with my situation but I do sometimes feel the burden of one income needing to cover everything, including savings! Especially when there are large unexpected expenses, like car trouble or a problem with something in the house, etc. I’m lucky that I have a reasonably good job and I can provide for us, but I studied and worked hard and made a lot of sacrifices to get where I am. I’d be interested to see if readers had any constructive advice for me. Occupation: Health and social care professional – half as a clinician and half as a team manager Age: 38 Location: The east of the country Salary: €63,000 Monthly pay (net): €3,555 Children’s allowance: €140 – saved each month Maintenance from my child’s father: €500, but he also pays for her activities, summer holidays and is generous at birthday and Christmas Total monthly income combined (net): €4,195 Monthly expenses Transport: €130 petrol €20 for parking in work Mortgage: €1100 Childcare: €455 approx (depends a bit on my working hours, etc) Household bills: Tv/phone/broadband – €99, gas/electricity – €110, bins – €15 approx Life insurance: €20 Income protection: €140 – this is very expensive insurance to have but I feel as a single parent I really need it Car insurance: €40 House insurance: €28 Cleaner: €130 per month or €32 per week Health insurance: €1,450 per year for me and €350 for my daughter. I pay it in full, but daughter’s father contributes half of hers, so cost to me is €120 per month although I don’t pay it like that Groceries: €500 Subscriptions: Netflix – €9, Disney + – €9, Google photos – €1.99 Charity: Oxfam – €15, Focus Ireland – €15 Savings: €400 towards car fund for when I need to change it, and separate €140 for my daughter. This is the children’s allowance saved every month for her future *** Monday 6.00 am: Alarm goes off. Up and prepare my daughter’s school lunch and my own lunch for work later. I try to eat healthily and save time and money at work by not going to the canteen. Unload the dishwasher, and hang out the washing that has been done overnight. 6.45 am: I do an online yoga class for an hour (€15). I wake my daughter before jumping in for a quick shower and get dressed for work. 8.00 am: Breakfast for both of us. Help my daughter get dressed and out the door for 8.30 am. I drop her to school at 8.45 (thank God it’s local!) and by 8.50 am I’m on the road to work. 9.30 am: Arrive at work. It’s always busy after the weekend! First thing I do is scan emails, then meet the team, see how everyone is fixed, any issues arising etc. The team I work with are great. We mostly get on with our own work but help each other out as needed. As a senior team member, as complications arise I’m pulled in to try to help them out which I’m glad to do. I spend the morning catching up on emails, planning and confirming arrangements for the week ahead. Healthcare is so dynamic, there can be rapidly changing schedules. 11.00 am: I grab a coffee in our staff room at no cost to me and eat a banana I brought from home. More emails, calls and meeting prep take me to lunchtime. Lunch is short, 20 mins whilst I eat my homemade soup and toasted sandwich I prepared this morning, and a quick social catch up with the team. 12.00 pm: The afternoon is busy with clinic appointments, which take the whole afternoon. There’s no time for an afternoon break. 5.00 pm: My brain is tired so I grab a quick coffee and eat three Cadbury roses from the staff room. Bad habit really shortly before dinner, but I feel like I need an energy boost. I tend to further emails/final calls of the day. 5.45 pm: I finish up. Thankfully the worst of the traffic is gone so I get home quickly, stopping at the childminder to pick up my daughter at 6.20 pm. 6.30 pm: Home and I reheat dinner for both of us. Leftover chicken and broccoli bake I made at the weekend. Tidy up after dinner, check daughter’s homework (which is not much thankfully) to ensure it’s done properly, check her lunchbox to make sure lunch is eaten (it is!) 7.15 pm: I spend a while playing with my daughter before getting her ready for bed. Phone my sister for a chat afterwards. We make plans to try to meet up at the weekend. 8.00 pm: I watch a bit of telly whilst simultaneously scrolling through my phone, and messaging some friends. 10.30 pm: I’m tired so head to bed and listen to a podcast. Today’s total: €15.00 Tuesday 6.30 am: Time to get up. No yoga this morning, so I shower, get dressed, etc and prepare lunches for both of us. 7.00 am: I prepare dinner by putting it in the slow cooker on low. It’ll be on for 9-10 hours whilst I’m out at work. Fold and put away clothes that were drying overnight. I try to minimise what needs ironing because I pay someone to do it – this might sound like a luxury to others, but I just don’t have time to do everything myself! 7.45 am: Wake my daughter to get her ready for school. Thankfully she’s pretty good at getting up and getting ready in the morning. My daughter needs €14 for books she selected from the recent book fair at school. I also Revolut a colleague €10 (we are sending flowers to another colleague who had a baby recently). 8.30 am: Drop my daughter to school. Traffic is heavy this morning, so I’m going to be late for work! 9.30 am: I’m late for a meeting that I have started by phone from the car (thank God for Bluetooth and virtual meeting options). This is not how I like to start the day! 9.45 am: I get to work and join the meeting in person. 11.00 am: Finish the meeting and go grab a coffee in the staff room with the team. Catch up on their issues and try troubleshooting with them. 11.30 am: Finally get to my office and work on a project that’s on a tight deadline. 1.30 pm: Where did the last two hours go? I go to the staff room to get my lunch of smoked salmon and avocado on a toasted bagel, followed by a yoghurt. This was all bought during the weekly shop. Have a team meeting this afternoon, so I get takeout teas and coffees for the team. I do this the odd time, they all work so hard. Cost is €21.75! 3.00 pm: After our meeting, I spend the rest of the afternoon returning calls and emails that have piled up, and working on some of my projects. There’s a lot going on in healthcare at the moment with endless asks for inputs on different things. 5.00 pm: Leave work and collect my daughter from the childminder on the way home. We also stop to buy bread (€1.80) for school lunches for the remainder of the week. 6.00 pm: Get home. Herself is delighted with books from the book club and can’t wait to show me! I get the smell of bolognese in the slow cooker as soon as we enter the kitchen – yum. Quickly cook some spaghetti with extra for lunch tomorrow and check her homework and lunchbox – all ok. 6.30 pm: Eat dinner and tidy up afterwards. 7.00 pm: Watch some kids’ TV with my daughter. It’s mind-numbing, but she loves it when I watch this stuff with her. I simultaneously go online to do weekly grocery shopping for delivery on Friday (€111.24). It might sound a lot for such a small household but I do some batch cooking to stock up the freezer, etc and also all cosmetics, cleaning products and the like are included. 7.45 pm: After TV, we begin one of the new books at bedtime. That’s an incentive to get up to bed early! She is asleep by 8.30 pm this eve. 9.00 pm: I decide to have a bath to relax. 9.30 pm: Watch some Netflix. 10.30 pm: Head to bed and lights out for 11 pm. Today’s total: €158.79 Wednesday 6.00 am: I get up and do my online yoga class (€15). 7.00 am: Get my daughter up, shower and dress, etc. My daughter does an art class directly after school today and another mother of a child in her class collects her and brings her back to their house for a play. This is a huge help to me as it eliminates a day’s childcare for me. Although her childminder is excellent and very flexible, the cost really adds up. Little things like that make a big difference to me. I will try to get out of work a bit early today not to take advantage of the other parent’s generosity, and at Christmas I’ll gift them some wine or chocolates. 9.30 am: Drop herself to school and at work for 9.30 am. Full-on day of meetings and working on various projects, consulting with the team, etc. 1.00 pm: I heat up my spag bol and eat at my desk and work through lunch as I’ll leave about 4 pm today. 1.30 pm: After lunch, I treat myself to a cappuccino (€3.75). I also buy a birthday card and stamp to send to a friend (€4.55). It’s also my father’s birthday soon, so I order some aftershave for him (€120). My sister will probably go halves with me but I haven’t checked, and we’ll take him out for lunch on the day. I make an appointment to see my GP as I require a routine blood test for some medication I’m on. 4.45 pm: Something came up and I don’t get out of work as early as I’d hoped I would. Traffic is bad and I stop for petrol on the way (€62.47). 5.30 pm: I finally collect my daughter from her friend’s house and we get home soon after. She has been fed chicken dippers and chips. She didn’t get to finish her art work in art class and is keen to finish this now. She asks me to do some artwork too. I join in because I know how much she loves it when I do things with her, and I have the constant guilt of not having enough time with her. 7.00 pm: I make an omelette for myself and some French toast for her. I give her a bath before bed, which she also loves, and I feel like we’ve had some quality time together this evening. 8.30 pm: She’s in bed and ready to fall asleep. I phone a friend who has been asking my advice about job applications, etc. She is looking to change sectors. This call takes over an hour. It’s good to chat and to try to offer some advice to others. She says we should meet up soon for dinner and drinks which I’d like. We’re both busy working mums, it might take some weeks to get this arranged! 10:00 pm: I watch some Netflix, drink tea and eat chocolate before going to bed too late at 11.30 pm. Today’s total: €205.77 Thursday 6.00 am: I’m up and prepping for the day ahead. I’m attending a conference today and have to travel to it, so I need to be away early. 7.00 am: I wake my daughter, get her dressed and drop her to the childminder half an hour later, where she’ll have breakfast and watch TV before going to school. I’m on the train by 8 am. 9.00 am: I get to the conference for welcome tea and coffee. The conference is great but exhausting, very full on, but meet lots of interesting people. All tea, coffee and lunch included and work will pay for my parking and train ticket there. 4.30 pm: It’s been a long day. There’s a wine reception after the conference which I’d love to stay for, but can’t and actually need to leave a little early as I’ve to get home. It’s a very long day for my daughter being with the childminder both before and after school. 5.00 pm: I tend to a few work emails on the train journey home. Collect daughter at 6.15 pm who has had dinner I sent to childminder – leftover spaghetti bol. I will need to pay the childminder a bit extra this week for the longer hours. I’m very lucky she is so flexible. 6.30 pm: We arrive home. The cleaner has come today (she has a key) and I just remotely turn off the alarm and reset when she’s done. I Revolut her €32 for two hours’ work. She is a godsend, the house is sparkling! 7.00 pm: Play with my daughter for a bit, then put her to bed by 8 pm. 8.30 pm: I make myself a toasted sambo with crisps and tea as a snack (I had big lunch at the conference) and eat that whilst watching some Netflix. 10.00 pm: Tired after a long day, so I head up to bed. Today’s total: €32.00 Friday 7.00 am: I get up, prep lunches for my daughter and me, get my daughter up, etc. 8.30 am: I head to my GP appointment, the first appointment of the day. Thankfully it runs on time as I have my daughter with me and need to get her into school! Just bloods and repeat prescription so only €30 at GP, but I know the prescription will cost me €56. 8.50 am: Get my daughter to school just in the nick of time and I’m on the road to work. 9.30 am: Have a clinic this morning but shouldn’t be too busy. Intermittently popping to the office to follow up on other tasks too and grab a quick coffee and scone (brought with me) to keep me going. I take half day annual leave today – I do this occasionally to facilitate a play date. My daughter gets invited to way more than I can return due to working full time, but I think other parents are generally understanding of this. 1.30 pm: I leave work on time to collect my daughter and two friends from school. 3.00 pm: Get home with the three kids and they immediately go up to her room to play. I love having kids in the house, and to be honest, they’re all good kids although I’m supervising, because they’re happily occupied, I tend to get some of my own things done around the house. Tesco online delivery arrives and I put it away. I also make a big batch of soup that I will use for some work lunches during the week and I’ll freeze some, while the girls are ‘doing art’ at the kitchen table. 4.30 pm: I put pizza on for them, and me. They have theirs in a den they built with couch cushions, blankets etc. House is messy but I know this is a good play for them and won’t last forever! 6.30 pm: Their parents pick them up as my daughter has swim lesson this eve. It’s not great timing, but she’s one of those kids who was affected by the Covid delay in getting to start swimming lessons and there is a huge demand for a place in lessons for her age so I had to just take what I could get. It’s paid for by term (€140) so no cost today, and her father usually pays for this and other after-school activities. 8.00 pm: Home from swimming and dry daughter’s hair and get her ready for bed, do a few stories, etc. It’s been a long day. 8.30 pm: I’m really tired myself. I phone my sister and my father and we make plans to meet on Sunday. 9.00 pm: I go to bed early and read. Today’s total: €86.00 Saturday 9.15 am: Bit of a lie on this morning. I have a leisurely breakfast of pancakes and smoothies. 11.00 am: I bring my daughter to a ballet lesson paid for by her father. I sometimes go for a walk while this is on but today I just sit in the car and catch up on some life admin. 12.00 pm: After ballet, I meet a friend and her two kids in a cafe for a quick hot chocolate for the kids, and cappuccinos for mummies. We each pay our own way – €7.90 for me. We go to a local playground for a while but it’s really cold so we don’t stay too long. 1.30 pm: I head home with my daughter and we have a late lunch of sausage sandwiches! Just some downtime then till her father comes to collect her at 3 pm. He will take her overnight until around 2.30 pm tomorrow. He works abroad a lot so we don’t have a regular schedule of when he sees her, it depends on his work etc. She is due to attend a birthday party from 12-2 pm tomorrow in a play centre. He will bring her but I send her off with the birthday present wrapped (€15) and card (€1), as I wouldn’t rely on him to organise this. 3.15 pm: After my daughter leaves, I actually go to bed and set my alarm for an hour’s time – I’m that tired from the week, I feel I need it as girls’ night out planned this eve. 4.30 pm: Get up, shower and get ready to go out tonight. I always try to utilise time like tonight to have a social life, so I’ve arranged to meet my group of friends I trained in college with. There are six girls in total who maintained a friendship for years. 6.00 pm: I drive over to my friend’s house because I’ll stay with her tonight. I stop on the way to pick up a bottle of wine (€12.50) so I don’t arrive empty handed. We have a glass of wine that was meant as a gift to my friend, and then her husband drops us into town. 8.00 pm: We meet the others for cocktails before dinner. Two cocktails (€30). We go for dinner after (€70 each with drinks and tip). We debate going for another drink after, but really we’ve had enough and get a taxi home. My friend insists on paying. I must remember to get her back another time. 12.30 am: Flop into bed for sleep with no alarm clock, bliss! Today’s total: €136.40 Sunday 9.00 am: It’s bliss not having to get up when I wake up! I doze on and off till 10.30 am when I can hear my friend and her husband up. I get up and have breakfast with them. 11.00 am: Quick shower and head home. I don’t hang around as I’ve things to do and don’t want to impinge on their plans for the day. 12.00 pm: I get home and tidy up my house a bit – unload the dishwasher, put on washing, etc. I start to prepare for dinner. My father and sister will come over later this afternoon for dinner for my father’s birthday, which is actually tomorrow but we won’t get to celebrate then. I remember I have no birthday cake for him. I think about chancing some baking with herself when she gets home, which she loves to do, but then I think that I’ll be too pushed for time to do that. 1.00 pm: I nip out to a local shop to buy a cake (€6.95) and a card (€3.45). 1.30 pm: I head home, wrap the aftershave bought earlier in the week. My sister has Revoluted me €60 for the aftershave and will bring a bottle of wine with her, although no one will drink much, maybe a small glass each. If I hadn’t drunk so much last night I might have had an extra glass when I’m sitting down tonight after my daughter is in bed, but I know I won’t feel like it, as last night was enough alcohol for me. 2.40 pm: My daughter is dropped home with a party bag and full of sugar of course. She’s in good form after the party. She forgot granddaddy and her auntie were coming over. She sets about making a birthday card for him and wants to have a present herself for him. I didn’t anticipate this. I give her a large bar of chocolate already bought as part of weekly shop, and this suffices for her. We chat while I prepare dinner and she makes birthday card for grandad. 4.00 pm: Our guests arrive and we have dinner around an hour later. It’s great to have family round, it livens the place up a bit and they fuss over my daughter and she’s delighted to see them. We do cake after dinner and my daughter has to have a go blowing out the candles too. We just chat and catch up and mark the passing of another year. My mother died a few years ago so we’re all aware that life is to be celebrated. 7.15 pm: My father and sister leave and I go bathe my daughter and get her ready for bed. She’s in bed by 8.30 pm, clothes and uniform ready for the morning. 9.00 pm: I watch a bit of Netflix, send some messages and do too much scrolling before deciding to head to bed for 11 pm. Today’s total: € 10.40 Weekly subtotal: €644.36 – €60 back from my sister €584.36, but approx €200 of this (petrol, cleaner, groceries) is accounted for in my monthly budget *** What I learned - Some days my expenditure is surprisingly high. This week there was a birthday present for my father and a GP visit, but in reality, there’s something additional every week! I was so glad all went ok with my daughter’s father re Saturday night. If I had to pay a babysitter €10 per hour, it almost makes a night out prohibitively expensive, or I may have cancelled. I feel like I spend a lot on various ‘insurance’ but I consider them all necessary in my circumstances, and I have shopped around for better deals but I reckon I’m on a decent price for the cover I have. I really hate wasting food with so much food poverty and I make a conscious effort to ensure very little if any food goes in the bin in my house. I try to get the balance between spending and saving and also distinguish from essential expenditure and luxury expenditure with a night out, there was some of that here but it is needed at times. I would love to work part-time but I really can’t afford to. There always seems to be something else to pay for. That said, I think it’s good for my daughter to see her mother working and feel I’m a role model for that for her. I had the opportunity for a good education and it’s being put to use and I’m able to support myself thankfully. I’d love to be able to save a bit more and have more disposable income for holidays and clothes, etc, but overall I feel I’m managing ok. I also sometimes think about investing money rather than just saving, but I really can’t afford to lose it, and I’m clueless about this issue. I’ll be interested to see if readers have any helpful tips for me, especially anyone in a similar situation.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Expect more of the same, only with more urgency in the final stretch of this Dáil term, according to the Dublin Bay South TD and long-time leader of the Green Party. “We are in a very good place in terms of doing a lot of the work in the last two years to set things up,” he says. “We have a very good climate law which we introduced a year and a half ago. Last summer, we set up sectoral targets of specific ambition in energy and transport and agriculture, and so on. And then, only a month ago, it became really more detailed, a real plan in terms of how we have to deliver it. “So for me, it’s all about delivery. Firstly we don’t have any choice. Failure is not an option because of the nature of this Irish law but also the reality of European law and European policies that are perhaps even more ambitious, in terms of scale and speed, and need for change. “Also, I would argue this is going to be good for the country. It’s not a hardship, it’s a positive development, and solutions on the climate side will be good for us. “It will be good for security, it will be good for creating employment, it’s good for Irish agriculture.” Mr Ryan concedes the level of change needed will be difficult. Change is never easy, especially the scale of this change. I think in the next two years, it’s all about delivery — housing and health reform as well as climate “They are connected because what we do in housing can and will be good for climate if we got it right. Absolutely.” Retrofitting One such challenge that brings together climate targets, housing, and health into one strand is that of retrofitting homes. There has been criticism of the slow progress so far, despite lofty ambitions and targets up to the end of the decade. The Government announced a national retrofitting scheme last February at a cost of €8bn, which aims to upgrade 75,000 homes every year from 2026 to 2030, with an overall target of 500,000. According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) at the end of October, more than 36,000 applications were received by it across its schemes, and all are experiencing significant levels of demand from homeowners. This equates to approximately 28,800 homes being retrofitted, the SEAI said. Homeowners typically have a period of eight months to complete works once approved, and there are constraints on delivery at the present time, it added. There are different schemes, which has led to confusion among homeowners and political figures alike as to the application process, while fewer than two dozen firms are actually hired or in the process of being hired to carry out the works — an enormous workload for such a small pool. Mr Ryan defended the pace of the national retrofitting programme, saying it has been only running for less than a year. “It’s starting to deliver. We did deliver on what our targets were. We delivered last year around 27,000 upgrades. Minister for Higher Education, Simon Harris, was telling me that we are seeing a huge increase in training and apprenticeships, about 2,000 have applied. You talk to people in the industry — they’re flat out, they’ve never been busier. The great thing about the national retrofitting programme we introduced last February is that they know the money is there for the next 10 years. They [firms] can invest, they can hire, they can go out and promote confidence that the funding will be there and that the political commitment is there. He defended the low number of ‘one-stop shops’ assigned by the SEAI to carry out the retrofitting programme. Mr Ryan said: “They are ramping up, and they’re not small firms — this is the likes of ESB and Scottish and Southern (SSE) — they’re not companies without scaling up capabilities. It does take time. “Last year was only the start, it was always a warming up. We have delivered roughly the scale and speed that we expected. We will go this year to 37,000 houses being upgraded, and up again the year after that. It’s delivering, the way I see it.” Infrastructure The glacial pace of planning of key infrastructure around the country is frustrating, the Environment and Transport Minister acknowledged. Housing and transport are the casualties, despite being huge social issues, he added. “We’re not moving fast enough, that is clear. I’ll give you an example. If you look at any assessment, it’s taken us roughly 10 years on the current system to deliver a bus corridor. It’s probably taking about 20 years to deliver a railway line, and similar in housing. It’s our biggest problem. “We have a lot of projects now that have had planning permission but they’re not being built. So we need speed in so many different areas and quicker changes. Sustainable transport “One of the things we’re doing is sustainable mobility in the transport side. We set up a task force to look at how we can accelerate everything. We’re focusing very much on the next three years. “I’ve rang every county council manager around the country, all 42 councils. I said to the managers, ‘can you give me examples of projects we could deliver in the next three years?’ I said we’ll fund them and we’ll make sure that it gets real attention to try and get through planning, to try and get all the support the State can give to make it happen.” It led to around 70 applications, he said. “We have picked 35 on a scientific basis in terms of the ones we think are most demonstrative projects and so on. And it’s all about how do we deliver the next three years. So for example, in Limerick, putting a train station in Moyross because there we’ve got huge areas of State land where we could put in new housing if we had a good public transport system. So build it. “In Waterford, move the railway line and station and suspension bridge — and these things are happening now — so that you develop the north quays, the Ferrybank side. “That is a housing as well as a transport development project. “In Galway city, to deliver the cross-city bus route that would start to address the chronic transport problems that they have, everyone living on one side of the city and working on the other side and having a real difficulty kind of making the city function. They’re just some of the examples.” If some local authorities can’t deliver, the department will move on to one that will, he warned. “If councils feel they can’t do it and they won’t do it — because these are difficult, a lot of decisions such as Galway are going to be difficult because it means taking road space and giving priority to buses and cycling and walking, and that can be controversial — we will say ‘OK, fine, we’ll take that project out and we’ll provide that funding to another council to do something else instead’. “We need to incentivise councils to act fast because the truth is that for a variety of complex reasons, including our planning system, complication in that and so on, it takes too long. “By taking such length of time, it’s costing the public a lot more, not only in terms of increased cost of construction, but also the loss in having better transport infrastructure better local community, better housing, more housing.” Forestry The minister has acknowledged the anger over plans by State-owned commercial forestry body Coillte to sell thousands of acres of rural Ireland to British investment fund Gresham House as part of an afforestation deal. “I do understand the disquiet. I think we have to really focus on how we get forestry right, not only in the number of hectares that we grow, but the type of forestry for better biodiversity as well as storage of carbon. “One of the real constraints here is around a decision by the European Commission back in 2003, which said that Coillte couldn’t avail of the grants and premiums that apply in afforestation. And it’s very hard without those grants and premiums because there’s significant upfront costs, and you’re competing with others who will be able to access those premiums.” Mr Ryan said he will consult with Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Pippa Hackett, on the European Commission implications. “I know she probably will agree with me on this, we should go further and I know her department and Coillte have already started questioning with the European Commission whether there a variation on that state aid rule, which would allow us invest in our land, Coillte to invest in a forestation in a way that doesn’t fall afoul of the European legislation. “That would transform what’s possible.” There is also a need to look at other funding mechanisms including State funding to develop forestry which is closer to nature, with much more emphasis on biodiversity rather than timber production, he said. “That’s happening, and Coillte has committed 50% of their afforestation and developments to be in that type of forestry. And that’s the one that I think we really need to focus on and deliver and develop at scale.” Such plans have started, albeit on a small scale, he said. “Scaling that up, I think is one of the things that where, with environmental movements and others, there is real agreement.” The forestry programme agreed by Government in November and the €1.3bn behind it is also vital, he said. “It is all directed at getting farmers to plant land and to promote agroforestry and the use of riparian forestry strips within farms that have real benefits in improving the local environment, providing the farm with a steady supply of timber for its own needs, and also really restoring biodiversity as well as storing carbon.” Agricultural emissions Mr Ryan and his party have come under sustained fire from sectors of agriculture since entering Government, with some perceiving the Greens to be stifling traditional farming. The Green Party is an ally of farmers, Mr Ryan insisted. “My sense is that there’s real change happening in Irish farming. Since the Greens have been in government, there has been a threefold increase in the amount of organic farming and its only going further up, particularly with the high price of fertiliser in the last few years. “There is huge interest in farming and, similarly, if you look at the number of farmers who have applied for this new environmental scheme, the Acres Scheme, it is way above anything previously. So I think the narrative of farmers versus the environment is wrong. The reality, what’s happened on the ground is farmers are realising this is the future. “This is where the income is. This can use their skills in a way that’s really beneficial and productive. And it’s happening — we’re seeing the numbers climbing from environmental schemes and agriculture, organic schemes, that we’ve never seen before. I think we’ll see the same in forestry, particularly with the much higher premiums that are applying for those sorts of environmentally sensitive farming systems. I expect them to take off.” Public support Mr Ryan said he believes the Irish people “want to play their part” and “won’t turn their back” on so-called climate refugees. Integration Minister Roderic O'Gorman said earlier this month that the asylum system will have to be expanded to include a new category for people fleeing the effects of climate change — comments which former justice minister Charlie Flanagan criticised as “making policy on the hoof”. In relation to climate refugees, Mr Ryan said: “I think the Irish people have a real sense of understanding and a sense of care for what is happening in the world — for playing our role, small as we are. We can’t solve all the world’s problems, we’re not responsible for doing so, but I think by and large that the Irish people want to play their part proportionately and fairly.” He rebuffed Mr Flanagan’s comment. “The chair of the Oireachtas foreign affairs committee [Mr Flanagan] may have misunderstood what was said, and certainly I don’t think it is correct what he said about “policy on the hoof” in how we manage climate refugees. “What Roderic said is clearly and absolutely correct. This is something that must be considered at an international level, particularly Europe. We don’t decide this on our own, it is decided as part of international agreements, and rightly so.” Ireland “has to manage it”, Mr Ryan said, adding that he was personally affected listening to Pakistan’s environment minister speaking about last year’s devastating floods, described as the most damaging in its history. “The truth is that we are already starting to see, for example, in Pakistan last year — up to 30m affected. I met the Pakistani minister at Cop27 in Egypt, and it was heartfelt and heartrending when you heard the scale of destruction that occurred. “Climate change is everywhere. You can’t ignore it and you can’t stop it. We will manage it as part of an international effort. We’re not like Atlas carrying the world on our shoulder but I think Irish people want to play their part, and want to be part of a world where we start to care for the environment and to care for the planet. Where those consequences are inevitable, we won’t turn our back.”\",\n",

       "  'text': 'When Weston Clendinning moved from Co Armagh to London in the hope of furthering his music career, he hadn’t expected it to take several months to find somewhere to live. The 26-year-old singer and guitarist moved over with a friend in September 2021, with his car, not realising it would in fact become their home for at least a month. “We basically ate at Wetherspoons every day,” he laughs. Clendinning had already spent months looking for places online but thought he hadn’t been successful in finding somewhere due to not being available for viewings. “We viewed endless amounts of houses and we ended up offering places six months in advance and they were still turning us down,” he says. “We eventually found a one-bed flat in Fulham, where we had to pay six months upfront, I slept on the kitchen floor, and my friend slept in the bedroom.” Clendinning isn’t the only Irish expat who has found themselves in this situation. Private rents in the United Kingdom are growing at the fastest annual rate since 2016, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). London has been hit the hardest, with the median monthly rent in the capital now nearly twice that of the rest of England. According to property site Rightmove, the average advertised rent in London is now £2,343 (€2,674) a month. According to flat sharing website Spareroom there are now seven renters for every room available in London. Rising rents coupled with people returning to the city following the pandemic has fuelled London’s housing crisis. “It took my girlfriend about five or six months for her and her sister to get somewhere and she was on the verge of having to quit her job and move back because she couldn’t get accommodation,” Clendinning says. “The prices were through the roof. You had two girls that both had normal jobs making £30,000 a year salary [and] weren’t making the threshold to find anywhere semi-liveable. “They had to ask for help to get six months rent upfront before they eventually found somewhere where they’re now having to pay £2,500 a month for a normal enough house.” Cost-of-living crisis Finding accommodation isn’t the only issue in the city, the cost-of-living crisis has also made life in London less accessible for many Irish expats. Emma McManus (28) from Leixlip, Co Kildare, says she is unable to save at all at the moment and is terrified to put the heating on. “You’re more hyperalert, I guess,” she says. “I’m also not able to fly home as much as I used to. The flights aren’t as cheap as they used to be, you’re looking at an extra £100 in a month if you’re wanting to fly home.” McManus, who works for an ending violence against women and girls charity, says her sector is poorly paid but they are not in it for the money. That said, she has seen many colleagues with families struggling. “We’re supporting our clients who are financially abused, in hardship and poverty, we’re getting them foodbank vouchers and things like that but then we’re having to do the same ourselves. Some of my colleagues are having to go to foodbanks as well, especially those who have kids.” However, although the price of living in London is a concern, McManus said the city is full of opportunity. “The cost-of-living crisis is showing how low paid people are and how we actually need to stand up in solidarity. There’s a bit of social change happening with it too which I think will be positive long term.” Living from pay cheque to pay cheque Kate Gunnar (29), from Co Kilkenny, says she moved to Tooting in June 2021 for a change of scenery but was shocked by how expensive it is to live there. “I was a primary school teacher and taught in Dublin for three years but I wanted something different,” she says. When she first moved to the capital she did some supply teaching and office administration before landing a HR role at an Irish construction company. “I signed my contract on a really low salary of £28,000 thinking it would be okay. It was fine for the first few months but then in April things started to go up, like our electricity bill. “I wasn’t even spending money on socialising, it was just getting the Tube into work and that was costing me around £250 a month. I was continuously going into my overdraft and I had even saved up a bit from teaching. I was considering moving back to Ireland as things weren’t feasible.” Gunnar eventually changed jobs and is now working for a law firm for a better salary. “Going up in salary has helped so much, I feel I can breathe again,” she says. “I never want to be in that situation again going from pay cheque to pay cheque. The opportunities are keeping me here and the social life in London, however, I’m not sure how much longer I will stay here. If someone was moving over now I would tell them they would need to be on a good graduate salary.” ‘London has more to offer than Dublin’ Mark Byrne (29), a charity worker from Dublin moved to Croydon in March 2022, after stints working in Calais and the Balkans. “I was living in Dublin till 2019, then I chose to leave to go volunteering as I was finding it too difficult to live there with the rental crisis,” he says. “I thought I would try to go travelling and find my feet somewhere else and then the pandemic hit. After Calais, my girlfriend and I both moved to London.” Byrne now works for Refugee Support in London and questions his move but says the city brings a lot more opportunities for his line of work. “I do question my move to London because I left Dublin as it was so expensive and I couldn’t find somewhere to live properly. Now I’ve ended up going to London which is equally expensive and it’s still hard to find places to live. “I feel I’ve made a bit of a lateral move. In London, in this line of work that I do, there’s definitely a lot more available over here than in Ireland. With this sector of work, salaries are a bit lower so there is also the financial struggle that goes with getting to work in what you like but being in a very expensive city. London has more to offer than Dublin in terms of things to do, [but] I still prefer Dublin culture.” Meanwhile, Clendinning is adamant that there is no place like London for new opportunities as a musician. “I love London from a music perspective, there are so many people there trying to be the best they can be musically. It seems to attract a lot of passionate people.” Since his move, he recorded at Eastcote Studios in Kensal Town with a producer who has worked with the Coronas and Razorlight. “At Eastcote studios it’s wonderful to be immersed in that kind of environment, to be surrounded by people with the same dreams. Not only that but people who have lived their dreams. I’m still very much a dreamer.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'The world of work has undergone significant changes in recent years. The pandemic-induced move to remote working has spurred a worldwide shift in how we view and do our jobs , with many companies now allowing home working on a full-time or part-time basis forever more. In addition, advancing technologies means the needs of the labour force are constantly changing and evolving. While twenty years ago many young people were able to gain employment without a university degree, things have changed completely, with some jobs now requiring at least a Master’s Degree. While these changes might seem frightening, they can create new and exciting opportunities for students and graduates who see these trends in advance and upskill in these areas. Leo Clancy, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, said there is significant demand for employees trained in sustainability, climate and agritech in the State, as the country — and the world — seeks to become more proactive in terms of climate action. Digital technologies continue to be strong performers in the workforce too, he said, such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, data science and robotic engineering. Mr Clancy said the “biggest underlying challenge” for businesses is meeting the labour and skills needs. While that creates a challenge for the companies themselves, “therein lies our opportunity” for those preparing to enter the workforce, he said . Maureen Lynch, operations director at Hays Ireland recruitment agency, said current indications suggest that all specialist areas will be recruiting in the coming years, such as technology, finance, banking, construction, engineering and life sciences. “However, the requirements will evolve as will the technical elements of these specialist areas. Never has it been truer that we are now living in a world of lifelong-learning,” she said. As a result, the key to carving out a successful career in this evolving landscape is to try to understand the needs of a marketplace and align training to meet those needs. But how is one to do that? We’ve compiled some ideas of resources that would help a student who is trying to ascertain what jobs will be available around the time of their graduation. Media Reading widely has many benefits, but especially when it comes to determining upcoming changes in the workplace. Often specialised journalists pick up on emerging trends earlier than an average person, with many publications having specific sections on the economy, jobs market and issues arising for businesses. The trick with getting the most out of media is to read across many different publications, both national and international. Harvard Business Review is a good online resource, while the likes of The Guardian, The New York Times and The Irish Times often report on the workplace and labour market trends. There are also some specialist publications that can provide niche information. For example, Made in Ireland is a bi-monthly magazine on technological innovation, news and the latest developments in the engineering and manufacturing sectors. It would be an invaluable resource for those seeking to build a long-term career in the area. Jobs listings Most jobs are now advertised online, making it easier than ever to see what work is on offer. There are so many websites specifically for advertising employment opportunities, such as Indeed.com, jobs.ie or monster.ie. If you keep an eye on the postings, you might notice emerging trends. For example, a quick look on one of the websites shows a number of advertisements for engineers and senior management roles. OECD The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) website features an iLibrary on its website that provides invaluable insight on employment figures and labour market changes across a wide variety of regions, from Europe to Australia or Canada. Particularly beneficial if a student is considering pursuing work abroad after graduation, it provides research, ebooks, articles and publications offering insights to gauge global demand for certain skills or occupations. The Central Statistics Office The CSO publishes quarterly labour force surveys that feature comprehensive detail on the world of work in Ireland. While documenting the numbers in employment and unemployment, it also analyses which sectors have an increasing number of employees in active work, and which have decreasing levels of productivity. According to the most recent publication, from quarter three in 2022, employment growth was particularly strong in sectors such as construction, accommodation, and food and education. In terms of more specific occupations, there was an increase in those employed in professional occupations, skilled trades— such as chefs or construction workers — and personal services such as care workers. Pay Money is obviously a big influencing factor when deciding what job to take and what field to go into. If youare interested in figuring out just how much you could earn in a job after graduation, the website payscale.com could be of assistance. The website enables users to research and compare average salaries for various roles and get a snapshot of current market wages in Ireland through online tools and software. Recruitment Agencies Those who are consistently asked to fill roles know exactly what employers are looking for. Ireland has a myriad of recruitment agencies, many of whom send out insights via email or social media. It is worth either subscribing to those updates, following their online accounts or t contacting the agencies directly to see what information they might be able to provide to you about the jobs landscape. Ms Lynch said that, for example, Hays Ireland has a blog on its website that is regularly updated with “the latest information about emerging prospects in the world of work”. Networking Meeting people and talking to them is almost always the best way to learn new things. Schools tend to invite speakers in for sixth years, so they can hear more about universities or places of work. In university, there are often conferences organised. Students should attend these and try to speak with the guest speakers after. Ms Lynch said graduates and students should talk to as many people as possible within their preferred field. “This will give you a greater understanding of the reality of a role, the career prospects, challenges and opportunities in a given career. Critically, it will also help you grow your professional network, something that will always stand to you later on in your career,” she said. “The good news is that most people are happy to help and make themselves available for a coffee or a Zoom call.” Social media Social media dominates almost all other aspects of our lives, so it’s really no wonder that it can play a role in the workplace too. LinkedIn is probably the most obvious platform that ties into work. Request to connect with people working in industries in which you might like to pursue a career, see what they post and if they highlight any issues or opportunities. This interconnectivity shows the need to ensure that a student’s LinkedIn profile is up-to-date, professional and accurate, Ms Lynch added. Solas The State agency responsible for overseeing the further education and training sector in Ireland, Solas often works with the National Skills Council. The council regularly puts out skills bulletins, which are easily accessible online. The bulletins give a labour market overview, employment permits, vacancies and profiles of various occupational employment profiles.',\n",

       "  'text': 'With unemployment levels at record lows, there are lots of reasons for students transitioning from second to third-level education to feel confident about their career prospects when they finally take that leap into the jobs market. Notwithstanding the many issues facing young people nowadays – not least the seemingly impossible prospect of someday owning a home – getting on the job ladder has scarcely ever seemed more manageable. But what can the students embarking on the start of third-level education today expect when that day finally arrives? The first thing to say, according to Sharon McCooey, head of LinkedIn Ireland, is that “the only certainty in life is uncertainty”, as she points to events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war in recent years. “The first piece of advice I give anyone thinking about what course to study at university is that many job opportunities available today are very different from a decade ago,” she says. “What students need to keep in mind is that they are at the beginning of a journey of lifelong learning. Key to that journey is an adaptable mindset as the reality is today’s graduates are likely to change careers multiple times over their lifetime.” Her sentiments are shared by Pawel Adrjan, an economist and director of EMEA economic research at jobs website Indeed. “If the past few years have taught us anything, it’s to expect the unexpected,” he says. “So while some areas look set for increased demand over coming years, the best thing an early careerist can do is make sure they get a broad range of experience early on. A degree can be a jumping off point and does not necessarily dictate what you have to do for the rest of your life. “Take stock of your values, skills and aptitudes. Look at the key skills that your degree gives you, and then look at where they best transfer. That will help you map out avenues you might like to explore in your career. “It’s also important to identify what your priorities are when looking for a job. Is salary key or would you be willing to trade off for more flexibility? What learning opportunities would you like to access? Would you like to travel or work from a certain location? “These priorities are likely to change throughout your career so it’s good to check in with yourself regularly as your priorities shift.” Undergraduate course selection is the first chapter in your career story rather than a high-pressure lifelong decision— Brendan Lally, University of Limerick careers adviser University of Limerick (UL) careers adviser Brendan Lally also acknowledges the uncertainties with predicting the future jobs market, but says school leavers “should expect lifelong learning to include upskilling and re-skilling with multiple career changes as people work longer”. “What you’re good at now and what your parents and teachers have helped you identify as your strengths is just a starting point,” he says. “Undergraduate course selection is more a first chapter in your career story rather than a high-pressure lifelong decision. “There are current students at the University of Limerick and other campuses around the country studying for careers that may not exist yet or will be radically different in 10 years’ time. “Many of next year’s first years in higher education will study for careers that have yet to be defined. So, students preparing for third-level must be more conscious of the world they live in rather than just their world.” Lally points to Government reports of “future skills needs” that can provide useful information for those making choices and which give rise to in-demand courses. “They give good indications of what can be expected and point to growth in green technology, bio medical and bio pharma,” he says. “The upward trajectory of tech and, in particular, the challenges around privacy and cyber security point to other rapid growth areas. Demographics point to an ageing population, with challenges around care and health. “Engineering will continue to advance with automation, robotics and machine learning, and the impact of AI and big data to name but a few.” LinkedIn’s McCooey agrees that areas such as the green economy are likely to be bountiful hunting grounds for jobseekers down the tracks. “Obviously there are industries like technology and pharma that are in high demand, as well as more traditional industries that will always be hiring such as the legal and engineering sectors,” she says. “For example, one of the most popular roles advertised on LinkedIn last year was for software engineers. “Naturally sectors like the tech, healthcare and legal sectors will continue to need large pipelines of talent, but we will also see new areas emerge, particularly in the green economy. “Looking at the area of climate change, it’s obvious that many industries need to change and there will be opportunities across the board, whether it is a reimagining of traditional areas like the boom in retrofitting in the construction sector or a future demand for expertise about renewable energy sources like wind turbines. “In the past five years, the number of renewables and environment jobs in the US has increased by 237 per cent. We expect a similar boom in demand in Ireland.” McCooey says the five fastest growing green jobs between 2016 and 2021 were sustainability managers, wind turbine technicians, solar consultants, ecologists, and environmental health and safety specialists. Indeed’s Adrjan says demand for healthcare roles – which was boosted by the pandemic – will persevere in the years ahead. “Since the pandemic we have seen consistent high demand across essential services such as healthcare – at the moment therapy, pharmacy and home care are particularly in demand,” he says. “When trying to predict a prosperous career path, one thing to look at is currently pressing problems or developing areas – environmental issues, socio economic development, digital connectivity – these can be a good predictor of where demand will lie. “Trends indicate demand for remote work will continue in office-based roles, which means that graduates may need to prepare to enter a new hybrid workforce, and must be ready to adapt to that style of working from the outset.” If you take the same role from 2015 to 2022, roughly 25 per cent of the skills that are required for that role have changed— Sharon McCooey, head of LinkedIn Ireland Most of the experts agree that the best thing students can do as they begin life at third-level education is to build a bank of transferrable skills rather than worrying too much about the specifics of what they are doing. “If you have an obvious interest in an area like tech or law, obviously pursue your passion,” says McCooey. “If it’s a case, however, that you are simply choosing a course based on a greater chance of getting employed once you graduate, it is important to know that you can always study something that you enjoy and then add extra qualifications or learn additional skills required for a role. “Employers are rethinking hiring and increasingly placing greater emphasis on a candidate’s skills and overall potential to ensure great talent is not overlooked. This is actually a really important consideration for very specialised areas. “For example, AI is a sector that’s on the rise, but the pipeline of talent available is quite small, so most organisations have to rely on professionals transitioning into the space,” McCooey says. “Recent LinkedIn data shows us that if you take the same role from 2015 to 2022, roughly 25 per cent of the skills that are required for that role have changed. “For example, Jira, Kubernetes and Python were among the top 10 skills added by LinkedIn members in the IT sector during 2021 contrasting with more traditional skills like SQL, JavaScript and Software Development topping the list back in 2015. “Ultimately, a key takeaway for any student is that you do not stop your education journey when you graduate. “By the time this generation enters the workforce, hiring practices will be reimagined in that the focus will not simply be on your degree – recruiters will be looking at your core skills and how adaptable you are.” UL’s Lally pushes the importance that school leavers understand that deep learning, even in big demand disciplines, is not enough to ensure guaranteed future success. “In higher education what defines success can often be viewed as the grade you come out with at the end,” he says. “Graduate recruiters in organisations will define success more broadly. “In your final year, graduate employers will want you to show them evidence and examples of your ability and transferable skills. Skills required can include evidence of collaboration, resilience, learning agility, growth mind-set, critical analysis, initiative, drive and adaptability. “Much of this will be determined by what you do outside the classroom and lecture theatre. My tip for reaching your career goals is not only to study hard... Your future employment and life prospects will improve with experiences such as a work placement, a study abroad Erasmus experience with foreign language opportunity, part-time jobs, sports participation, campus societies and volunteering. “These will allow you to take ownership and demonstrate skills and ability. Balancing your time for all of this is difficult, but prospective employers recognise this and target those that do it well.” Lally advises students at this point in their journeys to devote one hour per week to their “own personal career education”. “Your college career service and website will have everything you need, to plan ahead,” he says. They can help you with self-awareness; job market analysis; how best to present yourself; and how to understand how employers will assess you.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Private sector delivering more than seven in 10 new social homes, department figures show',\n",
       "  'text': 'More than two-thirds of the social housing units delivered in the first nine months of last year were procured directly from private developers, underscoring the State’s reliance on the private sector to deliver housing. Figures obtained from the Department of Housing show that 2,706 new-build social homes were delivered up to the end of September last year. Of these, 1,946 units (72 per cent) were acquired by way of so-called turnkey purchases – where the local authority or approved housing body (AHB) enters into a forward-purchasing arrangement with a private developer – or through the Part V rule, which stipulates developers must set aside a certain portion of their developments for social housing. [ IDA officials anxious about impact of housing crisis on inward investment, emails show ] Turnkeys represented 54 per cent (1,452) of the total while Part Vs represented 18 per cent (294). Twenty-eight per cent (760 homes) were delivered directly by local authorities via the Social Housing Capital Investment Programme or by approved housing bodies through the Capital Advance Leasing Facility. The figures were provided by Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien in response to a parliamentary question from Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin. Mr Ó Broin said: “Turnkeys in and of themselves are not a problem but the heavy overreliance on private developers to deliver social housing is very risky.” The core problem was the level of red tape imposed on local authorities doing their own developments, he said. “Until the Government fixes that red tape, there will be a perverse incentive to continue overrelying on private developers,” Mr Ó Broin said. “And at a time when commencements are falling, that’s a high-risk strategy.” [ Relying on private sector to build houses a ‘vulnerability’, officials say ] Reliance on the private sector to deliver housing was highlighted as a “vulnerability” in a briefing document prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its new Minister, Paschal Donohoe, when he took up the role last month. The document highlighted structural issues such as planning and construction costs as a “challenge” to delivery of Government targets. It estimated that up to 6,500 social homes would be delivered in 2022 (the end-year figures have not been released yet), down from a target of 8,000. But even this figure may be at risk with just 2,706 delivered in the first nine months of 2022. With new housing commencements falling, department officials raised concern that housing targets would continue to come under pressure. There was a 14 per cent year-on-year decline in new housing units commenced in the third quarter of 2022, which industry officials and analysts linked to the rapid acceleration in build costs. In his response to Mr Ó Broin, Mr O’Brien said: “Housing for All is the Government’s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade. “This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes by 2030. Housing for All is supported by an investment package of over €4 billion per annum, through an overall combination of €12 billion in direct exchequer funding, €3.5 billion in funding through the Land Development Agency and €5 billion funding through the Housing Finance Agency,” he said.',\n",

       "  'text': 'People who know Michael Stone - or Mick, as he is known to those close to him - say he has sounded shell-shocked over Paschal Donohoe’s election posters controversy. For a very private individual who takes great pride in working hard, below the radar, being at the centre of a political and media storm is not somewhere where the 54-year-old Dubliner likes to be. This is behind his decision to stand down from two public roles, as chairman of the North East Inner City Programme Implementation Board and as a board member of the Land Development Agency, after admitting that he helped his friend, Paschal Donohoe, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, erected posters in a second general election, in 2020. Stone said in a statement on Tuesday morning that he did not want the controversy to be “a distraction” from the “very important” work of the two bodies. “I think he is feeling pretty sore. I think he just feels that no good deed goes unpunished,” said one person who knows him and has worked closely with him. “He just feels like people are talking about him and he likes to fly below the radar. I think he is finding it pretty difficult.” Donohoe admitted omitting a sum of €1,057 from his 2016 general election expenses covering the use of a van provided by a company run by Stone and the payment of six workers to erect election posters in the Fine Gael Minister’s Dublin Central constituency in the election. In Stone’s statement on Tuesday, he said he had mistakenly told Donohoe - in December and again last week- that he had not provided the politician with help on postering in the 2020 general election only to later discover that he had when he “re-checked” the matter. He apologised to Donohoe and confirmed that he, through a member of the Fine Gael team in Dublin Central, personally paid for six people to poster at a cost of €972 and for supplying some of the individuals with vans for the postering work at a commercial value of €434.20. “I deeply regret any embarrassment that I have caused Paschal for my mistaken recollection in relation to 2020 and for what I thought was modest help for hardworking honest politician,” said Stone. Pocket change The sums involved must seem like pocket change to the successful businessman. He owns The Design Group, a mechanical and electrical engineering business he founded in 1992. The “mech-and-elec” people are the ones who come in to fit out a property once built. The business recorded a turnover of €175 million and a profit of almost €18 million in the year to the end of March last, according to its latest accounts. It ended the year with cash of €36 million. The group pocketed a one-off gain of €15 million during the year, selling the remaining 50 per cent of its facilities management division to Sisk, a joint venture partner since 2019. The Design Group employs more than 700 people and works on projects in Ireland, the UK, Africa, Europe and North America. Among its projects are the refit of the Shelbourne Hotel, the Technology University Dublin campus at Grangegorman in Donohoe’s own constituency, work on Dublin Castle prior to Ireland’s EU presidency in 2013 and the Qantas lounge at Heathrow Airport in London. The company’s work on commercial properties, data centres and life sciences facilities and for bluechip clients ranging from Amazon to Microsoft to Hilton means that the Dublin 11-registered business has performed exceptionally well in recent years. The success of the group is a long way from Stone’s humble beginnings, growing up on Aughrim Street in Dublin. The proud inner-city Dubliner started working as an apprentice at the ESB while still a teenager. He was identified by the semi-state as a high-flier who was given the electrical training that has stood to him when it came time to setting up his own business. That decision came when he was 24. He has admitted that if had stayed another couple of years at the ESB, it would have become a job for life. Instead he wanted to break out on his own. “But the opportunity was there and I’m very ambitious. I love work. A semi-state body was probably a bit restrictive for me. I wanted that feeling of being my own boss. I had just got married and not long afterwards my first child was born. If I had left it until after that I would been too afraid,” he said. The Design Group’s expansion internationally before the 2008 property crash meant that it weathered the economic storm that took out many other companies in the construction sector. The reach of his company brought profile and standing for Stone in the industry. He served as president of the Electrical Contractors’ Association and of the Mechanical Engineering & Building Services Contractors Association before stepping up to become president of the powerful lobby group, the Construction Industry Federation, between 2014 and 2016. Dogged work ethic Commercial success has brought personal wealth. Last year, he paid €4.6 million for a house on Killiney Hill designed by Irish architect Jack O’Hare, an apprentice of the famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The home has panoramic views of Killiney Bay and is set on more than an acre of gardens amid some of the country’s most expensive postcodes. Outside of work, he is a lifelong GAA fan. Stone played senior inter-county hurling for Dublin and is a member of Eoghan Rua GAA club, now amalgamated with Oliver Plunketts. Friends talk about Stone’s impressive levels of energy and focus, and how has brought the dogged work ethic that made his business such a success into the two public roles. As chairman of the North East Inner City Programme Implementation Board, he oversaw the area’s social and economic regeneration, a project close to his heart given his roots in the area. “Mick Stone is a massive loss for Dublin’s north east inner city,” said Feargal O’Rourke, managing partner at PWC Ireland and a member of the board. “As a member, I have seen first hand his role on the Inner City group and he has done more in recent years for this area than anyone else in the country. He is very hands on and has put hundreds of hours in to improve the area and the lot of the people living there, without any personal agenda or compensation. He will simply be impossible to replace.” Stone joined the board of the State’s Land Development Authority in 2019 in an appointment made by the then minister for housing Eoghan Murphy. He received no fees for his role on the inner-city programme and has waived his yearly fee of €15,759 from the LDA. In a sign of Stone’s diligence, one colleague at the LDA remembers him video-calling into a meeting of the board while he was on a business trip to Mexico at about 4am local time. Above and beyond “He goes way above and beyond and in that sense he really does have the public service ethos and is very committed to both housing and inner-city development,” he said. Stone is said to have been particularly proud of the LDA’s first big housing development, a project of 600 social and affordable homes on State land at Shanganagh, south of Shankill, providing much needed homes for the south Dublin and north Wicklow area. One colleague, speaking before Stone’s resignation, expressed concern at his potential departure from the LDA and the loss of “a genuine expert who has a deep understanding of how projects all fit together.” “What I would be concerned about is that he would just disappear into the background,” said the source who puts his help in Donohoe election postering down to his willingness to help a friend and politician he respected. “I am sure it never cost him a thought, throwing up a few posters.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'Minister of State of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Pippa Hackett welcomed the significant progress highlighted in the Organic Strategy Forum report published today. The Report summarised the activities of the Forum in its first year of operation and was presented to the Minister by the Forum Chair, Mr. Padraig Brennan. The Forum was established by the Minister to bring together all relevant stakeholders in the Organic sector to drive forward the development of the sector and tackle barriers to its future growth. The Forum comprises representatives from relevant State Agencies, farm bodies, organic food processors and organic certification bodies. Minister Hackett stated “The Organic Strategy Forum has played a key role in identifying practical solutions to some of the barriers to the growth of the sector. I commend the work of the Chair, Padraig Brennan and the stakeholders for their work in identifying both issues and solutions to allow us to build on the experienced and dedicated cohort of organic farmers and processors we have here in Ireland. One of the priorities of the forum was to increase the critical mass of the organic sector and this was reflected in the record number of 2,100 new applications in Autumn 2022 to join the Organic Farming Scheme. We will drive on with this now and reopen the scheme again before the end of 2023”. “Development of new market opportunities for our increasing organic output is a clear priority for all of us this year. This will be a key focus of minein 2023, including leading a trade mission with Irish companies to the world’s largest organic trade fair, Biofach in Germany, next month”. The priorities for the Organic Strategy Forum in 2023 are highlighted in the progress report and reiterate the requirement to further increase participation in organic farming over the coming years to capitalise on the significant uptake recorded in 2022. Equally important priorities include: The co-ordination of organic supplies and reducing leakageDeveloping the market for Irish organic foodGreen procurementEducationInfrastructure and the capturing of accurate organic production data Chair of the Organic Strategy Forum, Padraig Brennan, concluded: “I would like to thank Minister Hackett for her strong support for the Organic Strategy Forum. The support and constructive engagement of the Forum members and their strong advocacy for organic farmers, producers and consumers ensures that we are well positioned to anticipate and proactively respond to the challenges and opportunities facing the organic food sector. Given the rapidly evolving marketplace and the ever-increasing focus on the environment, the expertise and experience of Forum members will be decisive in maintaining an upward growth in the value of the organic food sector. I look forward to working in partnership with the Department and the Forum members to ensure that the growth potential of this increasingly important sector is fully realised.” END Note for Editors: The Organic Strategy Forum progress report is available at the following link',\n",

       "  'text': \"However, everything we read and hear right now suggests that building can be a nightmare and that builders are unable to give accurate tenders given a whole load of factors from the war on Ukraine to other supply issues, price inflation, labour shortages and all that chaos. Is there any light at all at the end of the tunnel? And, at the risk of asking how long is a piece of string, what are broad costs per square metre for a one-off home on level site likely to be in a year or two’s time? It all makes getting married sound like a walk in the park! Thanks, Anne and Michael, Ballincollig. Hello Anne and Michael and thank you for your question. It seems like you are jumping from the frying pan into the fire! It is certainly a complex issue and I have yet to meet someone who has a definitive view on how this will all play out. To help answer your question, I feel we should look back a little at the source of these inflationary issues before we gaze into the crystal ball for the future. Before Covid (remember that?) we experienced a very long (almost zero) inflationary period when labour and material prices increased, but unless it was over a sustained period of time, it didn't have a huge impact on your project cost. In most cases, it would make little or no difference to the cost of your project throughout its duration. Then, in 2020, we had the first Covid lockdown (which lasted about six months) followed eventually by the reopening of the economy and construction sector. There was a sudden burst of energy where we began to build houses, commercial buildings, factories and infrastructure once again. There was not any significant inflation or lack of materials at the beginning of this reopening, but why was that? From what I have learned, if you remember way back then, we had been making provisions for the chaos Brexit might bring. As a result, we had significant stockpiles of most materials in place to smooth out the inevitable supply chain friction. In truth, Brexit was dwarfed by Covid, but these stockpiles facilitated a reasonably smooth exit from the first lockdown and let's face it, nobody really noticed or spoke of any difficulties. Fast forward to the following series of lockdowns and reopenings, we had no more stockpiles so when factories, transport and warehousing was mothballed, the real problems started. I remember getting a phone call from a manager of a building supplier who told me that there would be very significant delays and material price hikes ahead for even the most basic of building materials. We experienced this issue for some time but like most issues, the market reacts and gets to grips with the issue. Then, about this time last year, I spoke to the same building supplier manager, who told me that he expected things to start levelling and likely improve as 2022 wore on. Cue the beginning of the war in Ukraine a month later. Now, all bets are off. We have seamlessly transitioned from Brexit stockpiles to Covid related supply chain issues to an energy crisis with Russia controlling much of the world's gas, who knew? All of a sudden, while supply timelines were reasonable, prices soured again, particularly for materials whose productions are energy intensive. So, now it's that time of year again. I have been getting soundings from said building supplier company that they are cautiously optimistic. Some elements, for example, rough timber and steel (which were some of the first materials to rise) have in fact dropped a little, many elements are more or less level, and there are a few elements which are still rising, particularly plastering & quarried products (concrete blocks, aggregates, cement). So, has the market absorbed the full ramifications of the war in Ukraine? Maybe to date but who knows what way this war may twist and turn this year. We all hope it will come to an end soon but no one knows. Most builders are not taking inflation risk as they cannot measure it so the consumer (you) is having to carry it. Will prices come back down? My sense is that when there are significant reductions in input costs, these will be passed on as there will be pressure on the construction industry to do so given the fact that interest rates are rising at present. When and by how much will things improve, I don't know, but I am certainly looking ahead with cautious optimism this year, that is unless something new arrives on the horizon.

       "  'title': 'Irish investment consortium in €6.5m deal for landmark Donnybrook Mall',\n",
       "  'text': 'A consortium of private investors based in the west of Ireland has paid about €6.5 million for the landmark Donnybrook Mall in Dublin 4. Acquired by developer Sean Dunne for €17 million at the height of the last boom, the mall last changed hands in 2014, with its outgoing owner, an individual private Irish investor, paying €6.6 million to secure ownership of the 1,448sq m (15,590sq ft) property. On this occasion the scheme was offered to the market by agent Lisney last September at a guide price of €6.8 million. The buyers are believed to have secured the property in the face of competition from a number of parties. The mall’s new owners will have the benefit of immediate rental income of €450,343 annually from a strong tenant line-up which includes Tesco, Lloyds Pharmacy, the well-known dry cleaners Lyknu, Abrakebabra, and the long-established bridalwear boutique Marian Gale. The complex’s development potential is borne out by its positive planning history with one of Sean Dunne’s companies, Padholme, securing permission from Dublin City Council in 2008 for a three-storey over-basement mixed-use development of 3,455sq m (37,189sq ft) comprising six retail units, two office units, one restaurant/takeaway, one bank unit and four two-bedroom apartments as well as 15 car spaces. The permission was subsequently extended in 2014 to 2019. Donnybrook has seen significant residential development over recent years, with much of this aimed towards the upper end of Dublin’s private rented sector (PRS) market. Richmond Homes is currently at an advanced stage of building 139 apartments at Eglington Place on the corner of Eglington Road and Donnybrook Road, while Keith Craddock’s Red Rock Donnybrook Ltd obtained planning permission for a 10-storey 84-apartment build-to-rent scheme on the Circle K petrol station site opposite Bective Rangers’ rugby grounds. Developer Shane Whelan’s Westridge Real Estate, meanwhile, is developing a 91-unit co-living scheme across seven storeys on the site of the former Kiely’s public house. At Donnybrook Crescent construction is under way of Lovett House which is an eight-storey mixed-used development containing 49 build-to-rent apartments.',\n",

       "  'text': 'With demand falling, the amount of \"grey space,\" in Cork, defined as spare office accommodation that remains dormant despite being leased, is also likely to rise further in the new year, with many occupiers considering subletting surplus office space that they no longer need. The trend comes amid a surge in job cuts across Ireland\\'s tech sector, along with working from home and global uncertainty causing a major shift in post-pandemic work practices. Research published last year showed that 78% of employees wanted to stay working from home, and as energy prices continue to put a strain on office expenses, many companies have facilitated this by enabling more flexible working conditions. Despite already significant vacancy rates, estate agent, Lisney Sothebys has warned that Cork is 12 months behind Dublin, where grey space already accounts for a third of the capital\\'s commercial property. The agency has warned that commerical vacancy rates could increase even further in Cork, leading to a reduction in headline rents, with the report finding that even if they remain unchanged, landlords will need to offer greater incentive packages to influence demand. While the supply of commercial property remains bouyant, residential accommodation in Cork is still heavily undersupplied, with the agency saying that it remains so despite a 62% increase in 2022. Furthermore, the construction of new homes also started to fall back in the second half of last year following a surge in construction costs and funding needs, with Lisney Sotheby\\'s warning that this will continue to be an issue this year, further impacting supply which will be particularly difficult for first time buyers. While forecasts for the upper-end of the residential market remain strong, the agency has warned that the mid and entry level parts will continue to experience affordability issues to a greater extent as mortgage rates increase and disposable income levels fall.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Loan approvals at Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), the Government agency charged with funding the delivery of new homes, have increased by 49 per cent, new data has shown. The agency said total loan approvals at the end of 2022 amounted to just under €1.25 billion, up from a total of €835 million at the end of 2021. Almost three-quarters of that figure has already been drawn down, at €909 million for 60 developments, with 4,132 units under construction or completed. That means around €413 million was approved for new housing projects over the course of last year. But the figures also showed a slowdown in the rate of new approvals in the latter half of 2022. Between January and June, some €325 million in loan approvals were logged, with that figure dropping to €88 million in the second half of the year. “The first half of 2022 was our busiest ever six-month period in terms of loan approvals and, while we saw a lower level of applications and new approvals in the second half reflecting a slowdown in construction activity across the market, feedback from housebuilders indicates that demand for new funding is resilient despite the challenges of construction price inflation and higher interest rates,” said HBFI chief executive Dara Deering. HBFI has approved funding for more than 5,700 new homes in 99 developments, spread across 21 counties. Around a quarter of those home are social housing, with 50 per cent for owner occupiers, 20 per cent for renters and 5 per cent for Part V, which stipulates developers must set aside a portion of their developments for social housing. More than 1,200 HBFI-funded units have already been sold, and a further 1,800 were contracted for sale or sale agreed at the end of 2022. The majority of the homes – 70 per cent – funded by HBFI are two- or three-bed units aimed at the first-time buyer market. The average overall facility size has remained around €13 million, with individual loan facilities ranging from €1 million to €94 million. “Through its broad product range, and agile business model, HBFI plays a key role in the Government’s strategy to meet the targets set out under Housing for All. Today’s update highlights the strong performance by HBFI over the last six months,” said the Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath. “With viability remaining challenging for the construction sector, I welcome HBFI’s commitment to work with customers and stakeholders to support a continued increase in housing supply in the market. I am confident HBFI will continue to work to monitor the risks and opportunities for future funding.” HBFI was established by the Government in late 2018 to address a shortfall in finance available for the construction of residential housing by providing finance at market rates to commercially viable developments.',\n",

       "  'title': 'New rules on collective bargaining could transform union landscape, says Ictu general secretary Owen Reidy',\n",
       "  'text': 'Proposed changes to the rules of engagement between employers and trade unions could give more workers meaningful representation in their workplaces, Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) general secretary Owen Reidy says. Appointed late last year to succeed Patricia King as general secretary, 50-year-old Reidy from Donegal describes the Minimum Wage Directive and its promotion of the increased collective bargaining coverage clause as “probably the most progressive thing from a workers’ rights point of view that’s come out of the European Union in the last two decades”. In addition, the anticipated implementation of the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF) High-Level Working Group on Collective Bargaining is set to require companies to engage with unions in “good faith”. Combined, the two measures could mark a major turning point for unions that have been battling hard for quite some time to maintain membership numbers even as the nation’s workforce expanded dramatically. [ Why has Isme been left out of collective bargaining forum? ] “There’s a lot in the directive,” Reidy says. “In a nutshell, it will oblige the government to seek to promote collective bargaining between unions and employers, negotiating on pay both locally and at sectoral level. Collective bargaining coverage in Ireland is about 34 per cent, that’s including public service. Union density (membership levels) among all workers is about 27 or 28 per cent. “So there are some people who aren’t in unions but get the benefit of an agreement. But the commission is basically saying we need to see collective bargaining coverage around 80 per cent which would be doubling it in Ireland.” This, he suggests, is partly down to European leaders reacting to the rise of the sort of populism that yielded Brexit and far-right election successes in a number of countries. “The current commission is led by Ursula von der Leyen who is from the centre right but it has made it clear that work must pay because they want the centre to hold. We, as part of the European Trade Union movement, said ‘well, the best way for work to pay is through collective bargaining, not necessarily through minimum wages; it’s through facilitating unions and employers to negotiate’.” The LEEF High Level Group, which included union leaders, academics, senior figures from the Irish Business and Employers’ Confederation (Ibec) and the construction industry and Government officials, delivered a report in October that sets out the grounds on which collective bargaining can be reformed in Ireland. Included in the report was a provision that firms be obliged to engage in “good faith” with unions. If the employers fail to do so, even where unions are representing relatively small numbers of their workers, they can ultimately end up before the courts. One senior Siptu official says that would “save the union movement” as many private sector employers who currently decline to engage could be obliged to. That would potentially make union membership far more appealing in sectors like the traditional powerhouse of manufacturing where it is now running at 13 per cent according to a report by the Geary Institute at UCD. In hospitality, with its many low-paid jobs, it was found to be close to half that. In his previous role as minister for enterprise, Leo Varadkar suggested the provisions could become law this year, although the department’s briefing document for his successor, Simon Coveney, suggests 2024 may be more likely. Reidy credits the now Taoiseach with some progressive legislation while at the department but says there may be “forces” there who are less than enthusiastic about any substantial changes to the labour relations landscape. Given the stakes, he suggests, the unions may have to fight their corner although he believes there is an understanding on the employers’ side that many of the proposed changes can help to provide long-term stability. “I do think, you know, in the 21st century, it makes sense to kind of share power, it makes sense to operate collectively across Europe in a multilateral world, and it makes sense to try and improve workers voice in the labour market,” he says before suggesting Ibec’s Danny McCoy may largely agree. While LEEF’s work to date has been important, he says, “we would like, like Ibec, a much more deeper, more meaningful involvement”. [ Fintan O’Toole: Want to change the world? Join a union ] Reidy understands, he says, the lingering discomfort in some quarters with aspects of partnership but argues that Government, by improving things like public transport, delivering better healthcare and providing increased support in areas like childcare, can help maintain or improve living standards without workers having to rely entirely on wage increases. This, he believes, is a large part of the pay off for companies who, he contends, must pay for the bulk of the additional public expenditure envisaged through increased taxes. Beyond that he insists the Ictu and its affiliates are in a decent position to build off the back of the changes with issues like pay and remote working providing a strong basis for connecting with members new and old. [ New Ictu general secretary Owen Reidy targets recruitment of young members as priority ] “The legislation isn’t going to organise any workers,” he says, “but I do think with a fair wind it’ll facilitate and create the capacity for unions to up their game when it comes to organising more workers.” Not everything in that UCD report, Union Voice in Ireland, would provide encouragement but Reidy refers more than once to a finding that 66 per cent of young workers in non-union environments say they would like to join a union. “It’s exciting,” he says, at the prospect of all that young union blood. It must be. It will certainly have been a while coming.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Over 28,700 units of large developments are awaiting An Bord Pleanála permission',\n",
       "  'text': 'A TOTAL of 28,786 units in housing and apartment developments are awaiting a planning permission decision from An Bord Pleanála, new analysis has found. The annual constructor sector report from consultants Mitchell McDermott found that 59% of Strategic Housing Developments (SHDs) applications before An Bord Plenála last year did not receive a decision. The SHD system was designed as a fast-track planning process for schemes of 100 apartments or houses. The analysis found that the Bord granted permission for just 26% of applications, or almost 13,000 units. “Everyone knows the Bord has had its issues this year but to have so many units deplayed amid a housing crisis is unacceptable,” Paul Mitchell, one of the authors of the report, said. “You would imagine this backlog could easily be addressed by drafting in additional resources from private practice here or from the UK and we believe this should be done straight away,” he said. There was a 79% drop in the number of judicial reviews taken against SHDs last year. Mitchell said the firm found the reduction was due in large measure to the large drop in the number of decisions being made by An Board Pleanála on SHDs. The report found that a total of 31,125 units in SHDs which received planning permission have been subjected to judicial reviews over the past five years. “Just 10% or so have gone ahead, 10,727 units were quashed, while 17,805 are still awaiting a decision from the courts – a total of 28,532,” Mitchell said. A second of the report focused on tracking the number of SHDs which received planning permission between 2018 and 2022 but have not yet commenced. It found that of the 103,057 SHD units which received planning permission during this period, 28,755 (28%) have not yet commenced. Construction costs The report also found that the construction costs of a two-bed mid-range apartment increased by 9.6% or between €21,000 to €25,000 last year. The hard costs of building a two-bed, medium rise suburban apartment is now over €240,000, it found. The main contributors to the increase are mechanical and electrical services, up 18%, concrete, up 27%, brickwork, up 39%, and reinforcement steel, up 17%. The €240,000 figure excludes indirect costs, parking, siteworks, margin and VAT. If those are included the total cost of delivering the apartment is in the region of €460,000; the sales price would have to equal or exceed this.',\n",

       "  'title': \"The political Unionist cake is not growing. Only who wins the bigger slice alters. – Slugger O'Toole\",\n",
       "  'text': 'A publication for Church leaders recently headlined ‘the rise of the ‘dones’; a growing number of people who are ‘done with the Church.’ They have not abandoned their faith but have ‘de-churched.’ Attendance figures bear this out. One interviewee commented: ’they have heard it all and are tired of the same routine; being lectured to without any meaningful engagement or participation.’ Church scandals have played their part. The situation resonates with Northern Ireland as political parties exhibit a ‘this is the way mentality’; that without tight control and direction, everything will fall apart and decision-making will lose focus; But this sort of detached leadership is becoming less attractive. Bored with politics and politicians that convert every issue and political discourse into an arena for conflict and narrow political allegiances, a growing proportion of the population is not merely rejecting historical religious labelling and identities but their closely associated political affiliations. Polling and university research on prevailing demographics show consistent growth in the middle ground with the mainline parties, nationalist-republican and unionist, left to engage in internecine electoral battles to win the biggest share of their chosen but steadily reducing constituencies. The political Unionist cake is not growing. Only who wins the greater slice alters. Within unionism, many continue to support the maintenance of the Union however it is not just millennials and those who voted to remain in the EU who comprise a sizeable proportion, increasingly de-motivated and feeling unrepresented; disenfranchised by the limited ambition and accountability of political Unionism. An expedient unanimity of shared but tenuous, – if recent UUP spokespersons are to be believed – and divergent unease with and antipathy, across broad unionism, towards the Ireland/Northern Ireland protocol, cannot mask what is hidden in plain sight. Unease with the protocol, genuine as it may be, does not equate to support or approval for past and present decision-making by political unionism. With its traits of being intolerant, legalistic and irrelevant to the lived experiences of many, a growing constituency of individuals are ‘done’ with it and want a shift of focus. Where creative thinking is an imperative, unionists are offered robotic compliance by representatives entrenched in a culture of small mindedness; only comfortable in a culture bunker. This getting the meaning of the Union muddled with abstractions. There is much evidence. For the many who are placed on long waiting lists for healthcare if they are lucky, it is small comfort that as they suffer pain and maybe die, they do so under the Union flag. If is this what the Union means, the many tattered flags which adorn lamp-posts offer a stark symbolism. Too often unionist politics, pre-and post the Good Friday Agreement, are characterised by a failure to move beyond damage limitation and a lingering sense of ‘what has been given up’ crisis management. When immediate pressure is relieved, a sense of false certainty results and unionism reverts back to old behaviour; lack of transparency, failed leadership models, limited sense of mission and exclusivity. Capacity is not built to shape a long-term commitment to re-culturing and renewal; to build on growing success in key areas of the economy, education and culture to make Northern Ireland work for all; not seek to revert to ‘ ruling the roost.’ Rigidity in ideology and delusional claims to building reconciliation serve only to emphasise how unionism has facilitated the ugly scaffolding of the Good Friday Agreement to produce the ugly politics which have stalled or diverted the process inherent within the 1998 Agreement. This runs counter to the rationale for the scaffolding and is out of kilter with many pro-Union individuals and groups who do not work this way in their lives or communal and societal settings. Different civic organisations are gaining attention in numerous disciplines and sectors as vehicles for community building, promoting wellbeing and social change. Participatory actions and discourse challenge marginalisation and socio-political exclusion. This is the opposite of regulated political unionism which, frozen in an orthodoxy dating from the establishment of Northern Ireland, remains uncomfortable with disruption and challenge, internal and external. Such is also evident, not least in unionism’s willingness to operate and tinker at the edge of the Good Friday Agreement with little involvement or interest in North-South Bodies. It may yet fall off the edge. In 1998, Unionist and Nationalist-Republican parties, with others, were given the opportunity to emerge from prolonged conflict; to govern within a devolved continuum which did not shut out or call for the abandonment of long held constitutional preferences. The challenge to each of the designated MLAs, not least within the largest parties, was to persuade a majority of the community to endorse their platform for change, or not; whilst adhering to a popular mandate to implement the three strands of the Good Friday Agreement to the benefit of all. What has resulted is a fixed pattern of attrition, antagonistic populism and financial impropriety. This is a choice of the parties who populate the structures. The co-guarantors in London and Dublin are not without responsibility in indulging the political eco-system that pertains. Cobbled together lifeboat measures like A Fresh Start and New Decade, New Approach have not delivered promised outcomes or clear direction. Many pro-union voters have arrived at a point where they will no longer condone the complicity of political unionism in this power dynamic that staggers between ineffectiveness and posturing; crisis and erratic duration. Results do not equate to the resources made available whilst the main parties remain wedded to traditional platforms as a camouflage for self-interest, tribal power and privilege. Sometimes also to the benefit of relatives and family members who find employment funded by generous expenses. For anyone wishing to promote the Union, this is a deficit strategy destined to deliver long-term failure; a structural and electoral blind spot, preferring safeguards to growth. Unionism, like many groups and individuals, needs to move beyond its traditional binary interpretation and promotion of the Union by abandoning its PUL branding and creaking back of a lorry rhetoric. It needs to expand its scope and incorporate inclusivity into its analyses and networks; become more aspirational for the whole community. Build consensus by reducing space between people and move finally from tactics based on demographic dominance. As the Union is de-constructed and re-imagined at Westminster an alternative form of politically inclusive and consensual unionism is an imperative. It needs to draw on and make itself relevant to the lives of diverse sectors and groups which define the community. On recent performance, it is a big ask for Unionist political representatives in parties which seem to value the past more than a better future. Led by leaders and favoured cadres who promote blind loyalty, with silence used to monopolise power, there is limited evidence of any creative critique or strategic discourse. Yet, the time is opportune to embrace and coalesce around peace, justice, equality, inclusion, humanity and well-being. However, discouraged from thinking for themselves, representatives lend their minds to the leadership. This surely must produce a system of under-used assets and ignorance which filters into policies and practice; some views paramount whilst others are summarily dismissed. Resulting distortion by a dominant and rigid ideology underpinned by normative values is a long-standing trait of political unionism ensues. It is being eroded. Women, LBGTQ, diverse ethnic communities, younger people, socially liberal and marginalised people who reflect the historic hidden experience of unionism now conclude and demonstrate that a top-down framework is not conducive to building vital consensus around social, economic, health, housing, cultural and education issues; addressing wasteful segregation and lasting reconciliation to make Northern Ireland for all. Political Unionism needs to move beyond honeyed and condescending rhetoric when addressing non-aligned unionism and the community; grasp the possibilities; recognise and embrace the dynamic desire for a more pluralist and inclusive place, beyond narrow designations and identities. The longer this takes, the greater will be the growth in those muted conversations which are taking place as to how Northern Ireland needs to work better for all. There will be a cruel irony if the Union, currently on offer from those who value it most whilst going out of their way to distort its core purposes, acts as the author of its own demise. Will those who are ‘ done’ with political Unionism come to a point were they are done with this Union? It is not inconceivable that out of the continuing division and rigidity, a new mutuality will grow.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Home sales volumes down as prices jump 9.7%',\n",
       "  'text': 'The number of homes sold in the final three months of 2022 was more than 7 per cent lower than in the same period of 2021, with an almost 10 per cent jump in sales prices in the year, analysis of the Property Price Register (PPR) has indicated. Some 16,881 residential units, both new and existing, were sold in the fourth quarter of last year, 3,332 of which were new homes, according to a report from property tech start-up Geowox. This represents a 7.4 per cent decline in overall sales from the fourth quarter of 2021, when some 18,225 units changed hands. The figures are based on sales data rather than asking prices, with the reporting of a sale to the PPR often lagging behind the transaction itself. But despite the apparent drop in volumes, house prices climbed 9.7 per cent across the State between October and the end of December last year, with the median price of a home increasing by €27,000 over the 12-month period to €304,000, according to the data. On a county-by-county basis, Dublin had the highest volume of sales in the last quarter at 4,763, representing 28.2 per cent of the total, Geowox’s analysis showed. Dublin, where the median price of a property sold in the final three months of 2022 was €420,000, also remained the most expensive county in Ireland. Dublin and its commuter counties Meath, Kildare and Wicklow were the only counties where prices were above the Statewide median. The data for the Republic as a whole indicates that property price inflation, which cooled throughout the year amid rising borrowing costs and cost-of-living pressures, remained relatively stable in the second half of 2022. The annual rate of increase was 9.5 per cent in the year to the end of September 2022, according to Geowox’s last report, compared with a 14 per cent increase in the 12 months to the end of June. The figures broadly tally with Central Statistics Office data, published last week, which indicated that the cost of a home rose 8.6 per cent in the 12 months to the end of November, down from a 9.7 per cent increase in the year to October. The property industry here is still predicting positive growth in prices in 2023. Gareth McKeown, head of valuations at Geowox, said the resilience of the Irish housing market was “set to be tested” further this year. “Price growth may well be exacerbated by the Central Bank’s decision to ease mortgage lending rules to four times’ income,” he said. “Worrying trends” had also been observed in the construction sector, Mr McKeown said, with recent data indicating a slowdown in the rate of output. While it is clear that house price growth continued to cool in the fourth quarter, he said: “It remains to be seen how much of this is seasonal, and how much is fundamental. This will become clearer in the busy spring selling season.”',\n",

       "  'title': '‘All he did was put up those bleeding posters’ - Dublin inner city laments departure of Michael Stone',\n",
       "  'text': 'Paddy Murdiff, a long-time community activist in Dublin’s north inner city, lists off the projects that businessman Michael Stone oversaw during his five years chairing a State-backed board. “Mick Stone is probably the best person to happen to this community. He was very effective. It is a big loss for us,” said Murdiff of the businessman’s work in the inner city. Others connected with Dublin North East Inner City (NEIC) programme and have knowledge of Stone’s chairmanship of the implementation board agree, even after his resignation this week. The founder of multinational engineering business, The Designer Group, resigned from the NEIC implementation board and the board of the Land Development Agency (LDA). He did so after admitting to inadvertently misleading Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe over undisclosed help he gave putting up election posters for the 2020 general election. “Mick didn’t waste time. He was there to get a job done and everything he did was for the interest of the area,” said another local activist. “I deal with people all the time who talk about philanthropy. He put his time where his mouth was.” [ Profile: Michael Stone, the private man behind the public headlines ] For Murdiff, the one that stands out was the renovation of Lourdes Day Care Centre on Sean McDermott Street which provides a place for older people to meet and enjoy a hot meal. It was one of the first places that Stone visited after he became chairman of the implementation board set up in 2016 at the initiative of the then taoiseach Enda Kenny. The then Fine Gael leader had attended the funeral of a local man mistakenly murdered during a gangland feud and was profoundly affected by the tragic scenes he witnessed after the killing. The inner city regeneration effort worked over recent years because of Stone’s drive, the backing of Donohoe, a TD for the area and a Government Minister, and Martin Fraser, who was, until last year, the State’s top civil servant. Since 2016, the Government has invested more than €38 million through the NEIC to improve the lives of people living and working in the district. In Government circles, Stone is remembered for breaking down barriers to get things done. “Most of the things that you will see in the NEIC annual reports are down to Mick. He was the main fellah driving this. It wouldn’t have happened without him,” said one source. In the controversy over Donohoe’s election posters, Stone is said to be “bewildered” with all the media attention. He has been the biggest casualty of the affair, one lamented by those who worked closely with him. As they view it, he was a successful experienced businessman giving time freely and free of charge to two important State agencies tackling two huge problems in Irish society: poverty and housing. His resignation from the boards have left some concerned at the “chill effect” this might have on others, discouraging successful, private individuals from volunteering in public service. “If we had a few more Michael Stones who came out and gave back to their areas, I would be delighted,” said Fine Gael TD Michael Ring, a former minister for community development. “We need business people getting involved in politics, in social life, in disadvantaged areas. We need their advice and their expertise, and you need a different voice than civil servants. We need business people in this country to create jobs. Business is not a bad word,” he said. At the LDA, people valued Stone’s considerable experience in the area of engineering and construction when it came to the agency’s big housing projects. “He was providing an insight into the construction industry that very few people who serve on boards are willing or able to do,” said one source. The source said that on occasions when the LDA was engaging construction companies, Stone absented his company from the procurement process to avoid any appearance of impropriety. “He is very scrupulous about avoiding any conflict of interest,” said the source. I think he [Michael Stone] was one in a million. He did what he had to do and he was genuinely for the area, and that was the big part of it— Paddy Murdiff, community activist A senior Government official expressed concern that prominent people in the private sector “would run a mile” from high-profile public service roles in light of what has happened to Stone. “This is yet another example of a big witch-hunt around something about nothing,” he said. “It is becoming very dangerous to provide a public service to the best of your ability, even for free. It is a profound public policy problem. There seems to be nothing between zero and public crucifixion,” said the source. [ What does Michael Stone’s apology mean for Paschal Donohoe? ] The NEIC initiative was considered a successful template with talk of it being applied in other deprived parts of Dublin city. The resignation of Stone and the departure of Fraser to the Irish Ambassador’s job in London is viewed as an impediment to the future of the project. “It is very sad and kind of tragic for that area. It is going to be hard to replicate that,” said one former Government official who had first-hand knowledge of how the NEIC worked. Local community activist Murdiff is unsure of who they might find to replace Stone. “It will be detrimental to the area unless they get somebody like him. I think he was one in a million. He did what he had to do and he was genuinely for the area, and that was the big part of it,” he said. To those in working in the inner city, the cost of Stone’s departure to the initiative he chaired far outweighs the mistakes that led to his resignation this week. “All he did was put up those bleeding posters,” said Murdiff.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Many teachers like this one, a male primary teacher working in Limerick, don’t want to go on the record about their own students but many, even at primary level, report hearing about Tate from their students. “I mostly hear students mocking him,” says another teacher in an all-boys secondary, “but I’ve come across the odd boy, often a quiet student, who has been influenced.” Another teacher in a rural mixed school says: “I’ve never heard anything about him directly, but I got a response to a question about a novel that made me suspect that a student had been watching his videos.” Tate’s arrest on charges of rape and human trafficking in Romania was the first time many Irish adults had heard of him, but younger people here are reportedly well-acquainted with the champion kickboxer, entrepreneur, and anti-‘woke’ influencer. In July 2022, he was the most Googled name on the planet and in the virtual world of Tiktok, he is a well-established celebrity, where videos of him have been watched 11.6bn times. Tate describes hitting and choking women online, referring to them as “chicks”, “bitches”, and “hoes”. He has argued that rape victims must “bear responsibility” for their attacks in a clip watched over 2.5m times. The American-born, British citizen fled England in 2017 in the wake of numerous accusations of sexual assault by women there. His move to Romania was a calculated one. “I’m not a rapist… I like the idea of a man being free. In the West any woman can destroy a man for life… In Eastern Europe none of this stuff flies.” He is currently in detention in Romania, suspected of having recruited victims for a criminal online porn scam. Female teachers say some male students use Andrew Tate to intimidate them in the classroom. Students allegedly add the tag “make me a sandwich” to the end of their work, thereby announcing themselves as followers of the influencer. One young female teacher working in Dublin says: “I have one student in particular who idolises Tate. He brings him up all the time in class, to get a rise out of me, and it’s intimidating in an all-boys school. “I spoke to my boyfriend’s younger brother, who I can chat to on a different level, and he said that Tate is a genius because he says what everyone is afraid to say. “It’s terrifying that Andrew Tate is having this effect on the next generation. It’s happening and it’s not being stopped. “There are newspaper articles, but they’re not being discussed. Any 13-year-old boy in Ireland knows Andrew Tate. That’s a real problem.” Dismissing education Tate does his best to appear legitimate online. His “university”, in its third iteration, now called “Hustler University 3.0” announces itself as “a worldwide community of over 160,000+ active members learning from a select network of experts in freelancing, crypto, investing, and business”. For a $50 monthly membership fee people are offered an opportunity to match the extreme wealth and success of Tate, who claims to be “the smartest person on the fucking planet”. The Guardian reports that members, some as young as 13, are promised £10,000 a month by learning about crypto investing, drop shipping, and persuading other people to join. Tate’s approach is thoroughly and proudly anti-establishment and throughout his online narrative he actively dismisses mainstream education, which, he says, is left-leaning and “woke”. “We grow stronger every day,” he says of his online university, “while traditional education becomes less and less relevant.” Tate argues that men or boys should take control of women and become rich and successful. He presents the West as an emasculating culture in decline. He is clear and specific in his world view explaining to his millions of followers: “Women should clean up. Not only should women clean up, women should clean up unprompted… I pay for things unprompted… my card always works.” Feeding on boys' fears “Ask any class if they have heard of Tate and the majority will have done so,” says civics teacher Edwin Magnier, who works in a mixed Cork secondary school. He is is happy to go on the record to stem Tate’s influence over other young people in Ireland. “My awareness of this kind of threat began with the emergence of the alt-right movement. Boys are often targeted and radicalised online. “I’ve been concerned about it for the last five years and have been actively designing lessons to counteract the world view being taught to our young men.” As Magnier explains, people like Tate attack young minds before they are educated, and often bad-mouthing mainstream educators is part of their ploy. “Anyone with an education will see through it; we need to be very aware of it in the last few years of primary, whenever a child is given access to the internet. “By secondary [level], in my experience, most students laugh at him. He’s a person to ridicule, often used as a meme. It’s the younger or more vulnerable students we need to protect.” Tate often includes sound advice in the midst of his hateful rhetoric, explains Magnier, reminding young people to work hard for success for instance. He presents himself as a mentor and if a child lacks an actual mentor in their life, it can be both powerful and persuasive. “He delegitimises any other adults who might influence their minds in a positive way, like teachers. “This is a man with 17 expensive cars; he is uber rich and so young people see him as successful. His message to them is that you can be successful too if you overcome your ‘wokeness’. He argues that women are suffering in our culture too because they want to be dominated.” A 14-year-old girl brought Tate to Magnier’s attention after boys started to repeat his ideas in school. “His message to young men is that women are property,” says Magnier. “He tells boys and men to convince girls and women in their lives of that too — in order to manipulate them. He feeds on boys’ fears around masculinity and changing gender roles and links it back to his own wealth. “He describes himself as a powerful alpha male who dominates women. He warns his followers against being weak beta males who tend to be unsuccessful. “He tells them their meekness and inability to stand up to women will mean that women will dominate and destroy them. “The man is being accused of rape and human trafficking. He manipulates women to make money and is open about that. He is not a role model.” Ireland’s shortcomings when it comes to sex education are well documented. Spunout, Ireland’s youth information website created by young people, for young people, is concerned about the paucity of relationship education in schools. “The main source of our sex ed comes from social, personal and health education (SPHE). The current system donates just one hour per week to this subject. This is simply too little. “Sex ed is something that is very important for children, particularly in the junior cycle. “They are at an age when they are entering early puberty and without proper education on the subject of sex it can be a confusing time.” Psychotherapist and author Richard Hogan believes education on Tate needs to start at home. “We must talk to our children about his views; we must help children to think their way through his destructive and negative ideas about women and men’s role in society. Parents must help dismantle these views.” Students reportedly tell their teachers that they are fearful of sharing their online experiences with parents. They worry that their parents might curtail their usage in future. “No way would I show my mum what’s coming up on my screen,” one teacher reports hearing from a 12-year-old boy. “She’d take it off me!” In the UK, where Tate is perhaps best known, the education sector is proactive in its approach. Teachers report the serious “hold” he has on students, as is beginning to happen here. Some schools are running whole-school assemblies entirely devoted to Tate and his ideology. Men At Work CIC trains professionals who work with boys and young men to facilitate constructive dialogues with them about being safe. They have visited dozens of schools to date. They specifically address the reality of young boys being groomed and radicalised by people like Tate. Here, Justice Minister Simon Harris had admitted feeling worried about the influence of Tate on boys. “I think it shows what happens when the State doesn’t step up to its responsibilities. I don’t just mean this State, I mean in general… We need to be much better at providing age-appropriate information around sex education, around gender equality, and through the school curriculum.” Harris goes on to mention a “zero-tolerance strategy” in the pipeline for Irish schools. Other commentators argue that Tiktok needs to do far more to protect young users by ensuring all content on the platform is devoid of hateful, harmful messaging.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Ireland’s housing crisis: why doesn’t the State step in and build?',\n",
       "  'text': 'It’s perhaps the most frequently asked question of Ireland’s housing crisis. Why doesn’t the State step in and build? Whether the chronic undersupply or the lack of affordability meet the definition of market failure is immaterial, housing is now a block on the State’s future development. Perhaps the most galling aspect is that we don’t lack the means to address it. The exchequer is awash with tax receipts and there is an abundance of State land, either idle or underused, to be built on. In such circumstances, the Government’s overwhelming reliance on the private sector to deliver housing is difficult to weigh up particularly when the political fallout has been so severe. Some argue that the Government is ideologically wedded to the idea that the market is the most efficient model for dealing with the State’s housing needs and by extension opposed to the type of large-scale social housing projects we’ve had in the past. This neoliberal tendency can be seen in the shift away from building social homes directly in favour of providing rent supports – the so-called shift from bricks to benefits. And by the fact that the social housing which is provided comes – almost entirely – from the private sector. Of the 2,706 new-build social homes delivered up to the end of September last year, 72 per cent were acquired by way of so-called turnkey purchases – where the local authority or approved housing body (AHB) enters into a forward-purchasing arrangement with a private developer – or through the Part V rule, which stipulates developers must set aside a certain portion of their developments for social housing. [ The Irish Times view on the housing crisis ] Others argue that because the majority of voters here are homeowners who benefit from rising house prices, the Government is averse to a major intervention, which might depress prices and displace a significant chunk of private-sector activity. That seems unlikely, however, given the political heat the crisis is generating, And the days of governments benefiting from rising house prices are well gone. Policymakers may get it wrong but to suggest they’re harbouring hidden motives on housing seems overly conspiratorial. There is a simpler explanation, and one that seems to grow like a weed in Irish society: bureaucracy. For all the criticism laid at their door, local authorities here are so tied up in red tape and process when it comes to the provision of housing that purchasing units directly from the private sector has become a more efficient use of resources and time. More than Covid, more than higher construction costs, local councils link the undersupply of social housing to what’s known as the “four-stage process” – the heavily bureaucratic and massively time-consuming process that the Department of Housing and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform makes them go through when they want to build directly. To secure capital funding to build under the Department of Housing’s Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP), councils must first make the business case for the project before securing pre-planning approval. The first two phases are said to be relatively straightforward. However, it’s the next two stages where the problems start. Under the pre-tender design stage – stage three of the process – the local authority’s architects must engage with the Department of Housing’s architects to agree the final design, a back and forward process that can take months. [ More than 45,000 homes stuck in planning system despite housing crisis, consultants say ] When the final design is agreed, the councils, under the final cost-appraisal and procurement stage, must haggle with the department on what they think the tender price should be, mindful of various price caps set by the department, and rather weirdly before actually going out and procuring a builder to do the work. The price they agree with the department may not be the price they can secure in the marketplace. In a period of rapid cost price inflation, this process has become extremely difficult. The department also forces councils to adopt a new procurement process for each project rather than allowing keep a panel of prospective builders on tap through a framework agreement like in other sectors. If the proposed project is a mixed tenure development with affordable and disability-adapted units alongside standard social housing units, there are also different funding streams, each requiring their own four-stage process that must be navigated in parallel. All in, the pre-construction process is meant to take 52 weeks (with an additional one to two years for construction). In reality, it takes two or three years before a brick is even laid on the ground. Central government imposes these cost-control strictures. [ Government beats housing target but what difference does it make? ] But they are so rigorous that councils say they are effectively disincentivised to build, an irony given the lack of cost control we’ve seen with some of the bigger capital projects like the children’s hospital. Either way, a great public-sector housing build, something that is badly needed and something that could ease pressure right through the system, evades us. Last year’s social housing delivery target was meant to 9,000 units, it’s likely to be 6,500-7,500. In 1975, the then government, with a fraction of the financial resources of the current one, built 8,800 social homes, a record that is still to be eclipsed despite the severity of the current housing crisis.',\n",

       "  'title': \"Business group Ibec warns housing crisis is 'critical barrier to growth and business investment'\",\n",
       "  'text': 'BUSINESS GROUP IBEC has warned that the housing crisis is a critical barrier to continued growth and business investment. Ibec, a group that represents Irish businesses, has today launched a new housing report as part of its “Better Lives, Better Business” campaign. The group has called on the government to urgently deliver “a suite of ambitious policies to speed up the delivery of much-needed housing, and improve viability and affordability”. It has also issued some “key recommendations” which the group claims would “cut the cost of new home by €30,000”. ‘Challenge to business operations’ In a recent Ibec CEO survey, over 70% of companies identified housing availability for staff as a challenge to their business operations in the year ahead. However, 30% deemed this to be a “major challenge” while more than a quarter of businesses said the impact of housing availability on employees was one of the top three external priorities for their business. Ibec’s director of lobbying and influence Fergal O’Brien said: “An inadequate supply of affordable housing is the single largest impediment to attracting and retaining talented workers, without whom business investment and expansions are not possible.” He added: “The housing crisis has increasingly become a concern in relation to cohesion in the workplace and society more broadly. Younger workers, in particular, are financially pressed by ever-higher rents and the receding prospect of homeownership. “This ultimately spills over into issues around well-being and productivity in the workplace, while in the longer-term, if left unchecked, will also create emerging challenges in terms of pension adequacy and people’s broader stake in society over the coming decades.” O’Brien said that from “an employer perspective” there is a need to “reinvigorate the policy drive around the availability and affordability of housing”. He said this will include “reform of the planning and procurement system to speed delivery, a ramping up of ambition in affordable and cost-rental housing, and significant investment in skills and modern methods of construction”. O’Brien claimed that Ibec’s proposed fiscal measures would “reduce the cost of a typical €400,000 new home by €30,000 and this could be achieved with immediate effect”. ‘Key recommendations’ Some of Ibec’s key recommendations to address the housing crisis includes investment in Further Education to address skills shortages and “improved tax treatment of landlords’ expenses”. Ibec said “improved tax treatment of landlords’ expenses” could be achieved “while also ensuring greater security for tenants”. This would be done through “greater resourcing for local authorities and the Residential Tenancies Board to meet a 25% annual rental inspection target, a deposit protection scheme, and a national car testing equivalent scheme for the accommodation rental sector”. Ibec’s report also calls for local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to aim for the delivery of 20,000 social, cost-rental and affordable units annually by the end of the decade. The business group also included as a key recommendation the temporary introduction of a VAT refund order worth 5% of a new home for buyers of new build homes to offset rising costs of construction, as well as greater collaboration with manufacturers and the construction sector. Ibec is also seeking resources to recruit and retain staff to reduce planning backlogs and improve timeliness and to “significantly increase funding through the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) to ensure adequate development finance in the market”.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Credit Demand Survey April 2022 – September 2022  - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'The Department of Finance has today published the latest in its series on SME Credit Demand Surveys which covers the period April 2022– September 2022. This survey series is currently being conducted by Behaviour and Attitudes, on behalf of the Department of Finance. It is the most comprehensive survey of SME Credit Demand in Ireland, covering over 1,500 respondents through in-depth discussions. The survey captures a full picture of the SME landscape in Ireland, with micro-enterprises, small-sized enterprises and medium-sized enterprises accurately represented as per the percentage make-up of SMEs in Ireland. The survey is conducted biannually. Throughout the report, the most recent wave of findings (referred to as September 2022) is compared with corresponding waves. This ensures that historical comparisons are being made on a like-for-like basis, taking any seasonal issues into account. Key results include: The number of SMEs that applied for bank credit was 17%. A total of 5% of SMEs applied for non-bank finance.SMEs reported that sufficient internal funds was the reason for not seeking credit for 79% of firms.Of all businesses surveyed, 44% reported increased turnover in the six months up to September 2022, with 24% reporting a decrease. The biggest improvement was seen for the hotel and restaurant sector (78%). During the six months up to and including September 2022,65% of SMEs reported profit compared to 57% in 2021. In 2022, 12% reported a loss while 22% broke even. The average value of a credit application for new finance was €278,915, up notably from €208,469 in September 2021. The average value of applications for renewal/restructuring of existing finance has fallen to €396,419.61% of SMEs increased prices, 96% of which have done so to cover increased input costs.For 34% of SMEs, electricity costs are less than 21% of total energy costs. This is down from 42% on the previous wave. However, for 41% of SMEs, electricity costs are more than 60% of total energy costs. This is up from 32% on the previous wave of the survey. The average Irish SME had outstanding debt of just over €427,000, up from €400,000 on the previous wave.More than half (55%) of all SME outstanding debt was to retail banks, with the balance owed to non-bank bodies. This is down just 1% on the previous wave.Overall 40% of SMEs have no debt with construction and business services having the lowest level of debt. On the publication of the SME Credit Demand Survey Minister for Finance, Michael McGrath T.D. stated: “I welcome the results of the latest wave of the SME Credit Demand Survey. It enables Government to gain a critical understanding of the Irish SME landscape. This in turn enables Government to develop, refine and implement policy measures to support SMEs that are critical to Ireland’s economic performance and an important source of employment across the country. For example, the survey series has provided an evidence base to help inform Government’s response in supporting SMEs facing rising energy costs and the cost of doing business via the launch of the Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme (TBESS) and the forthcoming launch of the Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme (UCGS) and the Growth and Sustainability Loan Scheme (GSLS). I would like to thank the businesses that partook in this survey wave”. Ends Note for Editors: Background of Report The SME Credit Demand Survey has been conducted biannually since 2011 to monitor trends in access to credit by SMEs. Please note while the survey is conducted on a 6 monthly basis, for presentation purposes, the report uses year-on-year comparisons. The report published today presents the results from the SME Credit Demand Survey April 2022 – September 2022. Conducted by Behaviour and Attitudes, all interviews were conducted between the 11th October and 1st December 2022 and covered the period from April 2022 to September 2022. The Department has conducted the SME Credit Demand Survey in order to have an independent and statistically significant report into the Irish SME landscape and the availability of, and demand for, credit that exists for SMEs. The survey was conducted through a telephone survey covering over 1,500 businesses. It drew a carefully constructed sample from a large database of SMEs, made repeated calls to ensure a full response and asked factual questions. The full questionnaire is included in the report. The report and previous reports are available on the Department of Finance website at https://www.gov.ie/en/collection/788135-credit-demand-surveys/. The results will be used to monitor the sector, identify any changes or emerging trends and to feed into the development of policy options with colleagues in other Government Departments including Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture Food and the Marine for Government to consider. Summary and key findings This report contains the results of the Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey. All interviews were conducted between the 11th October and 1st December 2022 and covered the period from April 2022 to September 2022. Throughout the report, the most recent wave of findings (referred to as September 2022) is compared with corresponding waves. This ensures that historical comparisons are being made on a like-for-like basis, taking any seasonal issues into account. Please note that due to Covid-19 restrictions, no interviewing was possible for the same period in 2020. Demand for Bank Finance: 17% of SMEs applied for bank finance in the 6 months to September 2022. Credit demand remained unchanged in the six months to September 2022, with 17% of SMEs reported that they applied for bank finance. When this is broken down by firm size, credit demand has increased slightly among micro companies (+1%) and decreased among medium sized companies (-3%). However medium sized companies continue to have the highest level of credit demand at 22%.17% of all SMEs expected to apply for finance in the following six months, up significantly from 7% in September 2021.The main reason stated for not seeking credit in the past six months was that the company had sufficient internal, a reason cited by 79% of business not seeking credit (up from 76% in September 2021). New loans, and leasing or hire purchase were the main finance products requested by SMEs, followed by new overdrafts.Credit demand was highest for the Construction (20%), Wholesale (17%) and Business Services (17%), while lowest for Hotels & Restaurants (13%) and Manufacturing (12%).The average reported cost of credit on outstanding loans was 5.13% – an increase from 4.59% reported in September 2021. 2% of SMEs reported having missed repayments of bank loans in the period – down from 5% in September 2021.5% of SMEs requested traditional finance (e.g. leasing or hire purchase, or new loan) from a non-bank provider in the six months up to September 2022. The most common type of non-bank finance requested was leasing and hire purchase (24%), followed by new loan (20%). The Application Process Of those companies that requested bank finance, working capital (41%) and business expansion (35%) were cited as the main reasons for making a finance request, followed by investment in machinery or equipment (17%). Compared to September, bank finance requests were down for business expansion, while up for working capital.The average value of a credit application for new finance was €278,915, up from €208,469 in September 2021. The average value of applications for renewal/restructuring of existing finance was €396,419, up notably from September 2021.Of those applying for bank finance, 27% had to provide some type of collateral (down from 42% in September 2021), with the main collateral types required being buildings and personal assets. The average value of collateral required as a percentage of the loan was 53%.60% of all finance applications were processed within the stipulated 15 working days of receipt of all information from the company. The average amount of time from application to decision was 26 working days. The proportion of loans that were still pending stood at 9%. The proportion of credit applications declined stood at 10% in September 2022, largely in line with the 9% reported September 2021. But the proportion of requests that was approved fully was down from 86% in 2021 to 83% in 2022. Decline rates were lowest for the Business Services sector at 5%, with the highest decline rates seen for Hotels & Restaurants (17%).In September 2022, 22% of SMEs that were refused credit reported that they were informed of their right to an internal review – down from 42% in September 2021, with a large proportion (38%) unable to recall whether they were informed of their right to an internal review. Just 26% of those who were refused credit reported that they were informed of their right to a review by the Credit Review Office, with 41% were unsure if they were informed or not. It should be noted these calculations are based on a very small base size of just 29 respondents. SME Supports and Initiatives A large majority of SMEs are aware of Enterprise Ireland (90%), Local Enterprise Offices (80%), and the Credit Guarantee Scheme (63%). 44% were aware of the Credit Review Office, and 52% were aware of Microfinance Ireland Supports. Just 5% were not aware of any government support.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The Generation II images tease the designs produced in collaboration with EDAG Group Known for its top-level development of concept cars, prototypes and expertise in the international automotive industry, global mobility engineers EDAG was appointed by First Hydrogen in 2022 to develop design and styling for its zero emission light commercial vehicles (LCV). These first released images show the next generation’s front and rear detail. The front view features a smart digital panel, which shows the configuration of daytime running lights (DRL) designed to give the van a recognisable face and identity, as well as outstanding visibility. The rear elevation reveals vertical tail lights either side of the main cargo access point. The design follows function as it accommodates different types of doors including tailgates, barn doors and roller shutters. First Hydrogen briefed EDAG Group to assist it in the development of designs for large panel vans that can be scaled to different vehicle heights and lengths. The result will be modular vehicles that allow for customisation to suit operational use and can be employed for a wide range of applications including express delivery, grocery, construction and utilities work, emergency services and vehicle recovery. First Hydrogen revealed its Generation I fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) last year, which are now undergoing mileage accumulation and testing before commencing operational trials. From March 2023, the vans will be placed with fleet operators from the UK Aggregated Hydrogen Freight Consortium (AHFC), which include national supermarkets, utilities providers, roadside assistance and healthcare services. These real-world on road trials will enable operators to experience hydrogen transport solutions first-hand and help First Hydrogen engage with potential future customers and provide data to inform the development and production of its future vehicles. The global light commercial vehicle market size was valued at USD 480.52 billion in 2021. It is projected to reach USD 751.86 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.1% during the forecast period (2022-2030). FCEVs offer operational benefits for the zero-emission commercial van market and LCV sector with faster refuelling speeds, longer range, and larger payload, auxiliary load and towing capabilities. The First Hydrogen Generation II design will reflect this operational flexibility, ultimately supporting the Company to become leaders in efficiency and progress for zero emissions vehicles. Steve Gill, CEO of Automotive for First Hydrogen, says: “We’re thrilled to reveal this preview of our next generation of zero emission vehicles. Following the success of our Generation I demonstrator vans that prove our concept and technology capabilities, with this next series of vehicles, our goal is to provide the commercial van market with a complete solution for operational flexibility. This sneak preview indicates the careful consideration that has gone into combining aesthetics with engineering excellence; the vehicle configuration and signature light panels show a solid standout design that is iconic and will be a real head turner.” Bernat Costa, Design Director at EDAG Spain, comments: “The pure design of the light panels complements the vehicle’s functional purpose, establishing a First Hydrogen design signature and illuminating the van to improve its visibility for other road users in city and urban landscapes. This is especially important for delivery and roadside assistance vehicles, which need to make regular stops. The clean aesthetic also reflects the vehicles’ zero emissions status. We can’t wait to reveal more of the design as we progress on the project.” Further details on First Hydrogen’s next generation of green hydrogen vans will follow.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Councils seek €40 million to help beef up staffing in planning departments nationwide',\n",
       "  'text': \"COUNTY AND CITY councils have sought an additional €40 million from the Government for their planning departments, with requests for resources to beef up their staff by more than a third. Findings from a Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) report show that local authorities have asked for an extra 541 planning staff as of Q2 2022. A snapshot of this report – provided to TDs on the Oireachtas Housing Committee – says that, as of Q2 2022, there are 1,550 staff across planning departments in all councils. If provided, this would boost the total number of planning department staff across all councils to 2,091. According to the briefing note from the Department of Housing, 217 of the additional posts sought are within the planning policy area, while 212 are within development management. The remaining 112 posts are within the planning enforcement sector. The total cost of the 541 posts sought by councils is approximately €40 million, however the Government has only allocated €5 million to hiring additional planning staff. This would only add approximately 68 additional staff to planning departments nationwide. Social Democrats’ Housing Spokesperson Cian O’Callaghan said that this funding from the Government represented a “tokenistic approach” and that planning departments within local authorities are under-resourced. Leah Farrell Social Democrats' Housing Spokesperson Cian O'Callaghan Leah Farrell “Given the scale of the housing crisis we have and actually the huge deficit in terms of the provision of infrastructure alongside housing, it doesn’t make sense to be under resourcing housing,” O’Callaghan told The Journal. “If we want to get more delivery of housing and more delivery of infrastructure then resourcing planning, including forward planning, that’s an important part of it. “It’s a tokenistic approach really from the Government on this.” Sinn Féin’s Housing Spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin said that he wanted to see a “multi-annual” funding plan to help increase staffing levels across all local authority departments. “I think what we need is a plan. What I’d like to see is the Minister [Darragh O'Brien] and the LGMA engage with the Oireachtas Committee and work out what that plan is in terms of how much staff do they need when and how quickly they can be recruited,” Ó Broin said. He said that key aspects of planning policy come through both local development plans and local area plans, but that at present, councils do not have enough resources. “You’re not getting the kind of joined up infrastructure going with housing, so it’s very important that the area is properly resourced. Without that, we’re not going to get the kind of delivery, both of housing and the facilities we need with it.” There were initially cuts to staffing at planning departments nationwide following the 2008 financial crisis, with the Department estimating that 30% of staff were cut. Ó Broin told The Journal that local authorities have still not recovered their staffing levels following the crash. “Local authorities have never recovered back to their pre-2008 crash staffing levels. RollingNews.ie Sinn Féin's Housing Spokesperson Eoin Ó Broin RollingNews.ie “The local government lost 25% of its employees as a consequence of the austerity budgets post-2008, the single largest percentage loss across the public sector. “It doesn’t surprise me that the local authority managers are saying that their need for staff is far greater than what the Government has budgeted for.” The Department says that alongside recruitment of new staff, there will be a “concerted focus on upskilling, training and education”, with the Office of the Planning Regulator finalising a new training plan for councils. “Further work is underway to examine how the broader funding of the planning system and the need for greater cost recovery to ensure that funding is sustainable into the future,” the briefing note reads. Planning ‘logjam’ The briefing document comes days after a construction report showed that there is a significant “logjam” at An Bord Pleanála (ABP), with 59% Strategic Housing Development (SHD) applications in 2022 being stalled. The Mitchell McDermott Annual Construction Sector Report 2023 says that 28,786 units of housing remain undecided upon by ABP, with the delay being labelled as “unacceptable”. “Everyone knows the Board has had its issues this year but to have so many units delayed amid a housing crisis is unacceptable,” said Paul Mitchell, one of the report’s authors. “You would imagine this backlog could easily be addressed by drafting in additional temporary resources from private practice here or from the UK and we believe this should be done straight away.” SHDs have since been replaced with Large Scale Residential Developments (LRDs), which are applied for at the council level rather than directly to ABP. Concerns about the level of staffing within planning departments come as the Government last week published the Planning and Development Bill 2023, which is set to overhaul the current planning system. Under the bill, there will be a renewed focus on Local Development Plans, including extending their lifespan to ten-years.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"“I’ve seen the catastrophic effects of alcohol,” he said, outlining his experience as a liver specialist, and said that reducing the availability of alcohol is a “constructive way” of reducing harms. Sinn Féin Senator Fintan Warfield said that the measures contained in the proposed Sale of Alcohol Bill don’t simply come down to “industry vs public health”, and there are other stakeholders involved. “We’ve lost 85% of nightclubs in the last 20 years,” he said. “Hundreds of people are calling for change on this issue. Without extended hours, we’re going to lose those spaces for good.” The Government's legislation aims to revamp the country's patchwork of laws governing alcohol sales in pubs, restaurants and off-licences, some of which date back more than 200 years. Alcohol licences will be allowed for museums and galleries, while pubs will be permitted to stay open for longer until 12.30am, along with extended hours for nightclubs. The legislation has been welcomed in many quarters, including the pub and nightclub trade, and the Justice Minister has said it would help sectors “decimated” during the pandemic, and aim to diversify the night-time offerings in our towns and cities. However, there are facets to which they have taken exception or have sought clarity on. Publicans have said the removal of the extinguishment provision, whereby a new operator cannot enter the pub trade without first acquiring an existing licence, would have a damaging effect on rural pubs in particular. However, advocacy groups as well as doctors and psychiatrists have warned of the health risks of extending access to alcohol and the impact it could have on the health service and on crime. Speaking before the committee on Tuesday was the National Transport Authority, the Institute of Public Health, Mandate trade union, Alcohol Action Ireland and the Irish Community Action on Alcohol Network. The Institute of Public Health’s Ciara Reynolds said that systematic reviews of licensing hours internationally had found that “extending opening hours by even one hour increased injuries, assaults, drink-driving, car crashes and driving injuries”.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'McBurney Transport invests in 30 new trailers from SDC Ballymena based logistics company McBurney Transport is in the news again after taking delivery of 30 new Aluminium Boxvan trailers from manufacturer SDC Trailers in Toomebridge. The substantial investment signals a dedication by the company to strengthen its efficiency and operations for customers across the UK, Ireland, and Europe. Built to withstand the rigours of the road, McBurney’s new Boxvan’s feature three BPW Eco Air axles with low maintenance drum brakes and a roll stability braking system, along with internal load restraint rails, steel reinforced flooring, LED and ISO regulation lighting. The trailers are manufactured to SDC’s lightweight and durable design with a double-skin allow plank body and double-insulated roof, providing additional security and insulation of goods during transport. “We are very pleased with the new trailers from SDC Trailers,” said Norman McBurney founder McBurney Transport, “The advanced features and high-quality construction will help us to improve our operational efficiency and better serve our customers. The Boxvan trailers will join our modern fleet of over 1,300 trailers.“ Norman confirmed the recent announcement that Danish shipping and logistics company, DFDS will acquire the family-owned McBurney Transport Group in a move that will expand its network by joining one of the largest global groups in the sector. The acquisition is aligned with DFDS’ strategy of growing solutions within cold chain logistics. Headquartered in Copenhagen, DFDS operates on thirty routes, employing 11,000 staff in twenty countries connected by their ferry and logistics services. SDC’s Ireland Sales Manager, Jimmy McKernan said: “We would like to wish Norman, his wife Lynn, and the rest of the team best wishes for the future. They are a long-valued customer of SDC and it has been a pleasure to work together and support McBurney Transport over the years. McBurney’s latest order of 30 new Boxvan trailers are built to the highest standards of quality and durability, and I am confident they will serve McBurney Transport for many years to come.” Founded in 1965, McBurney Transport operates from eight locations, three in Northern Ireland, one in Ireland, three in England, and one in Scotland. Their customers range from multinational blue-chip corporations to local companies, major supermarkets, food and drink manufacturers, high street retailers as well as companies in the construction, horticulture, and industrial sectors. In Liverpool, McBurney operates a 25,000-pallet cold store, which facilitates the transport of cold chain goods throughout the UK.',\n",

       "  'title': '‘Not possible’ to make Northern Ireland Protocol work - EU law expert',\n",
       "  'text': 'A senior barrister has told a Westminster committee the Northern Ireland protocol is a question of “identity” and he does not believe it is possible to make it work. Responding to a question from the Conservative MP David Jones, Thomas Sharpe KC – an expert on EU law and a Conservative Party member – said there was a “sort of a commercial logic” to making it function for the business community in Northern Ireland. Asked specifically if it could work given its “democratic deficiency”, Mr Sharpe replied: “No, I don’t. It is a fundamental issue, who governs people in Northern Ireland. “It should be Stormont, it should be the UK parliament,” he said, agreeing the same principle should apply regarding the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the protocol. He was also asked about the role of the ECJ by the DUP MP Gavin Robinson and answered that it was “a question of identity. You just don’t want, any more than we do in GB, to have the European court telling us what the law ought to be.” A report in The Times on Wednesday suggested the EU and UK had struck a customs deal which could pave the way for a resolution of the issues around the Northern Ireland protocol, though this was subsequently dismissed by the Irish and UK governments who said no deal had been agreed. Commenting on the report, the committee chair, the Conservative MP William Cash, said there “might have been a bit of exaggeration here” and added that the members of the Committee “haven’t seen anything to scrutinise, which is the crucial issue”. Citing government sources, The Times also reported that Brussels has made concessions of the jurisdiction of the ECJ, a key sticking point in UK-EU talks. For the first time, it recognised that the ECJ could rule on Northern Ireland issues only if a case was referred by courts there, the newspaper said. Mr Robinson asked if, in Mr Sharpe’s opinion, there was a “construct which would remove ECJ whilst EU law applies to Northern Ireland or do you think, in totality, if you can be free from that legislative framework by consequence you remove ECJ”. Mr Sharpe said that “if you believe, absolutely fundamentally, whatever law you’re seeking to apply, EU or any other law, nevertheless, the Northern Ireland courts are perfectly capable of dealing with that, then you absolutely can take away the Court of Justice jurisdiction.” However, he also acknowledged it could prove legally difficulty to do so, adding that “it seems to me if you want to get rid of the Court of Justice you’ve got to get rid of the super structure of it [the protocol]”. Mr Sharpe was giving evidence on Wednesday to the European Scrutiny Committee, which is examining the UK government’s proposals to amend the Northern Ireland Protocol and the real world impacts they could have on businesses. Addressing the Committee earlier, Stuart Anderson, the Head of Public Affairs at the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the businesses had “seen the protocol impact in really significant ways, both positively, negatively and not at all, depending on the sector, the structure of supply chains and the historical nature of the business”. He said the body’s quarterly economic survey had demonstrated “quite a positive upward trend” over the last year, but added that investment was being “withheld” by some firms in Northern Ireland due to uncertainty. Fergus McReynolds, the Director of EU and International Affairs at manufacturing body Make UK, said it was “clear” that “co-operation with the EU is being held back while we are at an impasse” over the protocol and “we really need to start talking and co-operating with each other in a way that is being hampered at the moment”.

       "  'title': 'Engineers Ireland forecasts almost 8,000 sectoral jobs for 2023',\n",
       "  'text': 'Engineers Ireland’s latest employers’ survey, the first since the pandemic, has shown that a shortage of experienced engineers and the housing crisis are among the many barriers experienced by engineering employers undertaking recruitment for 2023. Damien Owens, Director General, Engineers Ireland, said: “Our recent survey has shown that 72% of member-respondents are majorly concerned about the shortage of engineers with the correct skills. These engineering employers see this shortage as the main barrier to business growth. We are all aware of the recent job cuts in the tech sector – many of them in the engineering area. It is important to stress that there are other sectors which are in urgent need of engineers e.g., construction and consultancy, with almost 8,000 new jobs anticipated in these sectors in 2023. “The engineering field is one of the most important in our society. Engineering touches the lives of everyone, providing creative solutions to societal needs from tangible works such as bridges and flood defences, to heart stents and prostheses as well as the invisible technology that is all around us. But there is a problem: there are not enough skilled engineers to meet demand. The skills shortage is nothing new. In fact, it has been an issue for years. To try and retain or seek talent, companies are upskilling, maintaining hybrid working, where possible and attracting talent from overseas.” The professional body for engineers has also warned that the shortage of engineers could potentially undermine the Government’s Project Ireland 2040 goals and ambitions. Project Ireland 2040 is made up of the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan 2021-2030. “In Project Ireland 2040, the Government has committed to actions on climate change and a ready supply of talented engineers will be fundamental to realising these goals. In 2023, the reality is that the number of students moving into third-level engineering and the technology sectors needs to be much larger to meet employers’ future needs for graduates. “If we don’t address the skills shortage soon, it could have negative effects on our economy and society. We urgently need more young people choosing careers in engineering. I would therefore strongly encourage students making their CAO choices, and particularly young women, to consider a career in engineering and the fantastic and expanding opportunities that exist in the sector,” Mr Owens continued. This call to action has come in advance of the CAO deadline of Wednesday, 1 February, which marks the application closing date for undergraduate courses. Damien Owens also said that an engineering apprenticeship, with many offering an ‘earn and learn’ experience, is an exciting opportunity for Leaving Certificate students who have an interest in engineering as a career, adding that: “An engineering apprenticeship can also be a proven way for employers to develop talent for their company, as well as opening up new and rewarding careers, with learning grounded in practical experience.” In addition to encouraging Leaving Certificate students to consider a career in engineering, Engineers Ireland is also calling on engineering firms, companies big and small, libraries, local authorities, schools, and third-level institutions nationwide to get involved in STEPS Engineers Week 2023. Taking place from 4-10 March 2023, STEPS Engineers Week provides primary and secondary school students with the opportunity to discover engineering through events and activities facilitated by their teachers, parents, and local community. The week-long celebration of the engineering profession is coordinated by Engineers Ireland’s STEPS programme – a non-profit outreach programme that promotes interest and awareness in engineering to school students – and is funded by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and industry leaders Arup, the EPA, ESB, Intel and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII).',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Irish economy has motored through a series of global crises – Brexit, the pandemic, soaring inflation – proving itself more resilient than anyone, even policymakers, could have predicted. It would be ironic, then, if it foundered on the domestic issue of housing. The sharp bounceback in activity since Covid appears to have brought matters to a head, with companies saying they are unable to expand, take on new orders or hire staff because of the lack of rental accommodation and the constraint that this puts on their business. Business leaders claim we have reached a tipping point on the issue, and that unless something is done to improve availability and affordability, Ireland’s jobs-rich growth model will stall. In a report this week, employers’ group Ibec said the shortage of housing had become a “critical barrier to continued growth and development” in the economy. An inadequate supply of affordable housing, it said, “was the single largest impediment to attracting and retaining talented workers, without whom business investment and expansions are not possible”. Padraig O’Neill, the managing director of Unum’s Technology Centre in Carlow town, a tech campus for US insurance giant Unum, says there are second-hand properties to buy in Carlow town and the surrounding area but there is little or no available rental property. At best, there are two to three properties available on property website Daft on any given day, he says. “The majority of the people we’re hiring are in the younger age bracket so they’re looking to rent not buy,” O’Neill says. “The culture of the company – being around experienced people, being able to learn – is being hindered because so many face long commutes or have to work remotely.” Unum currently employs about 230 staff, doubling its workforce during the pandemic, and offers flexible working. “We recruit a lot from surrounding colleges in Maynooth, Waterford and Carlow,” he says, noting that those from Maynooth and Waterford struggle to get accommodation locally. “We’re trying to build a brand in those colleges – one that suggests Unum Technology in Carlow is a great place to go for your internship [the company converts about 80 per cent of its interns into full-time employees] – but if it involves a two-hour commute, then that can really dampen the overall experience.” The exodus of smaller landlords from the market – a key factor driving the current undersupply of rental property – is particularly evident in Carlow, according to O’Neill. In a recent report, Daft said there were just 1,087 homes available to rent nationally on its website as of November 1st last, down about 25 per cent on the same date last year, and just 345 in Dublin. According to the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI), about 40 per cent of property sales in the final three months of last year involved landlords selling their investment properties. The SCSI linked the exodus to “overly complex” rent legislation, low rental returns, and compliance with “onerous” housing standards. John O’Flynn, general manager of the five-star Fota Island Resort in east Cork, says the biggest challenge for the business is the rental market. “Typically at this time of the year, we would be going out to the different culinary colleges in Europe to bring in chefs for summer placements, but we just cannot secure a short-term rental or a long-term rental of any description,” he says. Whether employees can get accommodation in the local area has become a bigger issue for them than salaries and there is now an onus on the employer to provide the accommodation, O’Flynn says. While the hotel provides a certain cohort of staff with accommodation, the business has long since exhausted this option. O’Flynn says the big upturn in economic activity since Covid has generated an unrealisable demand for rental property. Demand in the hospitality industry (for leisure holidays, weekend breaks, corporate events) has never been as strong, he adds, but housing has “become a real barrier for us”. [ Merrion Hotel looks to provide staff accommodation close to five-star property ] He also highlighted a new phenomenon, with some construction companies working in the Cork area now using the Fota resort to house staff on a temporary basis for the duration of a project – and paying a premium to do so. “We wouldn’t have seen this type of business before,” O’Flynn says. From an employer perspective, there is a need to reinvigorate the policy drive around the availability and affordability of housing— Fergal O'Brien Ibec’s “Better Housing, Better Business” report, published on Monday, said the State’s housing crisis had increasingly become a concern in relation to cohesion in the workplace and society more broadly. “Younger workers, in particular, are financially pressed by ever-higher rents and the receding prospect of homeownership. This ultimately spills over into issues around well-being and productivity in the workplace,” it said. “Ibec members have detailed struggles to us when trying to fill key roles due to a lack of adequate affordable accommodation,” the organisation said. It called on the Government to urgently deliver policies to speed up the delivery of housing and to improve viability and affordability, including a temporary VAT refund to offset rising construction costs; and the introduction of a State fund, set up with proceeds from the Local Property Tax, to subvent the cost of levies for new homes. Ibec says up to 20,000 social, cost-rental and affordable homes should be provided each year. While new home completions rose to almost 30,000 last year, exceeding the Government’s 24,600 target, the 9,000 social affordable housing targets won’t be met. Unpublished research by the Housing Commission also suggests that the State may need up to 62,000 homes built per year until 2050 to meet demand – almost double the annual target of 33,000 contained in the Government’s Housing for All plan. Ibec urged the Government to progress its new Planning and Development Bill, which aims to overhaul planning here, amid complaints from industry that the system is entirely under-resourced and too slow. “From an employer perspective, there is a need to reinvigorate the policy drive around the availability and affordability of housing,” Ibec’s director of lobbying and influence Fergal O’Brien said. Ireland is not unique in facing a housing crisis. However, as a small, globalised economy, the availability of accommodation is an important economic enabler— AmCham chief executive Mark Redmon “This will require a suite of measures to improve the viability and affordability of homebuilding, such as addressing emerging financing deficits, reform of the planning and procurement system to speed delivery, a ramping up of ambition in affordable and cost-rental housing, and significant investment in skills and modern methods of construction,” Mr O’Brien said. Patrick Mulholland, managing director of medical devices company VistaMed, which is based in Carrick-on-Shannon in Co Leitrim, says it’s not the cost but the availability of housing that is proving the biggest headache for the company. The lack of supply is a constraint on growth, he says. The company has had to take a much more active role in securing accommodation for workers, including providing financial guarantees to landlords. VistaMed, which already employs 670 staff, is planning to recruit an additional 50 people over the next 10 months but that’s likely to prove difficult in the current climate, Mulholland says, Beyond that point, he believes housing will limit the company’s expansion. “I simply can’t see us going beyond 750 unless there’s a major shift in housing availability,” he says. “Housing will limit what business we can take on going forward. That’s the bottom line. As a global company, we would look for other destinations – other than Ireland – if we’re unable to locate the workforce here.” The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, which represents US business interests here, says it has consistently highlighted the delivery of housing as a key issue when it comes to maintaining current and securing future investment in Ireland. In a recent survey of member companies, 98 per cent said the availability of residential accommodation was important to maintaining FDI (foreign direct investment) employment in Ireland. “Ireland is not unique in facing a housing crisis. However, as a small, globalised economy, the availability of accommodation is an important economic enabler,” AmCham chief executive Mark Redmond says. “AmCham has been consistent in its engagement with Government in recommending a continued focus on enabling the on-time delivery of commitments under the Housing for All plan and the continued prioritisation of planning and capital investment in accommodation provision,” he adds, noting that reform of the planning process is key in supporting the development of housing and business growth. Simon McKeever, chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, says: “A significant issue that has come more to the fore over the last number of months amongst Irish Exporters Association members is housing. Inflation and the cost of doing business are already pressing issues, but the acquisition and retention of talent is becoming a concern. “Companies are worried about the lack of housing and the cost of it and the impact this is having on their ability to be able to attract and retain talent, particularly when you get into more rural areas,” he adds. A recurring problem in Ireland has been the stress on infrastructure from a massive expansion of the private sector. Since 2014, the Irish economy has grown by more than 50 per cent, largely as a result of a spike in investment and employment almost exclusively in the private sector. The surge has created more than 400,000 jobs – 25 in the private sector for every one in the public sector – but a myriad of bottlenecks across the economy. Housing is perhaps the most obvious manifestation of this.\",\n",

       "  'title': 'Minister Harris welcomes the live launch of Safe Pass Renewal online  - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': 'Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science Simon Harris TD has today (3 February 2023) welcomed the official launch of Safe Pass Renewal online. Safe Pass Renewal was announced by Minister Harris in December 2022 in line with Housing for All objectives to reduce barriers to careers in construction. Wednesday marked the launch of the live online renewal system on the SOLAS website. Safe Pass Renewal removes the need to take a full day off work, and significantly reduces waiting times for current card holders. Speaking today, Minister Harris said: “I am delighted that Safe Pass Renewal is officially live and available to current Safe Pass card holders. They now have the opportunity to renew their cards in a quick, efficient and streamlined manner. “This initiative is an important milestone in my Department’s response to Housing for All as it works to remove barriers and increase participation in, and engagement with, our construction sector. “In addition, the cost to renew online is half the cost of an in-person assessment and only takes 45 minutes, meaning our workers won’t miss out on a day’s wages.” Safe Pass Renewal is a self-directed learning model, where candidates can access revision material and undertake the test in a registered and controlled test centre. Safe Pass Renewal assessments will take place in one of 30 approved Pearson VUE exam centres which are located throughout the country. The online renewal costs €93.84 and consists of 50 multiple choice questions to be answered within 45 minutes. Following a review of the Safe Pass Renewal process, the Questions and Answers Booklet fee of €12 has now been waived, furthering the cost-effectiveness of this option to those looking to renew. Card holders can still continue to renew their cards through the existing tutor lead programme delivered in a classroom setting, if they wish to do so. Minister Harris added: “I’d like to reiterate my thanks to all stakeholders who assisted us in developing Safe Pass Renewal and bringing it on stream. SOLAS, CIF Trade Unions and members of the Construction Industry Advisory Group have all been crucial in the development of this initiative.” Andrew Brownlee, CEO of SOLAS, said: I am pleased to welcome this new streamlines system which will benefit and support the broader construction sector and enable a faster, more cost-efficient method to renew Safe Pass cards for all workers in construction. “Safe Pass has been a vital cornerstone in safeguarding the health and safety of our construction sector for many years now. “This important step forward will provide an alternative model that reduces costs, days off site, and time for workers who hold a Safe Pass card. “Lots more information about this new system and Safe Pass itself can be found online as www.solas.ie/safepass.” ENDS',\n",

       "  'text': 'The FTSE 100 fell back from Friday’s record high in a dent for the recent recovery in trading sentiment. Surging US jobs figures from Friday and a hawkish speech by Bank of England rate-setter Catherine Mann indicated that there is still room for further interest rate increases.London stocks slid on Monday as a result, with housebuilders among those falling after PMI construction figures showed the weakest sector performance for almost three years.By the end of the day, London’s top index had declined by 65.09 points, or 0.82%, to 7,836.71p.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: “European markets have taken a step back today as the aftermath of Friday’s bumper US payrolls continues to reverberate through the market.“The FTSE 100, having hit a new record high last week, has slipped back, along with the rest of Europe’s markets, as yields continue to rise, building on the surge we saw on Friday.“External monetary policy committee member Catherine Mann, who is the main hawk on the Bank of England rate-setting committee, has added to the upward pressure on bond yields by saying that rates in the UK will have to continue to rise, and that it is better to lean towards over-tightening than being cautious.”Weakness early doors from the Asian market, particularly among technology and property stocks, leaked immediately into trading sentiment across Europe.The Dax closed down 0.84% and France’s Cac 40 fell by 1.34% by the close.In the US, the main markets picked up where they left off on Friday to drop in the face of rising yields.Meanwhile, sterling hit its lowest against the dollar for a month after the US greenback continued to see the benefits of the bumper payroll report.The pound was down 0.39% against the dollar at 1.200 and was 0.34% higher against the euro at 1.120 at the close.In company news, Superdry moved higher after founder and chief executive Julian Dunkerton upped his stake in the fashion retailer, despite denying reports that he is planning to take the company private just days earlier.The group said Mr Dunkerton has increased his stake in the company to 24.3% from 23.9%. As a result, shares in the business improved by 2.4p to 123.4p.Elsewhere in retail, investors were less positive about Frasers after reports the Sports Direct parent firm could buy two UK shopping centres for around £100 million.The Sunday Times reported that the Mike Ashley-founded operation is in advanced talks to buy The Mall in Luton and is also considering a deal for the Overgate centre in Dundee.Frasers shares moved 9.5p lower to 793.5p on Monday.The price of oil rebounded from its lowest levels in three weeks amid concerns about how the earthquake in Turkey could impact nearby oil terminals.Brent crude oil increased by 0.85% to 80.62 US dollars (£67.14) per barrel when the London markets closed.The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 were Airtel Africa, up 4p at 117.4p, Centrica, up 1.7p at 96.96p, GSK, up 21.4p at 1,461p, Fresnillo, up 10.6p at 827.4p, and National Grid, up 6p at 1,040p.The biggest fallers of the session were Prudential, down 64.5p at 1,289.5p, Ocado Group, down 24.8p at 713.8p, Hargreaves Lansdown, down 31.2p at 918.4p, BT, down 4.3p at 130.35p, and Land Securities, down 20.6p at 721.2p.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The number of job opportunities in Kilkenny will grow by 15% in the coming year, according to a new forecast from FRS Recruitment, one of the country’s leading recruitment agencies. This follows on from the 9% increase experienced in Kilkenny in 2022. While Kilkenny experienced a significant level of growth in 2022, the counties to experience the highest increases included Dublin (up 36%), Clare (up 31%), Wicklow (up 34%), Sligo (up 15%), Cork (up 15%) and Roscommon, which recorded the highest year on year increase with the number of roles more than doubling (up 101%). 18 of the 26 counties in the Republic experienced an increase in openings in 2022. The largest decreases came in Kerry (down 10%), Leitrim, (down 9%) and Louth (down 7%). [articlepreview id=\"1029527\" link=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/sport/1029527/success-at-home-and-abroad-for-kilkenny-athletes.html\"] Nationally the number of job postings handled by FRS Recruitment rose by 32% in 2022, reaching a total of 107,802 – up from 81,528 in 2021. Year on year the monthly increase was across 11 of the 12 months and illustrated the return of the market to post pandemic normality, with the level of jobs aligning with 2019, the last pre Covid year of activity. Despite the surge in opportunities available, the number of people applying for jobs was down last year. FRS Recruitment recorded a total of 123,305 job responses in 2022 as it became a “candidates’ market” in some sectors. This meant the average response rate per role was at 1.14, down from 1.66 in 2021. On a sub sector level the largest increase in roles experienced in 2022 was in Banking & Financial Services, which were up 106%. This was followed by opportunities in IT – Software Development (up 67%) and IT – Support Services (up 46%). Significant growth was also recorded in arts, entertainment and recreation (up 43%), education & training (up 31%) and professional services & practices (up 25%). FRS Recruitment is also forecasting further growth in IT, construction and healthcare recruitment for the year ahead, describing these sectors as “relatively inelastic”. [articlepreview id=\"1028981\" link=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/home/1028981/graignamanagh-named-in-top-ten-most-charming-irish-villages.html\"] The analysis is contained in FRS Recruitment’s ‘2022 Review and 2023 Trend Forecast’ Report. Speaking about the report, Lynne McCormack, General Manager with FRS Recruitment said, “We are confident that we will see further growth in recruitment opportunities in Kilkenny for the year ahead. We experienced a strong year in Kilkenny last year and our belief is that this will continue over the coming 12 months. “Both in Kilkenny and nationally we believe there will be strong opportunities in the IT, healthcare and construction sectors. There has been such a build-up in openings across these sectors over recent years that they have become relatively inelastic and that will continue throughout 2023. Not all parts of the economy will rise in 2023, but we are very optimistic about the prospects in those particular sectors. [articlepreview id=\"1027526\" link=\"https://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/what-s-on/1027526/alone-to-host-valentine-s-afternoon-tea-party-with-kilkenny-lions-club.html\"] “Another trend we saw in Kilkenny and across the economy last year was that the level of applications did not keep up with the number of openings. With the economy reaching a 20 year low for unemployment and nearing full employment, this impacted the market. For some high demand sectors it became a candidate’s market. This, coupled with the rising cost of living, meant significant pressure on salaries in some high demand sectors over 2022. With the economy likely to be less buoyant in the next year, we expect this pressure will diminish as candidates in Kilkenny and nationally focus more on job security and work life balance considerations,” Ms. McCormack concluded.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Searches for part-time and weekend work soar amid cost-of-living squeeze',\n",
       "  'text': 'Searches for part-time and casual work surged in 2022, according to Indeed, with the recruitment company citing the impact of inflation on the cost of living. New data from the job site suggests there has been a “noticeable uptick” in job searches for part-time and weekend work, as well as jobs requiring no experience. Indeed said this increase likely reflected the need for those normally on the outskirts of the job market – such as the long-term unemployed or younger people – to enter or rejoin the workforce due to the financial squeeze felt from rising inflation. The top two searches in Ireland in 2022 were “visa sponsorship, healthcare assistant”, which rocketed 532 per cent, and “visa sponsorship, elderly care”, up 421 per cent. “Working visa sponsorship” came in at number six on its chart, up 214 per cent. Indeed said this could largely be attributed to inward searches for these positions from abroad, and echoes previous research that indicated that the Republic is one of only five European countries experiencing a “brain gain”, with more inward job searches from overseas than the reverse. Indeed’s latest wage tracker figures point to a general slowdown in wage growth to 4.4 per cent in the Irish labour market in December, indicating that wage growth rates have fallen below their 2022 peaks and remain well below the 8.2 per cent inflation rate recorded in the final month of last year. “These trends clearly show that jobseekers are feeling the pinch right now as wage growth sits at roughly half of inflation rates. Salary, benefits and job security are the main priorities for them when considering their career. However it’s possible we may see less frequent job-hopping as people become wary of moving in an uncertain environment,” said Jack Kennedy, economist at Indeed. “Rising searches for part-time and weekend work potentially reflects that people who need flexibility, such as parents, students, or people who are semi-retired, want to engage in the workforce in a way that can fit into their lives,” he said. Meanwhile, FRS Recruitment is forecasting growth in job postings in IT, construction and healthcare, with the company’s general manager Lynne McCormack saying there is “pent up demand” in these sectors. “In the IT sector, for example, even though there been some really significant and disappointing job redundancies announced by some of the major tech companies in recent months, we believe this will create movement in the market as smaller employers see this as an opportunity to source difficult-to-find, highly skilled talent.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'No plastic bottles, cups or cutlery: UCC eliminates single-use materials from campus',\n",
       "  'text': 'University College Cork (UCC) is eliminating all single-use plastic throughout restaurants, shops and vending machines as part of a wider drive to create a more sustainable campus. The university, which published its five-year strategic plan on Tuesday, is also creating the first dedicated sustainability and climate action office in Ireland’s higher education sector. To assist with the push to go plastic-free, water refill stations have been placed across campus, thousands of reusable cups have been handed out to staff and students and mini dishwashers have been installed across various locations. UCC president Professor John O’Halloran said “people and the planet” are at the heart of its development plans for the campus. “Together the UCC community has created a roadmap that will secure our future so that we can continue to inspire and shape future generations, while also providing the expertise and insight to meet the challenges our society faces,” he said, at the launch of the report on Tuesday. The move to go plastic-free came from students, he said, and has given the university a chance to become an “experimental ground” for how the rest of society can take similar measures. “This is a community of 25,000 students, 3,500 staff ... We estimate that UCC is the 14th largest settlement in the country,” he said. The new office of sustainability and climate action will be tasked to deliver on a range of environmental targets, while ensuring learning, teaching, research and operations lead the transition to a more sustainable future. The blueprint for the university also places a big focus on developing new postgraduate programmes, boosting international student numbers and widening student access to higher education. It plans to offer increased pathways into university courses from further education and is seeking to widen access to postgraduate education through philanthropy and other sources. Prof O’Halloran said about 23 per cent of its students come from “non-traditional pathways” and about 47 per cent of students at the university avail of student grants. It was important, he said, to ensure postgraduate options are made more accessible for all students. “The key is making sure that funding is not a barrier ... I’m a first generate graduate myself and a lot of support will be required,” he said. “We’re not in favour of students loans or anything like that. ... I lived in the US and we’ve seen the damage that it creates.” He said he was hopeful that the Government will deliver on promised additional funding for the sector to help ensure universities can provide all the supported needed for new students. Prof O’Halloran estimated that while universities received about €4,000 per student in Government funding about 10-15 years ago, this has since dwindled to about €1,500. Yet, over the same time period, the student intake has grown more complex with additional needs. On the question of student accommodation, he said the college’s Crow’s Nest development at Victoria Cross is close to completion and the university aims to provide a total of 2,000 student beds within the time frame of the strategic plan. Thousands of other beds are available in private, purpose-built student accommodation. “Affordability rather than availability is the issue,” he said, adding that its campus-based accommodation was pitched below competitor’s prices. The strategic plan also includes a programme of research prioritisation coupled with an academic recruitment across ten indicative areas of strategic importance. UCC said it has been actively recruiting leading researchers globally and placing a strong emphasis on attracting and supporting early career researchers. Prof O’Halloran said the university’s research is now focused on the “global grand challenges” as identified by the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. There are also plans to create a student forum, or a representative assembly of students, to enable constructive consultation and participation with university leaders.',\n",

       "  'text': 'An EU-wide shortage of qualified mechanics is creating “extraordinary pressure” for the National Car Test (NCT) service while a “driver availability” issue is hampering plans for the redesign of the Dublin bus network, according to a briefing document prepared for Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan. The document, drafted in December and published on Tuesday, outlines how the department is continuing to progress three public transport “megaprojects” – BusConnects, Dart+ and MetroLink – and states that “assuming timely planning approval from An Bord Pleanála” as well as other matters, construction work on the MetroLink could start in late 2025 and it could begin operating in the early 2030s. [ Driving examiners ‘put at risk’ after ruling that cars without NCT can be used for tests ] [ Average NCT wait times still rising amid confusion over ‘free tests’ ] The document notes backlogs in the NCT system have been receiving “prolonged media and political scrutiny” since the start of last year. “The contractor is providing additional vehicle inspectors from its Spanish operation,” the report notes, while the Road Safety Authority (RSA) has approved a pilot scheme to use additional inspection staff for automated test elements, and non-EU testers are receiving training. There will be no reduction in the quality of the tests being carried out, according to the report, and the department has received assurances from the RSA that the appointment of additional resources will not result in the loss of any existing jobs. Investment in public transport, which was €524 million in 2020, is expected to grow to €851 million this year, while from 2021 to 2025 it is envisaged that the equivalent of 20 per cent of the 2020 transport capital budget – approximately €360 million annually – will be invested in walking and cycling infrastructure on a whole-of-government basis, according to the report. [ Motorists entitled to free NCT tests over delays, but none have been offered, TD says ] [ NCT mechanics reject plan to hire auxiliary staff in effort to tackle backlog ] Hundreds of villages and rural areas are to be connected to the national bus network as part of a five-year Connecting Ireland plan. Priority is being given to areas where “the population and transport demands have increased due to the requirement to house Ukrainian refugees in rural locations”. In order to achieve the “ambitious levels of emissions reduction required in transport”, base demand is among the matters that have to be addressed, according to the report. A National Demand Management Strategy, to be developed this year, will consider a broad range of measures and their sequencing and timing, with the measures mentioned in the report including the removal of free workplace parking, increased parking charges, congestion and road-user charges, and increased fossil fuel prices. On aviation, the report notes that the pandemic caused airline passenger numbers to plummet globally but that a recent projection by Eurocontrol envisaged Irish passenger numbers returning to 2019 levels in 2023 and throughout Europe the following year. “Recovery is ongoing, and at a pace that surpassed initial predictions,” according to the report. “While aviation’s contribution to economic development has long been acknowledged and the importance of connectivity for an island nation is well-understood, the imperative to act to reduce our emissions across all sectors is also fully recognised,” the report said. On the introduction of a tax on aviation fuels, the report says “progress continues to be very slow at EU level with varying views between member states.”',\n",

       "  'title': 'Housing for All – Q4 2022 Progress Report published - MerrionStreet',\n",
       "  'text': \"The Government today published the progress report for Quarter 4, 2022 under Housing for All, A New Housing Plan for Ireland. In the first full calendar year of the plan, almost 30,000 (29,851) new homes were completed, exceeding the target by over 20%. Construction started on 27,000 new homes in the year, the second highest since 2014. Strong activity has also been seen in the area of mortgage approvals, particularly for First Time Buyers (FTB), with recently published data showing FTB volumes at their highest levels since 2007. The supply of homes is increasing despite considerable challenges in the external environment. Since the launch of Housing for All, over 41,456 new homes have already been built. Actions during Quarter 4 include: Increased funding through the Affordable Housing Fund and the Cost Rental Equity Loan to make cost rental homes available at affordable prices. Help-to-Buy Scheme extended to the end of 2024 and consideration being given to expansion of the First Home Scheme to cover self-build housing. The Scheme, operational since July 2022, will support the purchase of 2,000 homes by eligible buyers in 2023. Funding of €94m provided to local authorities to address legacy land debts. Provision of this funding linked to the immediate development of a housing proposal, a commitment to use Modern Methods of Construction and construction to start in 2023/2024. Overall, over 30 sites have been identified for acceleration, involving over 1,500 new social homes. Launched Construct Innovate, Ireland’s Construction Technology Centre, to accelerate research and innovation in the construction sector. Publication of Report on the Analysis of Skills for Residential Construction and Retrofitting 2023-2030, along with Action Plan to attract and retain the necessary workforce – identified need for almost 51,000 new entrantsto meet the Government’s housing and retrofitting targets over the period to 2030. Developed Vacant Homes Action Plan, with several incentives available if you are turning a vacant house or building into your permanent home. €500 Rent Tax Credit for rent paid in 2022 and protection for renters by deferring any ‘no fault’ tenancy terminations from taking place this winter. Pre-Letting Expenses for landlords increased from €5,000 to €10,000, the length of time that a property must be vacant to be eligible reduced from 12 to 6 months. Publication of draft Residential Zoned Land Tax Maps as part of the implementation of the Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT). In addition, significant reform is underway including through the publication of a new Planning and Development 2023 Bill and approval by Government on General Scheme of Land Value Sharing and Urban Development Zones Bill. While progress has been strong, 2022 also saw the emergence of unprecedented challenges, leading to high inflation and rising interest rates. These issues are having a negative impact on the financial viability of home development and Government is focused on solving this through schemes such a Project Tosaigh and Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme. A new call for proposals was launched under Project Tosaigh in Q4 and the evaluation of responses is nearing completion, to be prioritised in accordance with 2023 and 2024 figures. The Housing Agency is now concluding appraisals of projects with the potential to build up to 2,100 apartments under the Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme, following the European Commission’s approval of Ireland’s State aid application for the scheme. Letters of approval will now be issued to successful applicants from the first call. Commenting on the publication of the report, the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar TD said: “Government is fully committed to reversing the trend of falling home ownership and rising homelessness. We are determined to make home ownership a reality for the many again. “This can only be achieved by increasing the supply of homes of all types. We have made good progress in the first full year of the Housing for All plan, and we will continue to work with stakeholders to accelerate and enhance the plan as we implement it. It is a comprehensive plan and, working with the Minister Darragh O'Brien, I will do all I can to drive it forward. “We need new and innovative ways to supply homes; no option will be taken off the table without due consideration. “We must apply the same spirit of determination, action and immediacy that we saw during the pandemic, to solving this social crisis.” The Tánaiste, Micheál Martin said “Homelessness is one of the greatest challenges facing our society today and a serious concern for Government. Though actions implemented in Quarter 4 such as the short-term ban on no-fault evictions, and actions taken to address the fundamental shortage of housing in our country, particularly social and affordable housing, we will turn the tide and provide homes for those in most need in our society” The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications and Minister for Transport, Eamon Ryan said: “The adoption of Modern Methods of Construction has the potential to significantly improve construction sector productivity, innovation, sustainability and costs. In December, the Government launched Construct Innovate, Ireland’s Construction Technology Centre, to accelerate research and innovation in the construction sector. Already, a series of research projects are underway. The Centre is just one of several initiatives that will further support the use and development of Modern Methods of Construction in the delivery of Housing.” The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O’Brien TD added: “We are making significant progress in tackling vacancy and dereliction. Last week I launched the Vacant Homes Action Plan which details the upcoming measures that will bring even more vacant properties back into use. The new €150 million URDF call for proposals will help local authorities transform vacant and derelict buildings and sites in order to revitalise and regenerate our cities and large towns, and deliver more housing”. Notes to Editor Housing for All ‘Housing for All’ is the Government’s housing plan for Ireland to 2030. It can be read at www.gov.ie/housingforall.

Addressing the Oireachtas committee on transport on department spending plans on Wednesday, Mr Ryan told Darren O’Rourke TD (SF Meath East) local link and town bus services represent the number one priority. “It is closing the gap where there is nothing in many instances,” he said. “Yes we should be faster but we are opening new bus services week in, week out.” The Minister said next week the National Transport Authority would present new routes that will open. “This should be the number one priority and it is,” he said. My Ryan said although road building would continue, the coming two years would see a shift in funding of two-to-one in favour of active travel and public transport. He revealed just €240.009 million of €1.387 billion earmarked for roads and road safety has been allocated to the construction of new national roads this year. Some €70 million will be spent on new regional and local road improvement schemes. Road schemes include the ongoing Dunkettle Interchange in Cork City, the N5 Westport-to-Turlough route in Co Mayo, the Listowel bypass in Co Kerry and N59 Moycullen bypass in Co Galway. Projects with planning approval that will continue to progress towards construction phase include the N28 Cork-to-Ringaskiddy road and the retendered N5 Ballaghdereen-to-Scramogue scheme in Co Roscommon. The Minister told TDs and Senators €358 million would be invested this year in “active travel” including the Safe Routes to School scheme on which the Department of Transport was working with local authorities to design and implement changes that would make it more attractive for people to chose active or public transport over the private car. “Tactical interventions in urban areas at low cost to deliver quick active travel wins,” he said. Mr Ryan said big ongoing active travel projects included the Clontarf-to-Amiens Street route in Dublin and the McCurtain street scheme in Cork. “My intention is that these demonstrator projects will pave the way for more widespread behavioural change in how we engage with transport as a society,” he said. Mr Ryan said from this year Government supports to encourage people to move to electric vehicles would switch from grants for private vehicles to investing in public EV charging infrastructure, He said BusConnects “spines” would continue to roll out with the planned introduction of South Dublin City orbital routes while planning would continue on BusConnects for regional cities. Overall, €876.504 million has been allocated to public transport including the balance of the order of 41 Intercity Railcars that will increase capacity on the intercity network. Construction will also continue on the National Train Control Centre, and tenders will be issued for the redevelopment of Ceannt station in Cork. The Cork Commuter Rail project, part-funded through the EU’s National Recovery and Resilience Programme, will also be progressed, he said. A total of €15 million is to be invested in rail and public transport accessibility projects. Mr Ryan said although ports are not directly funded by the exchequer “offshore renewable energy should be supported strategically, given its potential for addressing future energy requirements, decarbonisation, security of supply, and job creation in emerging industries of the future”. He said the demands of the offshore industry included quays with a water depth of at least 11 metres and length of between 400 and 500 metres. Although this investment would have to be made before the ports were awarded contracts to facilitate the deployment of turbines, blades and towers, it was “a leap of faith” that the port companies would have to make. Questioned by TDs and Senators on the possibility of this work going to ports such as Hamburg, Mr Ryan said Irish port infrastructure “will be delivered. It has to be”.',\n",

The work stoppages, which at least 270 Siptu members are expected to take part in, will to take place on 1 and 8 March. During the planned stoppages, Siptu members will place pickets at the Go Ahead Ireland depots in Ballymount, Dublin 12 and Naas, Co Kildare. Siptu representatives carried out a ballot for industrial action of its members employed by Go Ahead Ireland on 20 December. “In the ballot, an overwhelming majority voted for industrial action if management continued to refuse to engage on the issue of pay,” Siptu sector organiser John Murphy said. He said that following the vote, Go Ahead Ireland management agreed to attend talks at the Work Place Relations Commission but would not engage on the issue of pay. Siptu then referred the dispute to the Labour Court which it claims Go Ahead Ireland is refusing to attend. “The current collective agreement takes no account of the significant additional cost of living increases our members and their families are facing,” Murphy said. “Siptu representatives remain available to engage in constructive negotiations with management at all times.

       "  'text': 'The Minister for Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform, Paschal Donohoe TD, has today 10th February 2023, launched an updated Investment Projects and Programmes Tracker and updated MyProjectIreland interactive map. Project Ireland 2040 sets out a clear long-term strategy for public capital projects in Ireland backed by funding of €165 billion over a 10 year period as presented in the National Development Plan 2021–2030 (NDP). The updated Tracker and Map published today on http://www.gov.ie/2040, showcases the steady progress being made in the delivery of the NDP. The Tracker and Map were last published in May 2022. Speaking today, Minister Donohoe said: \"I am delighted that there continues to be significant advances made in the delivery of Project Ireland 2040. The investment tracker and interactive map provide citizens with a comprehensive overview of the capital projects being delivered in their own areas. This year my Department has increased capital investment by a further 10% to over €12 billion. This represents a solid pipeline of activity that will continue to support jobs across the construction sector.\" This Tracker update, which incorporates user-friendly dashboards, provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments that make up Project Ireland 2040. It focuses on over 320 projects and 140 programmes with estimated costs greater than €20 million. The Minister also said: \"Over the lifetime of the NDP, we are investing €165 billion in new and upgraded infrastructure that meets the needs of our growing population and enables delivery of our national priorities around critical areas such as housing, health and climate action. With the unprecedented scale of investment in the NDP, the ambition of the Government is clear. The Tracker and the Map published today demonstrate the many successes we have had in the delivery of the NDP so far. \"Delivering the NDP is a huge undertaking but we must, and will, continually strive to ensure that projects are completed on time and on budget. That is why the Government has decided to sharpen the focus on delivery even further in 2023. Reflecting its change in name, my Department is examining how the support structures and levers at Government’s disposal can be used to drive delivery, in support of my colleagues in Government who are the key players in the management and delivery of all our NDP projects. \"The Government is determined to deliver on the vision set out in the National Development Plan. Success will mean a better Ireland for the benefit of all our people.” ENDS',\n",

Limerick Twenty Thirty has also announced details of a €80m joint venture which will boost the development of the Opera Square site-wide basement and the six storey One Opera Square office building. Located at the corner of Michael Street and Ellen Street, the project is Ireland’s largest scale development site and works are scheduled be completed by 2025. Details of the joint venture, which involves Limerick Twenty Thirty and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) means that the One Opera Square project have been confirmed by the Minister for Housing, Darragh O\\'Brien, who is on a visit to Limerick this Monday. The 3.7 acre site will be transformed into a daytime employment hub, as well as offering 450,000 square feet of accommodation to the people of Limerick. Commenting, Minister O’Brien said: “Opera Square will be a transformative development for Limerick, and I’m delighted the Government has been able to support Limerick Twenty Thirty in bringing it to fruition. The regeneration and rejuvenation of our towns and cities is a key part of this government’s vision. “We are tackling vacancy and dereliction, and will continue to fund important regeneration projects in the country.” Separately to the funding announcement, Limerick Twenty Thirty has confirmed the appointment of John Sisk and Son for the design and construction of the circa 10,000sqm Opera Square site-wide basement and six storey One Opera Square office building.

Mayor of the City and County of Limerick, Cllr Francis Foley welcomed this Monday\\'s announcement: “This is a hugely significant moment for the wider Opera Square development, Limerick and, indeed, the Mid-West region. This is the moment when we can finally say that, two decades after the redevelopment of this site was first mooted by the private sector, building is now finally underway. One Opera Square is one of the flagship projects in the Opera Square programme which, together with other private and public investments already underway in Limerick, is going to transform our city centre, setting it on a new course that will make it one of the most competitive and attractive locations in Europe to live, work and play in.” Nick Ashmore, Director of ISIF, added: “This is an important step forward in our €500m investment programme to unlock the economic potential of Ireland’s five regional cities. We are delighted to show our backing for Limerick and the wider mid-west region with our biggest single investment to date from this programme. Our investment is about making Limerick an even better place for employers to create more jobs and making it an even more attractive place for people to work. Limerick has so much going for it and ISIF looks forward to backing more investments in the city and the region over the coming years.”',\n",

Duncan Smith is calling on Go-Ahead Ireland management to engage with SIPTU immediately to avoid widespread strikes and disruption across the bus network over the coming weeks.According to SIPTU, members will stage 24-hour strikes on March 1 and March 8 with pickets at the company's depots in Ballymount, Dublin and Naas.“The refusal of Go-Ahead to engage in meaningful talks on pay that will honestly take into account the impact of the cost-of-living crisis is utterly regrettable,” Labour transport spokesperson Deputy Smith said.“SIPTU members in Go-Ahead are not immune from the inflationary pressures that hundreds of thousands of workers are facing and they need to see some real light at the end of the tunnel.“The reality is that the current collective agreement takes no account whatsoever of the significant additional cost-of-living increases workers are facing. That needs to change.“Across the water, the same company has agreed a significant pay deal for its workers and the demands for a similar approach to be taken for the company’s 300 workers in Ireland is a fair and reasonable one.“The onus is now on Go-Ahead management to pull out all the stops and respect the plight of their hard-working staff.“They must immediately, meaningfully engage with union representatives and do everything in their power to avoid these unnecessary strikes,” he added.The dispute over pay has come due to rising costs facing workers and businesses nationwide.SIPTU Sector Organiser, John Murphy, added: “SIPTU representatives conducted a ballot for industrial action of our members employed by Go-Ahead Ireland on December 20.“This vote was required due to the refusal of management to engage through the normal agreed process in talks concerning an increase in pay for our members to take account of the impact of the cost-of-living crisis.“In the ballot, an overwhelming majority voted for industrial action if management continued to refuse to engage on the issue of pay. Following this vote, management did agree to attend talks at the Workplace Relations Commission.“However, at these talks it refused to engage on the pay issue separately to other matters. We then referred the dispute to the Labour Court, which the company is now refusing to attend.”SIPTU Organiser, Andrew Quigley, added: “Our members are frustrated at the refusal by management to engage constructively on the issue of pay rises.“The current collective agreement takes no account of the significant additional cost-of-living increases our members and their families are facing.“In the UK, the same company has reached an agreement for a significant increase to its employees’ pay in line with inflationary pressures. We are demanding a similar approach be taken with its over 300 employees in Ireland.”Independent.ie has contacted Go-Ahead Ireland for comment.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Minister of State for Trade Promotion and Digital Transformation, Dara Calleary, TD, today turned the sod on the site of the new Advancing Innovation in Manufacturing (AIM) Centre in Sligo. The new facility will focus on developing capability in cutting-edge manufacturing technology in companies across the Northwest region.This innovative project is driven by Atlantic Technological University (ATU), Sligo County Council and Leitrim County Council and is supported by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment administered through Enterprise Ireland.Speaking at the event today Minister Calleary said; “I am delighted to be here in Sligo to formally turn the sod on the new home for the AIM Centre at the old fire station at Market Yard. This is an ambitious, innovative project that will provide companies across the Northwest with access to new and emerging manufacturing and supply chain management technology. There is a technological revolution occurring in this important sector and it is vital that Irish enterprise is ahead of the curve in adapting to change. As well as helping businesses adapt and become more competitive, projects such as this are crucial if we are to develop a resilient enterprise ecosystem to provide high-quality jobs and employment opportunities for people to live and prosper in all regions.“I would like to acknowledge the vision of Atlantic Technological University, Sligo County Council and Leitrim County Council in championing this important project, which my Department is proud to support with funding of almost €2 million delivered through Enterprise Ireland’s Border Enterprise Development Fund.”Welcoming the commencement of construction work, Councillor Michael Clarke, Cathaoirleach, Sligo County Council, said; \"Today marks a huge step forward in bringing this very innovative and forward-looking project to fruition. I want to acknowledge the huge effort, vision and collaboration of all the key players, including the Atlantic Technological University, Enterprise Ireland, Rhatigan Architects, the contractor, Joseph McMenamin & Sons Ltd., Julie Dowling, Director of the AIM project and of course my colleagues and staff in Sligo County Council. This project has the potential to be a gamechanger for industry in Sligo and beyond, while also boosting local trade.\"Dr. Chris O’Malley, Vice President of Research, Innovation and Engagement with ATU said; “Manufacturing is undergoing a technological revolution with tens of thousands of jobs at stake across our region. ATU is delighted to collaborate with Sligo County Council, Leitrim County Council and Enterprise Ireland in taking this initiative to help our companies address that challenge, drawing on the expertise and facilities across all the ATU campuses and partner networks across the country and beyond. It’s about putting knowledge at the service of the region.”Recently appointed director of the AIM Centre, Julie Dowling said; “It is fantastic to see the renovation work on the old fire station commence. Whilst we await the use of our state-of-the art facility, several cutting-edge projects are already in-flight with businesses in the region. Currently the AIM team are operating out of Sligo ATU Innovation Centre. We have a team of experienced resources in the fields of artificial intelligence and analytics, robotics and automation, business strategy, research and engineering. Businesses are under pressure with ever changing landscapes brought about from Brexit and covid, followed by an energy crisis, global inflation, and talent retention issues. New technology can assist organisations with such challenges, and the AIM centre have the resources to help find the optimal solution for them.”Carol Gibbons, Divisional Manager, Regions and Local Enterprise, with Enterprise Ireland said; “It is really positive to see this great project coming to fruition with the formal sod turning today. I am confident that the knowledge and expertise located in the Aim Centre will be of immense benefit to companies across the Northwest region as they use emerging technology to drive productivity and competitiveness. This project is one of 11 transformative projects currently being supported by Enterprise Ireland through the Border Enterprise Development Fund, a specific initiative to support entrepreneurship in the Border counties post-Brexit.”',\n",

       "  'text': 'In its submission, The Irish Home Builders Association, a part of the Construction Industry Federation, will tell politicians that there are potentially 70,000 homes awaiting a decision by An Bord Pleanála. The association will also say that a judicial review of homes that have already been granted permission can add between €10,000 and €20,000 per unit to build costs. Housing Minister Darragh O\\'Brien\\'s bill looks to limit access to judicial reviews to those who have a material interest in a development. The statement, which will be read by the IHBA\\'s director Conor O\\'Connell, says that housing commencements, which were down 13% last year, will have fallen dramatically in the last 12 months when figures are compiled. \\'Time is money\\' \"We estimate that there are over 70,000 housing units waiting for a decision in An Bord Pleanála and in the courts, nearly two years\\' supply of homes. \"The old expression that “time is money” has never been more appropriate in the current economic environment as increases in the cost of materials, the rising interest rates, and other factors mean that the extraordinarily long delays being currently experienced in the planning and legal system results in more costs being added to a new home. \"These are adding unnecessary delays to our younger generations securing their new homes. Commencements have declined by 13% last year and we expect that planning permissions will see a dramatic decline over the last 12 months.\" Mr O\\'Connell will tell the committee that while there are many planning permissions already granted for homes, most in urban areas are for apartments. He will say apartments have \"always been a challenge to deliver due to their high delivery costs and it will be difficult to see many commence in 2023\". Objections He will say government schemes such as Project Tosaigh and the Croí Conaithe cities scheme may yield results in terms of apartment commencements in the latter half of 2023 but demand for traditional housing units remains strong and is the preference for most people. Mr O\\'Connell will tell the committee that house builders trying to deliver homes are \"concerned they may run out of permissions in areas of high demand in late 2023 and that the resourcing in the planning system is \"at a critical juncture\" and will argue for stronger safeguards around planning objections. \"We have seen objections based on the claim from individuals that their houses may be devalued. We have seen objections to housing from organisations or individuals living several hundred kilometres away from the site, we have seen politicians objecting to housing who, at the same time, are calling for more housing. This simply cannot continue if we are serious about an inclusive and harmonious society where the provision of housing is facilitated by the state with appropriate legislation and procedures.\" Representatives of Property Industry Ireland, the Ibec group for the construction and property sectors, will tell the committee that finance has become an issue for builders and potential homebuyers. \"In the delivery of new homes, homebuilders face many challenges. At present, the growth in input cost inflation is impacting on viability and the new home pipeline. Financing is now a particular constraint. Interest rate rises have had a major impact. There are supports for owner-occupiers, but a critical challenge will be in the delivery of homes to rent. Uncertainty can also play a key role in homebuilders decision-making.\"',\n",

       "  'text': 'Joint agents Cushman & Wakefield and Sherry FitzGerald New Homes are guiding a price of €59 million for the Rockpoint apartment development in Blackrock, Co Dublin. The scheme, which is under construction currently and due for practical completion in the final quarter of this year, will comprise a total of 91 apartments distributed across two blocks. Aimed towards the upper end of the private rented sector market, the development will consist of a mix of 49 one-bedroom apartments, 38 two-bedroom apartments and three three-bedroom units, along with 71 underground car-parking spaces. Rockpoint is well located in Blackrock and just 7km southeast of Dublin city centre. The scheme is situated just off the Frascati Road (N31) and within a short walk of both Seapoint and Blackrock Dart stations and Blackrock Village itself. While the €59 million being sought for the development equates to a significant average price of €648,351 per unit, the selling agents say they expect rents in Rockpoint to range from €2,600 to over €4,000 for the larger units. The portfolio is being offered to the market by way of a forward-purchase agreement on behalf of Seabren Developments – the company led by Michael Moran of the Red Cow Moran Hotel. Seabren acquired the 0.5-hectare Rockpoint site from developer Pat Crean’s Marlet Property Group in 2020 for about €7.5 million. At the time of that sale the former Europa Garage lands had planning permission in place for a smaller development of 42 apartments and nine houses. Seabren secured planning permission for the present scheme from An Bord Pleanála in 2021 in the face of objections from a number of parties including the former president of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.',\n",

Even the enemy’s more fortified second line of defence could not stop the breakthrough by the Russian military.” Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of the partly occupied Luhansk region, said claims that Russian troops had pushed Kyiv’s forces back to the border of the province “do not correspond to reality – our forces are holding the line”. “We see there is an escalation, especially in the direction of Bilohorivka and Kreminna. There is a lot of shelling and aircraft are already involved – the Russians are constantly attacking in waves from different sides,” he added. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the most intense fighting was now taking place around the towns of Bakhmut and Vuhledar in the Donetsk region. Describing Bakhmut as a “living wall” that holds back Russian forces, he said Ukraine’s people “are standing strong, defending themselves resolutely, and they understand they are a fortress that allows Ukraine to prepare for the de-occupation of all its territories”. Referring to the February 24th anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of his country, Mr Zelenskiy said “there is a feeling that the new year in Ukraine now starts on the 24th… We want this year to be a year of victory.” After a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said recent western pledges of tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, missile systems and other modern weaponry were intended to ensure that Ukraine’s forces “can be decisive on the battlefield in their upcoming offensive”. “And so with that additional capability, better trained troops, platforms that can perform a lot better in this environment, I think they’ll have a real good chance at making a pretty significant difference on the battlefield and establishing the initiative, and being able to exploit that initiative,” he added. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said member states were stepping up production of ordnance in response to Ukraine’s use of “an enormous quantity of allied ammunition” which was “depleting our stockpiles”. “So the production of, for instance, artillery shells… is now increasing, and that enables us to both replenish our own stocks… but also to continue to provide support to Ukraine,” he explained. “We have seen the big need… and now we see that contracts are signed and production is ramping up.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen unveiled proposals to undermine Moscow’s ability to wage war in Ukraine by imposing export bans worth €11 billion, which would “deprive the Russian economy of critical technology and industrial goods”. The sanctions would hit electronics, specialised vehicles, machine parts, spare parts for trucks and jet engines, and goods for the construction sector that could be used by the Russian military, including antennas and cranes. Dual-use and advanced technologies are also to be hit, with 47 electrical components that can potentially be used to power Russian drones, missiles and helicopters set to be barred from export to Russia, along with certain rare earth materials and thermal cameras.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Dublin City Council pays 40% over the odds for social housing, audit finds',\n",
       "  'text': 'Dublin City Council has been paying in excess of 40 per cent more for the construction of social housing than private sector developers, an independent audit of more than 1,000 Dublin homes has found. Council officials had been “severely restricted” in their ability to control costs within Government and EU procurement rules and systems, according to the report by public management consultancy Seán Ó Riordáin and Associates Ltd and Trinity College economics professor Ronan Lyons. The “review of the construction costs associated with the council’s building of housing units” was commissioned by the council after concerns were raised in 2021 that it was paying a “premium” for the construction of social housing with costs that were significantly higher than those achieved by approved housing bodies (AHBs) and private developers. The analysis of 28 housing schemes across the three sectors, with a total of 1,023 homes built between 2019 and the end of last year, found the council was paying 23 per cent more than AHBs and 44 per cent more than private developers for a similar two-bedroom apartment. When the all-in costs of development were taken into account, and the apartments weighted for their size, the review found one-bedroom apartments provided directly by council cost €335,000, 11 per cent above the equivalent figure for AHBs (€303,000) and 34 per cent above the figure for “Part Vs “(€250,000). Under Part V legislation developers are required to allocate a number of homes for sale to local authorities for social housing. For two-bedroom homes, the council construction costs of €514,000 were 23 per cent above the AHB average of €418,000 and 44 per cent above the Part V average €358,000. The council paid an average of €600,000 for the construction of three-bedroom apartments during this period. However, as only a small number of “non-council” three-bedroom properties were built during the three-year period, they were excluded from the analysis. The difference in costs could, in part, be attributed to the differing nature of the projects, the report said. Council schemes were generally smaller, with an average of 43 homes compared with a private sector average of 180, of which 18 were set aside for social housing. Council schemes were typically regeneration or “brownfield” sites which were more costly to build on than private developers’ greenfield sites. Nonetheless, “it would not be appropriate to conclude that cost differentials between public and private delivery can be explained entirely by scale... and wider project nature”, the report said. “Issues such as the application of public procurement rules and the impact of policy shifts, application of differing standards in the use of construction materials, etc, can and do impact upon the cost environment for both public and private delivery of construction.” In addition, it said “councils do not have the option of entering into long-term commercial relationships where long-run production of construction materials and predetermined fixtures and fittings can be facilitated as is the case for private-led investment”. The systems used to develop these homes meant the capacity for council officials “to make substantive decisions around cost control was severely restricted, particularly when there were changes in regulatory specifications and requirements at a national level that had an impact on costs”. Following the introduction of the Government’s Housing For All policy, an international cost management framework was being introduced to local authorities which should assist in the council controlling costs, the report concluded. Fine Gael councillor James Geoghegan said it was “a serious concern that proper accounting and cost control measures and procedures were not in place” when these homes were built. “Because of how these projects were managed, the council was not able to maintain control over costs, and what this report shows is that Dublin City Council paid a premium price for that.”',\n",

One appeal, originally recorded with Limerick County Council from a member of the public has now also been received by An Bord Pleanála, to try and hinder the development due for the Old Dublin Road. Primary concerns for the site included; denisty and size, location and height in relation to existing properties, provision for parking, applicant title description and a spacial note in relation to existing water mains supply. Reasons for the appeal included; proposal not in fitting with surrounding neighbourhood, apartment blocks too high, potential structural impact on homes and water supply from construction activities, and an insufficient provision for parking. A decision on the appeal is due to be decided by May 23, 2023.

The applicants for development, Kearock Investments, have previously warned that even with other developments under way, Limerick is facing a deficit of 2,200 student bed spaces by the academic year 2024/2025. Previously, Mr Kearney had told Limerick Live: “The scheme provides for much-needed purpose-built student accommodation in close proximity to the UL campus at Plassey. “At present, there is a substantial deficit in the quantum of student accommodation available. Dedicated facilities like this one will serve to free up traditional housing for the private rented sector.” In planning documents to the local authority, the developer stated that outside of the college academic year, the facility may be used for tourist accommodation, and those studying at summer schools in Limerick.',\n",

China Renaissance Holdings said in a filing to Hong Kong’s stock exchange on Thursday that it had been unable to contact Mr Bao, who has worked on major deals including e-commerce company JD.com’s two billion dollar (£1.6 billion) initial public offering and the public listing of short video platform Kuaishou in Hong Kong.The company said that it was “not aware of any information that indicates Mr Bao’s unavailability” was related to the business of the group.Mr Bao’s disappearance follows a crackdown on big technology companies in the past two years that officials in China said had been completed.Shares in China Renaissance fell as much as 50% on Friday in Hong Kong. They were down about 28% in the afternoon.China Renaissance did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.A foreign ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin, said he was not aware of the situation when asked at a news briefing.“I would like to stress that China is a country under rule of law, and the Chinese government protects the rights and interests of Chinese citizens in accordance with law,” he said.Mr Bao’s disappearance comes months after former China Renaissance president Cong Lin was taken away by Chinese authorities in September last year, according to Chinese news media outlet Caixin, which first reported the news.Investigations in China targeting the financial sector have ensnared dozens of officials and finance executives at institutions such as Everbright Securities, China Construction Bank and major bank ICBC.Mr Bao earlier worked at Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley.

       "  'text': 'Macra has criticised the omission of construction costs for new milking parlours under the new Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS). The Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) yesterday (Monday, February 20) published details of TAMS 3, including the Dairy Equipment Scheme (DES), which details the eligible items and the reference costs. Tranche 1 of the €370 million scheme will open on Wednesday (February 22) with solar panels on farms being the first available investment. Other investments will become available on a phased basis during Tranche 1 which will close on June 16. The president of Macra, John Keane, said that the decision not to include building costs for new dairy parlours in the scheme will come as a “major blow” for young farmers starting out in the dairy sector. “It comes as no surprise unfortunately that the construction costs are not covered under the new TAMS 3. “We have seen a consistent disregard for young farmer supports from the department over the past few years. “Under the last Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) construction costs were eligible for new milking parlours for those qualifying under the Young Farmer Capital Investment Scheme but the new scheme appears not to cover this cost for young farmers,” Keane said. TAMS The Macra president called on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Charlie McConalogue to urgently review the new TAMS. Keane said that farmers who availed of grant aid for robotic milking equipment under the previous TAMS are “also excluded” from the new scheme. “This compares to those who availed of support for solar installation under TAMS 2 are eligible once more under TAMS 3. “At a time when labour is in short supply and the associated benefits for data collection and management garnered by using robots we see the minister excluding farmers who availed of support previously for robotic milking equipment,” he said. “This move is grossly unfair to these farmers as there was no indication in the previous TAMS that any investment under the last CAP would affect future access,” Keane added.',\n",
